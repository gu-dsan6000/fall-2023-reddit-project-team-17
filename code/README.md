# DSAN 6000 Project Code Folder

This document details the various scripts and notebooks created to complete this project. This code is composed of 3 primary sections: `project-eda`, `project-nlp`, and `project-ml`, along with some secondary sections such as `filtering-jobs` and `starter-code`. These will each be detailed and explained below:

## Primary Section 1: `project_eda`

This folder contains all of the notebooks and scripts that comprise the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) portion of our project, excluding data acquisition which is performed in the `filtering_jobs` section. Within the `project-eda` folder are the following files (sorted alphabetically):

* `project-eda-aita-texts.ipynb` : This notebook consists of an initial exploration of the data from a preliminary subset of the overall Reddit data set to the 12 subreddits of interest. Multiple plots are created in this section of the notebook including a bar chart showing the counts of valid text posts from each of the 12 subreddits and a scatterplot comparing the mean post scores and number of comments per valid post. Additionally, there is an initial exploration r/AmItheAsshole in relation to the flair prediction task. The data are subsetted to this subreddit and the number of occurrences of each of these flairs is visualized in a bar chart and treemap as can be seen in the `EDA` section of the website.
