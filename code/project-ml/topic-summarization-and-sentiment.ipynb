People think privatized healthcare shortens waitlines for a doc visit but every patient I get comes in angry that they waited 4 hours for a family doctor or 24 hours for a hospital bed only to wait 15 more minutes for their prescription (and that's PRE pandemic numbers). Insurance companies can change their formularies at any time so your med prices are never actually secure. For-profit hospitals and offices means nurses, docs and pharmacists are often overworked and underpaid. A 10ml vial of insulin runs over a thousand dollars.

Ideally the best method is to just provide your employees with \"deliverables\", goals that need to be accomplished by a set time. How they go about accomplishing those goals and the time they spend on it shouldn't matter as long as the goal is accomplished by the set deadline. If your employee can accomplish this from home without a delay in reaching the deadline, then they should be offered the option to work from home. One coworker of mine who does a lot of data work has moved to this structure under his boss. His boss will tell him he needs the results of the data by a certain date. My co-worker then spends the day time taking care of his young kids. When he puts them to bed for the night, he then hops on his computer and works for 3-4 hours straight uninterrupted. As per his boss, he has never missed a deadline during the 2 years of the pandemic. So as far as his boss is concerned, his employee is doing his tasks, achieving the goals by the deadline, and staying in communication with him.

      "* **They never did anything about inflated housing prices** after the crisis of 2008. They put a few new laws on lending and certain types of financial activities, but the underlying problem never went away. This inaction is driving unaffordable rents and home prices. Corporations are allowed to buy up all (literally all) the houses in a given area if they want, and rent them back to people for whatever amount they want. What do you think this does to the cost of housing? More importantly, why doesn't congress stop them?\n",
      "* **The government has done less than the bare minimum to keep wages decent** for average people. They haven't raised the minimum wage in ages, they do very little to enforce labor laws, let alone enact new ones. I don't know of much the federal government has done, if anything, in 20+ years to support wage growth for working-class people. Simple things like requiring salary ranges on job ads would have been helpful... we are only NOW seeing tiny steps like that, and only at the state level.\n",
      "* **They never did anything to prevent college tuition from going sky high**, in fact they deliberately exacerbated it at the state level by cutting funding for public universities, requiring higher tuition, which allows private schools to raise tuition, etc. The way the government handles student loans also contributes heavily to high tuition prices. For one thing they'll give you incredibly huge amounts of money for student loans. Colleges know this, and charge incredibly huge sums. They also changed bankruptcy law so that you couldn't get rid of student loans even if you declare bankruptcy. For colleges, this is great - whether they charge you $1000 or $100,000, they're guaranteed by law to get their money eventually. So naturally... they charge $100,000. And a lot more.\n",
      "* **The government has done almost nothing to break up monopolies** or even push back on them in DECADES. Ever wonder why Google is allowed to own 90%+ of the search market? Me too. Ever wonder why there are only about 5 giant conglomerates that sell everything in the damn grocery store? Me too. And don't get me started on oil / gas, ISPs, etc. Monopolies are the inevitable outcome of an unregulated free market, and are considered a failure of the market. A Monopoly is the second-worst outcome of a market, right after there being no market at all. Monopolies (and uncompetitive markets in general) are bad because lack of competition means you have no reason to try to improve your product or lower prices. The fewer companies competing in the market, the worse the market. The government hasn't done anything meaningful to maintain competitive markets, and now we are all literally paying the price.\n",
      "* **The healthcare \"system\"** in the US is a cruel joke. Obamacare made a difference, but a relatively small one compared to what Medicare for All would be, and what the rest of the wealthy countries on earth have. This has been known since the 90s when they tried to pass universal healthcare during the Clinton administration.

      "* **GOP obstructionism** started (in earnest) in the mid-1990s primarily by Newt Gingrich. He adopted the policy of simply not voting for anything sponsored by a democrat and generally not doing their jobs, then turning around and blaming \"government\" in general, or \"democrats\" for the failures. This has been disturbingly effective and was kicked into maximum overdrive in 2010 when the GOP took the house during the Obama years. The GOP is now so obstructionist that they voted against Obamacare even though it was originally their idea. They vote against baby formula and they vote against fighting domestic terrorism.

      "* **The electoral college**. This gives a certain amount of votes for the president to states, not people living in those states. As a result, low-density red states end up getting a lot more say in who is president. E.g. Donald Trump lost the popular vote, he just won enough states to take the win anyway.\n",
      "* **Right-wing media.** Say what you want about the New York Times or any other newspaper, \"conservative\" media is in general completely divorced from facts, and when facts are available, intellectual honesty is nothing more than a vague memory. Why are they able to do this? The Fairness Doctrine (the FCC made sure news was actually somewhat fair) was abolished under Reagan, and media ownership rules (limiting how many news stations / papers a corporation could own) were abolished under Clinton. This made it possible to coordinate political messaging across the entire country and disguise it as news.As a result, A steady diet of Rush Limbaugh, Hannity, and Carlson has replaced what might have been actual political opinions with \"Democrats are evil\" and not much else. Political affiliation was also (intentionally) tied to religion, which made people even less likely to hear out the other side.This in turn means that the GOP doesn't need, want, or have any actual policies anymore. (not an exaggeration, their 2020 platform was just \"2016 again plus whatever Trump says\".) \"Stopping the democrats\" is their entire plan, their entire ethos. Stop them from doing what, you ask? Destroying America and instituting muslim satanist atheist communism, I think? Something like that. Doesn't matter, they're bad and no matter how bad the GOP is, democrats would be worse\\*.\n",
      "* The above phenomenon has been supplemented with an unlimited supply of crack and meth by **Facebook and other social media**. Where Hannity or Carlson might have to sound roughly sane on the air, Facebook memes tell your uncle that vaccines have computer chips in them, and HE BELIEVES IT. As a result, the floor for stupid, crazy, or downright dangerous ideas that become popular has fallen to the center of the earth. Or not, because by now they're probably believing in flat earth, too.\n",

I’d also say part of it is price gouging because back when Russia first invaded Ukraine, oil went to $130 a barrel and a gallon of regular gas was around $4 in my area, but now that it’s $120 a barrel, it’s around $5 per gallon of regular gas. So either the cost to refine and transport has gone up (which the cost of transporting it has), they’re refining barrels from when oil became more expensive (I’m not sure how it works honestly), they’re trying to get production back up but it’s taking them awhile, or they’re price gouging.

Tell the doctor that you get severe migraines without water, or that you “have been told by other doctors I need water for my kidney stones.” These teledocs wont run tests or ask questions if you’re just asking for a note for a water bottle.

Yes, most people in China understand that Mao did terrible horrible things which are inexcusable that resulted in the deaths of millions of our countrymen, however generally these things were with the intention of advancing Chinese society and maintaining what the government saw as stability. Mao united what was previously a divided backwards agrarian country and provided the base plate upon which future leaders such as Deng Xiaoping would use to modernize and make China a superpower and for that we as Chinese are thankful. We don’t see him as completely evil like Hitler or Tojo, but rather he falls into a grey area where he committed egregious mistakes but also did much good. The quality of life has exponentially increased in China compared to what it was before, the cities are generally safe enough to walk around at night, economic opportunity is there for those willing to seek it, and the Chinese people are mostly content with the government (sans the recent shitshow that was known as covid).\n",

It’s not intended to be judged by western standards. The Chinese people don’t care about democracy or political freedom as long as the government doesn’t make shit decisions and provides for the people (which China does through universal healthcare, widespread infrastructure, and other measures at least compared to the US). Freedom of speech exists is tolerated now as well. There was a lot of criticism going around on WeChat and other social medias about the recent handling of covid in cities like Shanghai. Just advocating for the overthrow of the government (otherwise known as sedition which is a felony in the US) is not allowed for obvious reasons. Other rights such as these are gradually expanding as well, but the Chinese people give these up in exchange for stability, security, and other government things similar to how Chinese society has been for thousands of years.

      "1) Protect yourself against pregnancy and STIs. Condoms are very effective, although a lot of people use them wrong. They expire and should not be kept in a wallet or in the extreme heater cold such as left in the car. Get tested frequently for STIs. If you are a monogamous and haven't had sex with many people, once a year should be fine, otherwise every couple of months. Make sure you have your hepatitis and HPV vaccines, and monkey pox if you can get one, and consider getting on medication to prevent HIV if you are interested. Some people don't like taking that because it can have side effects, and obviously HIV can be prevented by safe sex practices as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "2) always have clear communication. Be clear with what you want, and listen to the other person. Consent needs to be ongoing, and not caused by manipulation. Communication is also just important in a relationship, and honesty will get you far.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Porn is fake in every way possible. The moans are fake, the bodies are not usual, the cum is fake, and there is rarely any emotional connection.\n",

The first time I had suffered from bulimia and BED for years and during recovery I sort of developed a fuck it kind of attitude and gained fairly rapidly because while I was feeling better mentally I got carried away with bingeing for a while. Then I got the Depo shot and piled on even more! One day I woke up and thought \"this isn't happening anymore\" and spent the next 18 months losing over 100lbs. Kept that off for 17 years, did a lot of weight training and started strongwoman competing. Then the pandemic happened and the weight gain then was gradual and a result of boredom, depression, less exercise and more alcohol. I didn't realise until my husband gently told me he was concerned how much I had gained in a short time and again I had a wake up call and vowed to lose 3 stones in a year, I lost nearly 4.  \n",

      "\n",
      "**1) Evolution is some kind of \"intelligent\" process**. It is not. It is just pure chance slightly in favor of those who have more survival potential. Evolution is not a guy that \"perceives\" that the best equilibrium is two mile in that direction and goes there, regardless of the path. Evolution is blind: just feels where the slope is directed and rolls downhill. This very rarely bring yourself in the best spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2) Humans are unprecedented and thus we elevated ourself over the system**. We don't. We proud ourself being the most intelligent species that ever existed on the planet, and we're probably correct; but many other species are unprecedented in many different ways (number of individuals, speed of reproduction, size, adaptability, resistance to stess, etc) and we have no proof to say that intelligence is inherently better than those characteristics. Besides, we don't have as much control on the survival of our species as we say we have. Raise or lower the temperature of the planet of 4/5°C and watch how the global economy with all of its industrial and scientific might breaks down because we don't know how to produce enough food economically to sustain a population of more than few millions people.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3)** **Humans, evolutionary speaking, are \"OP\"**. We don't know that. Maybe our intelligence and technological prowess will be the very cause of our downfall (e.g.: lethal pandemic, climate change, unsustainable economy, etc). Or maybe, in ten millions years, we will found out that mosquitoes, in their simple-mindedness, outperforms us so much in resilience, reproduction rate and capability of finding food that there is nothing we could do to stop them but seclude ourself to specific areas. In either case, from the point of view of a future enquirer, human would have been a species failing spectacularly quickly in the evolutionary game.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4) Anything on the planet revolves around us.** It doesn't. Sure, there are some global phenomena that are caused by the activity of our species (global warming, plastic pollution, etc) - and we should very careful about that - but we're not gods in control. Most of life exist without feeling the effect of our presence or absence.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) **We're always conscious of when to stop ourselves**. That's wishful thinking. It has been fun and games for our species for the previous 40k years, sure, but evolution often acts on the millions of years. You're assuming that we would know what will be the thing that will end us. Maybe this thing is brewing in this very moment without any of us realizing it. Imaginative example: \"The increase of complexity in society causes widespread stress and depression that abruptly drops the birth rate globally, collapsing the economy and the societal structure as we know them\". \n",

      "The fact that we're conscious of something we should do doesn't mean that we're able to do it. And I'm not talking only about \"not having the technology to do it\", but also not having the economy or the necessary coordination. In the previous example: what would humanity do, as a whole? Accept to return to earlier forms of economy, with the sharp decline in standard of living associated? I don't think anyone would be able to accept it, and no one able to enforce it. Provide pharmaceuticals daily to all people in the world to prevent this stress and depression? What if producing tens of billions of such drugs a day would cost the 40% of the global GDP? That would mean that every family in the world should allocate almost half of its current budget to buy or produce such a drug. It would be impossible, would it? Maybe, after all, it would be better just to live our lives and not to give birth to any children, condemning them to our own sad fate.\n",

We know them as Chihuahuas.  All this lead to a situation where there were basically no city rats in the Americas until colonizers brought highly invasive, disease-carrying brown and roof rats (and house mice, another vector) over, and started a campaign of cultural erasure that destroyed the rat-resistant architecture.\n",

Workers don't get vacations or benefits so they are basically fired or just waiting without pay.  The government steps in and announces unemployment benefits and loan assistance for restaurants.

Part of the reason is that over time, she has come to talk to my husband and me as if she were our boss and not people who were paying her money to occupy part of her property (we are in an in-law unit next door to her larger home). Several weeks ago, she let a friend of hers keep her dog in her back yard (which is parallel to our front door and within 15-20 feet of it) even though she knew the dog was going to be distressed and bark a lot. She e-mailed me telling me that I would be okay with this because my husband, who is a therapist doing telehealth, worked in the bedroom on the other side of our 700 sq. foot house. She didn't ask if it was okay, and she knew I spent 10 months with a neighbor on the other side with 3 dogs that barked for 12 hours a day and had misophonia as a result. She just told me this would be fine with me and gave me no choice.\n",

One month, I didn't notice it was the 20th, but wasn't worried because I was still way ahead of scheduled payment. She e-mailed me later on the 20th and told me she now budgeted based on our early payment and needed to know if I wasn't going to pay like clockwork on that date anymore. She is not entitled to early payment. I was just being diligent and giving myself a buffer in case I forgot to make sure I wasn't late. Now, she feels entitled to that which is ridiculous.\n",

Last May, I let her know that our kitchen faucet was constantly dripping and nothing was done. In September, I let her know it was getting worse and dripping more water more rapidly. The sound of it is maddening, of course, but she suggested I just collect that water in a bucket so it didn't go to waste.\n",

      "On top of that, she has started to increasingly complain about tiny things or to invent problems which are not our fault. Someone ran over a sprinkler at the far edge of her property. It is literally 2 inches from the driveway and people visit her (including her ex-husband) and drive up to her doorway (blocking the path to our car, no less, so we can't get out when her visitors do this). I gave away a portable swamp cooler and she wrote me a terse letter saying those visitors ran over her sprinkler, even though she checked it after they left and said she saw no damage to it. She insists anyone who visits us not use the driveway, yet her visitors continue to drive up to her door.\n",

      "This is my first time renting from someone who lives on the same property or close by, and part of what has increasingly happened is she treats us like fleas on her back and satellites of her wants. She expects us to live 100% the way she feels we should live and doesn't want us to have any autonomy if she imagines a problem might develop for her. This includes not giving water to the deer during drought (they have visited every year since we moved here - 7 years ago) or giving cat treats to a neighbor's cat because she thinks I'm leaving food out that attracts skunks and raccoons (even though the cat eats everything and nothing is left out and those animals have always been around here). She didn't like this year that I put out a self-service Halloween candy table for kids because, when it ran out, she said they rang her doorbell (which I don't believe is true since her lights were off). She also complained bitterly a few years ago because UPS kept mistakenly leaving our packages in front of her house (we have the same address as her, ours just has an \"A\" added to the end of the house number - it's an easy mistake to make). I explained it to UPS, but the delivery people keep changing. We retrieve the packages promptly, but she is just upset we get things at all, especially around Christmas.\n",

I think the main issue is that landlords take your money then treat you like you're invading their space. Every year, I thank her for letting us live here and give her Christmas gifts. Early on in the pandemic, I gave her masks when no one could get their hands on any. We've been really good to her, but she just keeps getting grumpier over time.

It gave people aged 60+ motivation to retire en masse, and many of them did just that, leaving a gaping hole in the workforce; 2. It also forced a lot of people out of unskilled service work and into better jobs that kept them safer, or gave them more control of their lives. The stimulus money gave people time to level up, with education, credentials, or just time to find a better job. These people are all back to work, just not in that dead-end minimum wage job making Subway sandwiches or running the register at 7-11, which is why the public feels it so acutely.

      "It varies from person to person, but there have been many cases of people getting reinfected in less than a month after recovering from a previous infection. It's not really the fault of the vaccines. They are doing what they're supposed to be doing - triggering the immune system to produce antibodies. The problem is the level of response the human immune system mounts against this virus. The antibodies are not very effective at preventing infection, primarily because of the speed that the virus reproduces in the human body, and the antibodies dissipate quickly once the infection is gone. Even with the vaccine or prior infection, a new infection can produce a substantial viral load in your respiratory system before your immune system has begun producing enough new antibodies to fight it off. During this time you will have symptoms, and you will be contagious.\n",
      "\n",
      "This isn't eye opening news to virologists. This was expected. This is how the human immune system responds to every other coronavirus it's been exposed to, including SARS, MERS, and the four that cause the common cold. Immunologists have worked for decades to try to produce vaccines for those other viruses. Most were just as effective as the COVID vaccines we have now, but none were ever approved by the FDA. The COVID vaccines were approved solely because we had a public health emergency. What makes COVID different from those other viruses is the speed with which it replicates in the respiratory tract.\n",
      "\n",
      "What virologists and immunologists were hoping was that this vaccine would provide a window of immunity of at least 3 months, and that we'd get enough of the population immunized in a short enough period of time, so that we would reach herd immunity. [They've now admitted](https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/cdc-director-covid-vaccines-cant-prevent-transmission-anymore/ar-AASDndg) that herd immunity was never possible with this virus because vaccines and prior infections don't provide significant immunity from future infections.\n",
      "\n",
      "What the vaccines and prior infection have done is to reduce the odds of severe infection. A recent vaccine or infection leaves the immune system primed to rapidly begin mass production of antibodies within two or three days. It can't do this quickly enough to stop a new infection from taking hold, but it can do it quickly enough to keep the viral load from getting so high that it triggers a cytokine storm, which is what produces the pneumonia and organ failure that causes the most deaths.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can help your immune system by slowing down the reproduction of the virus, giving the immune system time to ramp up production of antibodies. You can do this by taking zinc supplements or lozenges starting the first day you have symptoms. It has been known to medical researchers for more than a decade that [zinc ions block the production of RNA dependent RNA polymerase](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2973827/), or RDRP - a protein which is essential for the reproduction of RNA within cells. Whenever the virus infects a cell containing zinc ions it won't be able to reproduce, which prevents potentially millions of new virus particles from being released into the respiratory tract. This works so well that OTC cold remedies such as Cold-Eeze are based on it. I tried it the first time I had COVID (Alpha strain), and I felt dramatically better within 12 hours, and this was in early 2021 before I was eligible for the vaccine.\n"

The Supreme Court will determine whether the federal government can mandate vaccinations, but it is established that states have the authority to do so. The state's interest in vaccinating against contagious diseases outweighs the individual's autonomy rights. However, vaccination mandates have been avoided due to potential political backlash or violence.\n",

      "Working in a pharmacy can be frustrating due to issues in privatized healthcare. Patients often experience long wait times for doctors and hospital beds, and even for their prescriptions. Insurance formularies can change unpredictably, making medication prices unstable. Healthcare professionals in for-profit settings are commonly overworked and underpaid. The high cost of certain medications, such as insulin, is a concern. Patent loopholes prolong the availability of cheaper generic drugs. Drug recalls are frequent, and some hospitals charge exorbitant fees for basic items and services. While specialists may be excellent, these positive aspects do not outweigh the negatives.\n",

The author is uncertain about how they will be able to pay off the remaining bills and expresses concerns about the cancer recurring.

They pay for their healthcare through Medicare, which is deducted from their income tax. For the last financial year, their Medicare cost a total of $539 (approximately $391 USD).\n"
