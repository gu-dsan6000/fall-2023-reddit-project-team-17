He is in the bedroom playing video games with friends.  \\nliving room and bedroom are far enough from each other that if someone watches TV you can't hear it in the bedroom.\\nProblem is, he speaks so loudly that I can hear his every last word and exclamation. He also insists on wearing over the ear headphones that exacerbates the problem - in them he doesn't hear how loud he is. (but he's very loud even without the headphones).\\nWhen I ask him to keep it down because it's irritating and I can\"t enjoy my show, he says to get over it.\\nI have tried to not mind it but it drives me crazy, it's like forcing me to pay attention to two things at once. I can't seem to tune it out. My request probably irritates him because he thinks I'm  acting a princess and should get over it. I feel like he could me more considerate and on board to figure something out for both of us, but he really won't even entertain it. I really don't know how to get through to him.</td>\n",

Which working for a living is great but it's overkill. During covid, his ex took him to court for custody stuff and it really stressed him out. They finally had the final hearing and all of it supposed to be done with. I've mentioned several times that we really don't see each other anymore, barely talk on the phone and I'm getting bitter about it. I try to tell him how I feel and he gets aggravated because he doesn't want to talk about that. I was really upset this weekend because he chose not to hang out and go work on a house he is fixing for his friend. I expected at least one day. I was really upset and talked to him about it and after about 45 minutes, he said okay I think 45 minutes is enough time to talk. ð¤·ð»ââï¸ he tells me he loves me and has thought about us living Together. But he doesn't act that way. It hurt me so bad. I get my feelings hurt easily so that's why I'm trying to get feedback. I feel like I can't talk to him about anything, that I'm always a bother and I'm asking him to do things he clearly doesn't want to do. He says he doesn't want to break up and that things are fine with him . But I'm kinda miserable because he seems like a part time boyfriend. I keep hoping he will do things differently but it's not happening. My friends keep telling me to wait and give him more time. I've cried tonight just thinking about letting him go because only one of us is getting what we want essentially.  I feel really comfy with him and when we are together, it's great. But I look a lot towards the future and I don't see him wanting anything like that. Any ideas or help on what I should do or am I being over emotional?</td>\n",

Iâve always wanted a NYE wedding and because of covid we decided next year is too soon and weâre going to wait until 2022. \\n\\nMy health insurance sucks though and Iâm on a medicine that isnât even covered so in total I spend over $600 a month on the insurance and medicine. If I were on his insurance it would be about $175 a month for the insurance and medicine. And it would include vision and dental which I donât currently have. \\n\\nMy parents are aware of the idea and are completely on board with it. The idea has also been brought up to his parents and they did not seem to have a problem with it. Everyone knows that would we save so much money by doing so and that there are a lot of other things that the money could be spent on.  I should also mention that the other benefit of getting married is that I deeply love this man and am thankful everyday that heâs with me. It isnât just about the health insurance! \\n\\nWhat weâre unsure about is if we should have a small ceremony and include our immediate family? Or if we just go down to the courthouse and not tell anyone? We donât want to make a huge deal about it and have it take away from the wedding with all of our loved ones in 2022. I know itâs just a piece of paper but I do feel like it has a lot of significance behind and I donât want to regret how we go about it.\\n\\nHas anyone done this and/or have any advice?</td>\n",

We matched online and we started talking, we exchanged phone numbers, social media accounts etc. I have talked to her over the phone multiple times and for hours. I have enjoyed talking to her and I think she does too. I can tell she has a strong personality and doesnât want to reveal herself. I have actually asked her out couple times, but something came up each time. One time she was out of town, another time she was over to her friendâs house. She didnât lie to me cause I have her Instagram account and I can confirm that in both cases she was telling the truth. Actually there was another time that I asked her out, and that time she told me that she had problems with her car, so I offered myself to go pick her up, but she didnât reply to me that day so I assumed she didnât want to.\\n\\nAt this point I started to ignore her.. but she always came back to me. She watches every single story I post on Instagram, and most of the time she replies too. I didnât talk to her for about ten days last time around, and boom she sent me a message saying that we should go out for an hike. I told her that I had to confirm to her since it was around the holidays ( New Years week) and donât know if I had time for that particular day. Once I got back to her and told her that I was actually free that day and I could go out with her, she saw the message and didnât reply tough... Couple days ago, once again she sees my story on Instagram and replies to me.. I donât know if she is that insecure or she likes to be chased or what. She also told me before this last episode that she hopes to see me in 2021... what do you do of her ? She likes me ? She is playing games ? She is just insecure ? To be honest if we were not in a pandemic, I probably donât think I would have waited all this time on her.</td>\n",

I currently work at a small firm, but my current boss became a good friend and mentored me in the industry for the past 2 years. I look up to this guy like a professional father figure. \\n\\nWe are a small firm, and I have a ton of responsibility. I even pushed back the start date until mid February so I can continue to train the person who I anticipate will take my role. \\n\\nI fee horrible, but it is legitimately my dream job and they are also doubling my pay. I donât really know what Iâm asking for - but maybe some advice from someone who was at some time in a similar position?\\n\\nThank you guys.\\n\\nEdit: I apologize I should have been more clear - my current boss is the majority owner of the firm!\\n\\nHi Guys - I just woke up and saw a ton of responses! I just wanted to say thank you very much! Each person had great advice and I will give an update tomorrow night when I speak with him!</td>\n",

       "      <td>Long story short, wife (31f) and I (32m) have had a rocky relationship these past few months. We have a 1 year old son together and I moved out for a few months in September to be with my own family and try to collect myself. \\n\\nA lot of our issues are because of me and I'm just trying to figure out if this marriage is salvageable or not. I haven't been the best father or husband, I'm trying to do better for her and our son but she's having trouble with everything herself. \\n\\nFor the record, there has been no infidelity on either part, our issues are because we both have problems communicating and rather than talk about my own issues I would brush them under the rug and say I'm fine until I would hit my breaking point which is why I initially left. Also, before anything ever came of this relationship I lied about a lot of things because I don't like anyone knowing the truth about me. I came clean to her about everything after I left and am in therapy for it. Most of it pertains to my shitty childhood / teenage years. Anyways, she feels like she can't trust anything I say anymore and I get that. \\n\\nNow I'm back, initially it was only supposed to be for the holidays but now she's asked me to stay and help co-parent which I've been doing. She also doesn't want me to sleep on the couch but in our bed together. Sometimes she wants to cuddle, other times she is very cold towards me. \\n\\nMoving forward she says that we are getting a divorce but other times she'll talk about the future as though we're still together and different things she'd like for us to do as a family. Some days she hates me and I'm getting a lot of mixed signals and it feels like I'm walking on egg shells 90% of the time. \\n\\nSo reddit, what should I do?\\nPersonally, I would like to save the marriage, I do love her and our son dearly.

       "      <td>I (22M) am dating a (21F). We both started seeing each other in university. Later on we ended up moving in together. My GF (21F) is depressive, anxious and suicidal. She hates her self for no apparent reason. All of these negative thoughts have made her have severe brain fog and also be unable to focus on herself, her studies in which she is suffering badly and socially (as she has no other friends other than me) and is eventually making the suicidal and self harm thoughts even worse. A lot of times she does not share these thoughts with me or does at a later point in time for which initially I would get offended and act out, but now I thank her for sharing it with me. I have spent hours and hours talking to her and making her realize her self worth, plan her school out and also seek the medical help she needs (therapy, anxiety pills etc). Currently I am pushing her through a therapist, however each day she seems to hate herself more and more. We both do have our own rooms so she ends up going to hers and just being there the whole day, not eating and drinking unless forced to do so. I (22M) on the other hand am doing well with school or at least trying and suffer from severe anxiety for the past 5 years, however I have been on medications before but now I try to cope with it myself as I have somewhat become used to being anxious. Regardless, all of this has been taking a severe toll on my own mental health (Which is not a concern as long as she gets better). I also am scared to be with a person who can harm or kill themselves whenever whereas I expect to share my life with them. Is there something I can do better? What is my best course of action?\\n\\nThank you. \\n\\nI am sorry if I missed something, i will keep adding it as an edit.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I was talking to this girl who was really cool to me, she was extremely pretty to me and she just had an overall amazing personality to me. We went on a first date, we had a lot of fun and nothing happen, no hand holding or kissing but as she was leaving, she said something in the sense of âI would kiss you butâ and just left the car. Christmas comes around, she asks me to come up and spend the night at her place so I drove a few hours to come up and spend time with her. We spend the day with each other, it was really great and finally in bed, she kisses me the first time and I just melted. Later that night, I remember us making out and we ended up doing stuff together (never leading to sex) and I remember us at some point just turning around and going back to sleep. I wake up to her head on my chest and also to her hands down my pants trying to jerk me off. I woke up a bit confused but I wasnât offended, I just woke up kinda like âHaâ and laughed it off. She all of a sudden goes âWhy would you do that?â and Iâm like âDo what?â âTouch me in my sleepâ and at this point Iâm like âWhoa. Wtf no, we were kissing and you were moaning and never resisted, if you were to tell me at that point like âHey no Iâm okayâ I wouldâve def been like âOkay my badâ but you were kissing me and holding me, do you want me to leave? I didnât mean to make you feel uncomfortableâ and she says âNo, you can stayâ so I start feeling sick and start throwing up in her bathroom just from my anxiety. Itâs like 7 in the morning, so I awkwardly crawl back into bed trying to figure my feelings out and she puts her arms around me asking if Iâm okay and Iâm like âNo, youâre telling me I did this when I have a total different view of what happenedâ and she falls asleep with me. Iâm going home, she gives me a hug and goes âText me so I know you got home safe, feel better ð¥ºâ and so I drive back home. Sheâs giving her view on what happened and how she feels about the whole situation, at this point Iâm explaining on how I remember the situation happening and she goes âI jerked you off as retaliation and I donât remember kissing you but if I did then okayâ and Iâm like âOkayâ so during this time, sheâs acting normal with me but Iâm still very weary of this whole thing since Iâm not sure what weâre suppose to do. She ends up making these rude jokes about my appearance saying I look like her ex but a 12 year old version and just makes jokes about my overall personality. \\n\\nDuring this whole time, Iâm texting my friends confused on what to do since Iâve never been in a situation like that before. Iâm a huge hopeless romantic dude who doesnât get off hurting women so this really affected my personality and physical feeling for the next few days. I explain to her that this painting she has of me isnât right and itâs not my true character but I just remember the incident happening completely differently. I tell her like I think she would start over again since Iâm ngl I have a different view of her too since that started and she goes âI agreeâ so we end up talking on the phone, FaceTiming with each other, and everything felt back to normal. \\n\\nNot even 5 days later, sheâs still talking to me and explained that she feels like she canât trust me because of that night. Iâm over here trying to explain like I think it was miscommunication on both ends of what happened just because I feel like her lack of saying anything + her actions of âretaliationâ arenât very clear to me nor are they logical. December 31st comes by and she asks me to come over, Iâm a bit surprised but I have nothing else to do and Iâm thinking of ways to spend the day with her. The first maybe 30 minutes of us hanging out at her place were a bit off but it ended with her kissing me, letting me hold her, and us watching Pixarâs âSoulâ on her couch. We went to her bedroom, we watched shows, and we laid with each other just laughing the night away and just having an overall great night. Weâre painting too and she all of a sudden smacks my ass but I didnât really care lol she ends up laying on me and I just ask her âCan I kiss you?â and she says yes so we end up kissing for a minute but once again, it leads to nothing since Iâm cautious of that now. We fall asleep on her bed, I slept in my boxers and she slept in her stuff, we woke up around 8 and everything was totally cool. I gave her a kiss on the cheek and told her how cool she was, she smiled and giggled, she gave me a big hug back and played w my hair. So I pack up my stuff, give her a kiss on the cheek (she didnât brush her teeth so she didnât want to kiss me lol) and I drove back home. She told me to text her once I got home, I did and I was really proud of my our time together since it was such a success. \\n\\nShe ignored me for a few hours and Iâm like âeh, sheâs probably busy whateverâ and then she texts me saying that this wonât work because I donât give her space + she isnât happy with us + she makes jokes about me as a wall + she canât get over the first night + doesnât enjoy time with me, she just leaves it at that. I feel like my time was completely wasted and Iâm a bit mad that I spent New Years Eve with someone who invited me over but apparently didnât want me there? We ate dinner together, laughing, painting, holding each other, and just having a great time overall but all of a sudden, itâs taken a completely different turn.

Together a long time. \\nIt seems like every night we have the same argument.\\nFor example right now I'm in the living room, trying to watch tv. He is in the bedroom playing video games with friends.  \\nliving room and bedroom are far enough from each other that if someone watches TV you can't hear it in the bedroom.\\nProblem is, he speaks so loudly that I can hear his every last word and exclamation. He also insists on wearing over the ear headphones that exacerbates the problem - in them he doesn't hear how loud he is. (but he's very loud even without the headphones).\\nWhen I ask him to keep it down because it's irritating and I can\"t enjoy my show, he says to get over it.\\nI have tried to not mind it but it drives me crazy, it's like forcing me to pay attention to two things at once. I can't seem to tune it out. My request probably irritates him because he thinks I'm  acting a princess and should get over it. I feel like he could me more considerate and on board to figure something out for both of us, but he really won't even entertain it. I really don't know how to get through to him.   \n",

He is always on the phone or physically working. Which working for a living is great but it's overkill. During covid, his ex took him to court for custody stuff and it really stressed him out. They finally had the final hearing and all of it supposed to be done with. I've mentioned several times that we really don't see each other anymore, barely talk on the phone and I'm getting bitter about it. I try to tell him how I feel and he gets aggravated because he doesn't want to talk about that. I was really upset this weekend because he chose not to hang out and go work on a house he is fixing for his friend. I expected at least one day. I was really upset and talked to him about it and after about 45 minutes, he said okay I think 45 minutes is enough time to talk. ð¤·ð»ââï¸ he tells me he loves me and has thought about us living Together. But he doesn't act that way. It hurt me so bad. I get my feelings hurt easily so that's why I'm trying to get feedback. I feel like I can't talk to him about anything, that I'm always a bother and I'm asking him to do things he clearly doesn't want to do. He says he doesn't want to break up and that things are fine with him . But I'm kinda miserable because he seems like a part time boyfriend. I keep hoping he will do things differently but it's not happening. My friends keep telling me to wait and give him more time. I've cried tonight just thinking about letting him go because only one of us is getting what we want essentially.  I feel really comfy with him and when we are together, it's great. But I look a lot towards the future and I don't see him wanting anything like that. Any ideas or help on what I should do or am I being over emotional?   \n",

She went to his house and saw a knife under his bed. He was living alone in this apartment. She knew it was for his safety and protection but she said the dude was joking around âYou know Iâm a dangerous guy. I can kill youâ. He put away the knife back in the kitchen. They had a good night. She said she was really having fun with him. The only thing was whenever she said sheâll go home, the dude would sit on her lap. Heâs really heavy she said so she couldnât go anywhere. \\n\\nI adviced my bestfriend if the dude still have a some âmehâ traits on the next few dates. I think she should stop seeing her just give him another chance cause I could see she had fun with that guy. I donât want to discouraged her. \\n\\nShe said she was kind scared with his âkill youâ joke but she would still continue seeing him thatâs why I said gave it another chance. Did I really do the right thing?   \n",

sandwich is just cheese and bread. Not cheese and ham, not cheese and chicken, not cheese and turkey, not cheese and veggies. Once you add something other than cheese itâs called a MELT. A turkey and cheese melt, a ham and cheese melt, etc.   \n",

Iâve always wanted a NYE wedding and because of covid we decided next year is too soon and weâre going to wait until 2022. \\n\\nMy health insurance sucks though and Iâm on a medicine that isnât even covered so in total I spend over $600 a month on the insurance and medicine. If I were on his insurance it would be about $175 a month for the insurance and medicine. And it would include vision and dental which I donât currently have. \\n\\nMy parents are aware of the idea and are completely on board with it. The idea has also been brought up to his parents and they did not seem to have a problem with it. Everyone knows that would we save so much money by doing so and that there are a lot of other things that the money could be spent on.  I should also mention that the other benefit of getting married is that I deeply love this man and am thankful everyday that heâs with me. It isnât just about the health insurance! \\n\\nWhat weâre unsure about is if we should have a small ceremony and include our immediate family? Or if we just go down to the courthouse and not tell anyone? We donât want to make a huge deal about it and have it take away from the wedding with all of our loved ones in 2022. I know itâs just a piece of paper but I do feel like it has a lot of significance behind and I donât want to regret how we go about it.\\n\\nHas anyone done this and/or have any advice?   \n",

taste of their beverage is better than the literal thousands of better tasting options available to them. They will also ridicule the people who like to drink their beverage with some additive that makes it not taste like a butthole.   \n",

I have been talking with girl for quite awhile now, but havenât been on an official date yet. We matched online and we started talking, we exchanged phone numbers, social media accounts etc. I have talked to her over the phone multiple times and for hours. I have enjoyed talking to her and I think she does too. I can tell she has a strong personality and doesnât want to reveal herself. I have actually asked her out couple times, but something came up each time. One time she was out of town, another time she was over to her friendâs house. She didnât lie to me cause I have her Instagram account and I can confirm that in both cases she was telling the truth. Actually there was another time that I asked her out, and that time she told me that she had problems with her car, so I offered myself to go pick her up, but she didnât reply to me that day so I assumed she didnât want to.\\n\\nAt this point I started to ignore her.. but she always came back to me. She watches every single story I post on Instagram, and most of the time she replies too. I didnât talk to her for about ten days last time around, and boom she sent me a message saying that we should go out for an hike. I told her that I had to confirm to her since it was around the holidays ( New Years week) and donât know if I had time for that particular day. Once I got back to her and told her that I was actually free that day and I could go out with her, she saw the message and didnât reply tough... Couple days ago, once again she sees my story on Instagram and replies to me.. I donât know if she is that insecure or she likes to be chased or what. She also told me before this last episode that she hopes to see me in 2021... what do you do of her ? She likes me ? She is playing games ? She is just insecure ? To be honest if we were not in a pandemic, I probably donât think I would have waited all this time on her.   \n",

Basic needs feels impossible to achieve. Maybe I'm just lazy, or maybe I'm just depressed...but man I'm lucky to live with family, but still I hate being stuck with no indepence. I wish I could just be free with my own car, house, money, etc. Don't get wrong, i work only two days a week early mornings, and I love it!\\n\\nbut I dread full-time work! Seriously where does it end!? ....And just trying to make a career is tiresome. It's funny how we're trapped in this boring endless dystopia where everything is just grey, boring....how can anyone like this!?   \n",

I currently work at a small firm, but my current boss became a good friend and mentored me in the industry for the past 2 years. I look up to this guy like a professional father figure. \\n\\nWe are a small firm, and I have a ton of responsibility. I even pushed back the start date until mid February so I can continue to train the person who I anticipate will take my role. \\n\\nI fee horrible, but it is legitimately my dream job and they are also doubling my pay. I donât really know what Iâm asking for - but maybe some advice from someone who was at some time in a similar position?\\n\\nThank you guys.\\n\\nEdit: I apologize I should have been more clear - my current boss is the majority owner of the firm!\\n\\nHi Guys - I just woke up and saw a ton of responses! I just wanted to say thank you very much! Each person had great advice and I will give an update tomorrow night when I speak with him!   \n",

             Take my friend for example. I've seen him smile after laughing at a joke or smirk when he sees something he likes, but then in all his pictures, his smile looks like he just kinda opened his lips but clenched his teeth.   \n",

We have a 1 year old son together and I moved out for a few months in September to be with my own family and try to collect myself. \\n\\nA lot of our issues are because of me and I'm just trying to figure out if this marriage is salvageable or not. I haven't been the best father or husband, I'm trying to do better for her and our son but she's having trouble with everything herself. \\n\\nFor the record, there has been no infidelity on either part, our issues are because we both have problems communicating and rather than talk about my own issues I would brush them under the rug and say I'm fine until I would hit my breaking point which is why I initially left. Also, before anything ever came of this relationship I lied about a lot of things because I don't like anyone knowing the truth about me. I came clean to her about everything after I left and am in therapy for it. Most of it pertains to my shitty childhood / teenage years. Anyways, she feels like she can't trust anything I say anymore and I get that. \\n\\nNow I'm back, initially it was only supposed to be for the holidays but now she's asked me to stay and help co-parent which I've been doing. She also doesn't want me to sleep on the couch but in our bed together. Sometimes she wants to cuddle, other times she is very cold towards me. \\n\\nMoving forward she says that we are getting a divorce but other times she'll talk about the future as though we're still together and different things she'd like for us to do as a family. Some days she hates me and I'm getting a lot of mixed signals and it feels like I'm walking on egg shells 90% of the time. \\n\\nSo reddit, what should I do?\\nPersonally, I would like to save the marriage, I do love her and our son dearly.

started looking around for bank loans to start a workers co-op's. In my country, Sweden, there's a state finance thingy called Almi that gives loans to people wanting to start businesses. I want the co-op because the workers should reap the benefits, not shareholders, and only work MAX 6 hrs a day.\\n\\nWhat is the equivalent in your country in terms of loan institutions?\\n\\nSpread the info so people can get out of the endless job cycle   \n",

I've tried, I found it insipid), I do know who he is because I also train BJJ. I just came across this post &lt;&lt;https://www.reddit.com/r/thefighterandthekid/comments/kndal6/is_the_jre_empire_now_just_a_slowly_crumbling/ghjy4rn/&gt;&gt;, and I have no idea what /r/joerogan2 is or what the OP meant about being \"*made homeless when Rogan's copyright goons tore down my home at /r/joerogan2*\". Can someone give me a short synopsis?   \n",

We both started seeing each other in university. Later on we ended up moving in together. My GF (21F) is depressive, anxious and suicidal. She hates her self for no apparent reason. All of these negative thoughts have made her have severe brain fog and also be unable to focus on herself, her studies in which she is suffering badly and socially (as she has no other friends other than me) and is eventually making the suicidal and self harm thoughts even worse. A lot of times she does not share these thoughts with me or does at a later point in time for which initially I would get offended and act out, but now I thank her for sharing it with me. I have spent hours and hours talking to her and making her realize her self worth, plan her school out and also seek the medical help she needs (therapy, anxiety pills etc). Currently I am pushing her through a therapist, however each day she seems to hate herself more and more. We both do have our own rooms so she ends up going to hers and just being there the whole day, not eating and drinking unless forced to do so. I (22M) on the other hand am doing well with school or at least trying and suffer from severe anxiety for the past 5 years, however I have been on medications before but now I try to cope with it myself as I have somewhat become used to being anxious. Regardless, all of this has been taking a severe toll on my own mental health (Which is not a concern as long as she gets better). I also am scared to be with a person who can harm or kill themselves whenever whereas I expect to share my life with them. Is there something I can do better? What is my best course of action?\\n\\nThank you. \\n\\nI am sorry if I missed something, i will keep adding it as an edit.   \n",
       "18  I was talking to this girl who was really cool to me, she was extremely pretty to me and she just had an overall amazing personality to me. We went on a first date, we had a lot of fun and nothing happen, no hand holding or kissing but as she was leaving, she said something in the sense of âI would kiss you butâ and just left the car. Christmas comes around, she asks me to come up and spend the night at her place so I drove a few hours to come up and spend time with her. We spend the day with each other, it was really great and finally in bed, she kisses me the first time and I just melted. Later that night, I remember us making out and we ended up doing stuff together (never leading to sex) and I remember us at some point just turning around and going back to sleep. I wake up to her head on my chest and also to her hands down my pants trying to jerk me off. I woke up a bit confused but I wasnât offended, I just woke up kinda like âHaâ and laughed it off. She all of a sudden goes âWhy would you do that?â and Iâm like âDo what?â âTouch me in my sleepâ and at this point Iâm like âWhoa. Wtf no, we were kissing and you were moaning and never resisted, if you were to tell me at that point like âHey no Iâm okayâ I wouldâve def been like âOkay my badâ but you were kissing me and holding me, do you want me to leave? I didnât mean to make you feel uncomfortableâ and she says âNo, you can stayâ so I start feeling sick and start throwing up in her bathroom just from my anxiety. Itâs like 7 in the morning, so I awkwardly crawl back into bed trying to figure my feelings out and she puts her arms around me asking if Iâm okay and Iâm like âNo, youâre telling me I did this when I have a total different view of what happenedâ and she falls asleep with me. Iâm going home, she gives me a hug and goes âText me so I know you got home safe, feel better ð¥ºâ and so I drive back home. Sheâs giving her view on what happened and how she feels about the whole situation, at this point Iâm explaining on how I remember the situation happening and she goes âI jerked you off as retaliation and I donât remember kissing you but if I did then okayâ and Iâm like âOkayâ so during this time, sheâs acting normal with me but Iâm still very weary of this whole thing since Iâm not sure what weâre suppose to do. She ends up making these rude jokes about my appearance saying I look like her ex but a 12 year old version and just makes jokes about my overall personality. \\n\\nDuring this whole time, Iâm texting my friends confused on what to do since Iâve never been in a situation like that before. Iâm a huge hopeless romantic dude who doesnât get off hurting women so this really affected my personality and physical feeling for the next few days. I explain to her that this painting she has of me isnât right and itâs not my true character but I just remember the incident happening completely differently. I tell her like I think she would start over again since Iâm ngl I have a different view of her too since that started and she goes âI agreeâ so we end up talking on the phone, FaceTiming with each other, and everything felt back to normal. \\n\\nNot even 5 days later, sheâs still talking to me and explained that she feels like she canât trust me because of that night. Iâm over here trying to explain like I think it was miscommunication on both ends of what happened just because I feel like her lack of saying anything + her actions of âretaliationâ arenât very clear to me nor are they logical. December 31st comes by and she asks me to come over, Iâm a bit surprised but I have nothing else to do and Iâm thinking of ways to spend the day with her. The first maybe 30 minutes of us hanging out at her place were a bit off but it ended with her kissing me, letting me hold her, and us watching Pixarâs âSoulâ on her couch. We went to her bedroom, we watched shows, and we laid with each other just laughing the night away and just having an overall great night. Weâre painting too and she all of a sudden smacks my ass but I didnât really care lol she ends up laying on me and I just ask her âCan I kiss you?â and she says yes so we end up kissing for a minute but once again, it leads to nothing since Iâm cautious of that now. We fall asleep on her bed, I slept in my boxers and she slept in her stuff, we woke up around 8 and everything was totally cool. I gave her a kiss on the cheek and told her how cool she was, she smiled and giggled, she gave me a big hug back and played w my hair. So I pack up my stuff, give her a kiss on the cheek (she didnât brush her teeth so she didnât want to kiss me lol) and I drove back home. She told me to text her once I got home, I did and I was really proud of my our time together since it was such a success. \\n\\nShe ignored me for a few hours and Iâm like âeh, sheâs probably busy whateverâ and then she texts me saying that this wonât work because I donât give her space + she isnât happy with us + she makes jokes about me as a wall + she canât get over the first night + doesnât enjoy time with me, she just leaves it at that. I feel like my time was completely wasted and Iâm a bit mad that I spent New Years Eve with someone who invited me over but apparently didnât want me there? We ate dinner together, laughing, painting, holding each other, and just having a great time overall but all of a sudden, itâs taken a completely different turn. Do I have the right to feel a bit used?   \n",

We have so much in common and hes such an easy going guy hes so sweet to me and he hes the one who trained me when i first got this job. We texted each other everyday and talked about how are day went . my boyfriend was starting to get suspicious one day and i told him im just talking to a friend . so  my co-worker asked me out to dinner. He took me to a nice restraunt we had a good time . we left around 1am he took me to his place and we watched a movie . it was really cold and i was getting tired so i leaned on his shoulder and next thing you know i felasleep i wokeup in the morning and he took me home . i got home and slept some more .\\nAs soon as i wokeup my boyfriend starts asking me where ive been all night . and i told him i was out with a friend he says i know you were i saw your text messages with your co worker. Then he grabbed my neck and slapped me across my face 3-5 times . i kicked him off me and ran to the restroom and locked the door . then he broke the door down ! Pinned me on the ground and was sitting on top of me i felt like i couldn't breath . he demanded me to tell him everything me and my co worker did when we went out so i did . then he left . i was in so much shock and afraid to leave the house so i just stayed home and went back to bed . my boyfriend came back home a few hours later and he was apologizing saying he didnt know what got into him that he lost his temper. then we had sex because he initiated it and i didnt know what else to do i feel like this is all my fault . i feel i did this to myself . im lost for words.\\n\\n(22f) (28m)   \n",

He is in the bedroom playing video games with friends.  \\nliving room and bedroom are far enough from each other that if someone watches TV you can't hear it in the bedroom.\\nProblem is, he speaks so loudly that I can hear his every last word and exclamation. He also insists on wearing over the ear headphones that exacerbates the problem - in them he doesn't hear how loud he is. (but he's very loud even without the headphones).\\nWhen I ask him to keep it down because it's irritating and I can\"t enjoy my show, he says to get over it.\\nI have tried to not mind it but it drives me crazy, it's like forcing me to pay attention to two things at once. I can't seem to tune it out. My request probably irritates him because he thinks I'm  acting a princess and should get over it. I feel like he could me more considerate and on board to figure something out for both of us, but he really won't even entertain it. I really don't know how to get through to him.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I've been with this guy for about 10 months, he is super busy all of the time with multiple businesses. He is always on the phone or physically working. Which working for a living is great but it's overkill. During covid, his ex took him to court for custody stuff and it really stressed him out. They finally had the final hearing and all of it supposed to be done with. I've mentioned several times that we really don't see each other anymore, barely talk on the phone and I'm getting bitter about it. I try to tell him how I feel and he gets aggravated because he doesn't want to talk about that. I was really upset this weekend because he chose not to hang out and go work on a house he is fixing for his friend. I expected at least one day. I was really upset and talked to him about it and after about 45 minutes, he said okay I think 45 minutes is enough time to talk. ð¤·ð»ââï¸ he tells me he loves me and has thought about us living Together. But he doesn't act that way. It hurt me so bad. I get my feelings hurt easily so that's why I'm trying to get feedback. I feel like I can't talk to him about anything, that I'm always a bother and I'm asking him to do things he clearly doesn't want to do. He says he doesn't want to break up and that things are fine with him . But I'm kinda miserable because he seems like a part time boyfriend. I keep hoping he will do things differently but it's not happening. My friends keep telling me to wait and give him more time. I've cried tonight just thinking about letting him go because only one of us is getting what we want essentially.  I feel really comfy with him and when we are together, it's great. But I look a lot towards the future and I don't see him wanting anything like that. Any ideas or help on what I should do or am I being over emotional?</td>\n",

They had a good night. She said she was really having fun with him. The only thing was whenever she said sheâll go home, the dude would sit on her lap.

Together a long time. \\nIt seems like every night we have the same argument.\\nFor example right now I'm in the living room, trying to watch tv. He is in the bedroom playing video games with friends.  \\nliving room and bedroom are far enough from each other that if someone watches TV you can't hear it in the bedroom.\\nProblem is, he speaks so loudly that I can hear his every last word and exclamation. He also insists on wearing over the ear headphones that exacerbates the problem - in them he doesn't hear how loud he is. (but he's very loud even without the headphones).\\nWhen I ask him to keep it down because it's irritating and I can\"t enjoy my show, he says to get over it.\\nI have tried to not mind it but it drives me crazy, it's like forcing me to pay attention to two things at once. I can't seem to tune it out. My request probably irritates him because he thinks I'm  acting a princess and should get over it. I feel like he could me more considerate and on board to figure something out for both of us, but he really won't even entertain it. I really don't know how to get through to him.   \n",
       "2  I've been with this guy for about 10 months, he is super busy all of the time with multiple businesses. He is always on the phone or physically working. Which working for a living is great but it's overkill. During covid, his ex took him to court for custody stuff and it really stressed him out. They finally had the final hearing and all of it supposed to be done with. I've mentioned several times that we really don't see each other anymore, barely talk on the phone and I'm getting bitter about it. I try to tell him how I feel and he gets aggravated because he doesn't want to talk about that. I was really upset this weekend because he chose not to hang out and go work on a house he is fixing for his friend. I expected at least one day. I was really upset and talked to him about it and after about 45 minutes, he said okay I think 45 minutes is enough time to talk. ð¤·ð»ââï¸ he tells me he loves me and has thought about us living Together. But he doesn't act that way. It hurt me so bad. I get my feelings hurt easily so that's why I'm trying to get feedback. I feel like I can't talk to him about anything, that I'm always a bother and I'm asking him to do things he clearly doesn't want to do. He says he doesn't want to break up and that things are fine with him . But I'm kinda miserable because he seems like a part time boyfriend. I keep hoping he will do things differently but it's not happening. My friends keep telling me to wait and give him more time. I've cried tonight just thinking about letting him go because only one of us is getting what we want essentially.  I feel really comfy with him and when we are together, it's great. But I look a lot towards the future and I don't see him wanting anything like that. Any ideas or help on what I should do or am I being over emotional?   \n",

She went to his house and saw a knife under his bed. He was living alone in this apartment. She knew it was for his safety and protection but she said the dude was joking around âYou know Iâm a dangerous guy. I can kill youâ. He put away the knife back in the kitchen. They had a good night. She said she was really having fun with him. The only thing was whenever she said sheâll go home, the dude would sit on her lap. Heâs really heavy she said so she couldnât go anywhere. \\n\\nI adviced my bestfriend if the dude still have a some âmehâ traits on the next few dates. I think she should stop seeing her just give him another chance cause I could see she had fun with that guy.

He is in the bedroom playing video games with friends.  \\nliving room and bedroom are far enough from each other that if someone watches TV you can't hear it in the bedroom.\\nProblem is, he speaks so loudly that I can hear his every last word and exclamation. He also insists on wearing over the ear headphones that exacerbates the problem - in them he doesn't hear how loud he is. (but he's very loud even without the headphones).\\nWhen I ask him to keep it down because it's irritating and I can\"t enjoy my show, he says to get over it.\\nI have tried to not mind it but it drives me crazy, it's like forcing me to pay attention to two things at once. I can't seem to tune it out. My request probably irritates him because he thinks I'm  acting a princess and should get over it. I feel like he could me more considerate and on board to figure something out for both of us, but he really won't even entertain it. I really don't know how to get through to him.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I've been with this guy for about 10 months, he is super busy all of the time with multiple businesses. He is always on the phone or physically working. Which working for a living is great but it's overkill. During covid, his ex took him to court for custody stuff and it really stressed him out. They finally had the final hearing and all of it supposed to be done with. I've mentioned several times that we really don't see each other anymore, barely talk on the phone and I'm getting bitter about it. I try to tell him how I feel and he gets aggravated because he doesn't want to talk about that. I was really upset this weekend because he chose not to hang out and go work on a house he is fixing for his friend. I expected at least one day. I was really upset and talked to him about it and after about 45 minutes, he said okay I think 45 minutes is enough time to talk. ð¤·ð»ââï¸ he tells me he loves me and has thought about us living Together. But he doesn't act that way. It hurt me so bad. I get my feelings hurt easily so that's why I'm trying to get feedback. I feel like I can't talk to him about anything, that I'm always a bother and I'm asking him to do things he clearly doesn't want to do. He says he doesn't want to break up and that things are fine with him . But I'm kinda miserable because he seems like a part time boyfriend. I keep hoping he will do things differently but it's not happening. My friends keep telling me to wait and give him more time. I've cried tonight just thinking about letting him go because only one of us is getting what we want essentially.  I feel really comfy with him and when we are together, it's great. But I look a lot towards the future and I don't see him wanting anything like that. Any ideas or help on what I should do or am I being over emotional?</td>\n",

Iâve always wanted a NYE wedding and because of covid we decided next year is too soon and weâre going to wait until 2022. \\n\\nMy health insurance sucks though and Iâm on a medicine that isnât even covered so in total I spend over $600 a month on the insurance and medicine. If I were on his insurance it would be about $175 a month for the insurance and medicine. And it would include vision and dental which I donât currently have. \\n\\nMy parents are aware of the idea and are completely on board with it. The idea has also been brought up to his parents and they did not seem to have a problem with it. Everyone knows that would we save so much money by doing so and that there are a lot of other things that the money could be spent on.  I should also mention that the other benefit of getting married is that I deeply love this man and am thankful everyday that heâs with me. It isnât just about the health insurance! \\n\\nWhat weâre unsure about is if we should have a small ceremony and include our immediate family? Or if we just go down to the courthouse and not tell anyone? We donât want to make a huge deal about it and have it take away from the wedding with all of our loved ones in 2022. I know itâs just a piece of paper but I do feel like it has a lot of significance behind and I donât want to regret how we go about it.\\n\\nHas anyone done this and/or have any advice?</td>\n",

Together a long time. \\nIt seems like every night we have the same argument.\\nFor example right now I'm in the living room, trying to watch tv. He is in the bedroom playing video games with friends.  \\nliving room and bedroom are far enough from each other that if someone watches TV you can't hear it in the bedroom.\\nProblem is, he speaks so loudly that I can hear his every last word and exclamation. He also insists on wearing over the ear headphones that exacerbates the problem - in them he doesn't hear how loud he is. (but he's very loud even without the headphones).\\nWhen I ask him to keep it down because it's irritating and I can\"t enjoy my show, he says to get over it.\\nI have tried to not mind it but it drives me crazy, it's like forcing me to pay attention to two things at once. I can't seem to tune it out. My request probably irritates him because he thinks I'm  acting a princess and should get over it. I feel like he could me more considerate and on board to figure something out for both of us, but he really won't even entertain it. I really don't know how to get through to him.   \n",

       "4   I've been with this guy for about 10 months, he is super busy all of the time with multiple businesses. He is always on the phone or physically working. Which working for a living is great but it's overkill. During covid, his ex took him to court for custody stuff and it really stressed him out. They finally had the final hearing and all of it supposed to be done with. I've mentioned several times that we really don't see each other anymore, barely talk on the phone and I'm getting bitter about it. I try to tell him how I feel and he gets aggravated because he doesn't want to talk about that. I was really upset this weekend because he chose not to hang out and go work on a house he is fixing for his friend. I expected at least one day. I was really upset and talked to him about it and after about 45 minutes, he said okay I think 45 minutes is enough time to talk. ð¤·ð»ââï¸ he tells me he loves me and has thought about us living Together. But he doesn't act that way. It hurt me so bad. I get my feelings hurt easily so that's why I'm trying to get feedback. I feel like I can't talk to him about anything, that I'm always a bother and I'm asking him to do things he clearly doesn't want to do. He says he doesn't want to break up and that things are fine with him . But I'm kinda miserable because he seems like a part time boyfriend. I keep hoping he will do things differently but it's not happening. My friends keep telling me to wait and give him more time. I've cried tonight just thinking about letting him go because only one of us is getting what we want essentially.  I feel really comfy with him and when we are together, it's great. But I look a lot towards the future and I don't see him wanting anything like that. Any ideas or help on what I should do or am I being over emotional?   \n",

She went to his house and saw a knife under his bed. He was living alone in this apartment. She knew it was for his safety and protection but she said the dude was joking around âYou know Iâm a dangerous guy. I can kill youâ. He put away the knife back in the kitchen. They had a good night. She said she was really having fun with him. The only thing was whenever she said sheâll go home, the dude would sit on her lap. Heâs really heavy she said so she couldnât go anywhere. \\n\\nI adviced my bestfriend if the dude still have a some âmehâ traits on the next few dates. I think she should stop seeing her just give him another chance cause I could see she had fun with that guy. I donât want to discouraged her. \\n\\nShe said she was kind scared with his âkill youâ joke but she would still continue seeing him thatâs why I said gave it another chance. Did I really do the right thing?   \n",

Iâve always wanted a NYE wedding and because of covid we decided next year is too soon and weâre going to wait until 2022. \\n\\nMy health insurance sucks though and Iâm on a medicine that isnât even covered so in total I spend over $600 a month on the insurance and medicine. If I were on his insurance it would be about $175 a month for the insurance and medicine. And it would include vision and dental which I donât currently have. \\n\\nMy parents are aware of the idea and are completely on board with it. The idea has also been brought up to his parents and they did not seem to have a problem with it. Everyone knows that would we save so much money by doing so and that there are a lot of other things that the money could be spent on.  I should also mention that the other benefit of getting married is that I deeply love this man and am thankful everyday that heâs with me. It isnât just about the health insurance! \\n\\nWhat weâre unsure about is if we should have a small ceremony and include our immediate family? Or if we just go down to the courthouse and not tell anyone? We donât want to make a huge deal about it and have it take away from the wedding with all of our loved ones in 2022. I know itâs just a piece of paper but I do feel like it has a lot of significance behind and I donât want to regret how we go about it.\\n\\nHas anyone done this and/or have any advice?   \n",

I can't seem to tune it out. My request probably irritates him because he thinks I'm  acting a princess and should get over it.

Which working for a living is great but it's overkill. During covid, his ex took him to court for custody stuff and it really stressed him out. They finally had the final hearing and all of it supposed to be done with. I've mentioned several times that we really don't see each other anymore, barely talk on the phone and I'm getting bitter about it. I try to tell him how I feel and he gets aggravated because he doesn't want to talk about that. I was really upset this weekend because he chose not to hang out and go work on a house he is fixing for his friend. I expected at least one day. I was really upset and talked to him about it and after about 45 minutes, he said okay I think 45 minutes is enough time to talk. ð¤·ð»ââï¸ he tells me he loves me and has thought about us living Together. But he doesn't act that way. It hurt me so bad. I get my feelings hurt easily so that's why I'm trying to get feedback. I feel like I can't talk to him about anything, that I'm always a bother and I'm asking him to do things he clearly doesn't want to do. He says he doesn't want to break up and that things are fine with him . But I'm kinda miserable because he seems like a part time boyfriend. I keep hoping he will do things differently but it's not happening. My friends keep telling me to wait and give him more time. I've cried tonight just thinking about letting him go because only one of us is getting what we want essentially.  I feel really comfy with him and when we are together, it's great. But I look a lot towards the future and I don't see him wanting anything like that. Any ideas or help on what I should do or am I being over emotional?</td>\n",

The idea has also been brought up to his parents and they did not seem to have a problem with it. Everyone knows that would we save so much money by doing so and that there are a lot of other things that the money could be spent on.  I should also mention that the other benefit of getting married is that I deeply love this man and am thankful everyday that heâs with me. It isnât just about the health insurance! \\n\\nWhat weâre unsure about is if we should have a small ceremony and include our immediate family? Or if we just go down to the courthouse and not tell anyone? We donât want to make a huge deal about it and have it take away from the wedding with all of our loved ones in 2022. I know itâs just a piece of paper but I do feel like it has a lot of significance behind and I donât want to regret how we go about it.\\n\\nHas anyone done this and/or have any advice?</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hi all! I have been talking with girl for quite awhile now, but havenât been on an official date yet. We matched online and we started talking, we exchanged phone numbers, social media accounts etc. I have talked to her over the phone multiple times and for hours. I have enjoyed talking to her and I think she does too. I can tell she has a strong personality and doesnât want to reveal herself. I have actually asked her out couple times, but something came up each time. One time she was out of town, another time she was over to her friendâs house. She didnât lie to me cause I have her Instagram account and I can confirm that in both cases she was telling the truth. Actually there was another time that I asked her out, and that time she told me that she had problems with her car, so I offered myself to go pick her up, but she didnât reply to me that day so I assumed she didnât want to.\\n\\nAt this point I started to ignore her.. but she always came back to me. She watches every single story I post on Instagram, and most of the time she replies too. I didnât talk to her for about ten days last time around, and boom she sent me a message saying that we should go out for an hike. I told her that I had to confirm to her since it was around the holidays ( New Years week) and donât know if I had time for that particular day. Once I got back to her and told her that I was actually free that day and I could go out with her, she saw the message and didnât reply tough... Couple days ago, once again she sees my story on Instagram and replies to me.. I donât know if she is that insecure or she likes to be chased or what. She also told me before this last episode that she hopes to see me in 2021... what do you do of her ? She likes me ? She is playing games ? She is just insecure ? To be honest if we were not in a pandemic, I probably donât think I would have waited all this time on her.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Long story short, wife (31f) and I (32m) have had a rocky relationship these past few months. We have a 1 year old son together and I moved out for a few months in September to be with my own family and try to collect myself. \\n\\nA lot of our issues are because of me and I'm just trying to figure out if this marriage is salvageable or not. I haven't been the best father or husband, I'm trying to do better for her and our son but she's having trouble with everything herself. \\n\\nFor the record, there has been no infidelity on either part, our issues are because we both have problems communicating and rather than talk about my own issues I would brush them under the rug and say I'm fine until I would hit my breaking point which is why I initially left. Also, before anything ever came of this relationship I lied about a lot of things because I don't like anyone knowing the truth about me. I came clean to her about everything after I left and am in therapy for it. Most of it pertains to my shitty childhood / teenage years. Anyways, she feels like she can't trust anything I say anymore and I get that. \\n\\nNow I'm back, initially it was only supposed to be for the holidays but now she's asked me to stay and help co-parent which I've been doing. She also doesn't want me to sleep on the couch but in our bed together. Sometimes she wants to cuddle, other times she is very cold towards me. \\n\\nMoving forward she says that we are getting a divorce but other times she'll talk about the future as though we're still together and different things she'd like for us to do as a family. Some days she hates me and I'm getting a lot of mixed signals and it feels like I'm walking on egg shells 90% of the time. \\n\\nSo reddit, what should I do?\\nPersonally, I would like to save the marriage, I do love her and our son dearly.

She hates her self for no apparent reason. All of these negative thoughts have made her have severe brain fog and also be unable to focus on herself, her studies in which she is suffering badly and socially (as she has no other friends other than me) and is eventually making the suicidal and self harm thoughts even worse. A lot of times she does not share these thoughts with me or does at a later point in time for which initially I would get offended and act out, but now I thank her for sharing it with me. I have spent hours and hours talking to her and making her realize her self worth, plan her school out and also seek the medical help she needs (therapy, anxiety pills etc). Currently I am pushing her through a therapist, however each day she seems to hate herself more and more. We both do have our own rooms so she ends up going to hers and just being there the whole day, not eating and drinking unless forced to do so. I (22M) on the other hand am doing well with school or at least trying and suffer from severe anxiety for the past 5 years, however I have been on medications before but now I try to cope with it myself as I have somewhat become used to being anxious. Regardless, all of this has been taking a severe toll on my own mental health (Which is not a concern as long as she gets better). I also am scared to be with a person who can harm or kill themselves whenever whereas I expect to share my life with them. Is there something I can do better? What is my best course of action?\\n\\nThank you. \\n\\nI am sorry if I missed something, i will keep adding it as an edit.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I was talking to this girl who was really cool to me, she was extremely pretty to me and she just had an overall amazing personality to me. We went on a first date, we had a lot of fun and nothing happen, no hand holding or kissing but as she was leaving, she said something in the sense of âI would kiss you butâ and just left the car. Christmas comes around, she asks me to come up and spend the night at her place so I drove a few hours to come up and spend time with her. We spend the day with each other, it was really great and finally in bed, she kisses me the first time and I just melted. Later that night, I remember us making out and we ended up doing stuff together (never leading to sex) and I remember us at some point just turning around and going back to sleep. I wake up to her head on my chest and also to her hands down my pants trying to jerk me off. I woke up a bit confused but I wasnât offended, I just woke up kinda like âHaâ and laughed it off. She all of a sudden goes âWhy would you do that?â and Iâm like âDo what?â âTouch me in my sleepâ and at this point Iâm like âWhoa. Wtf no, we were kissing and you were moaning and never resisted, if you were to tell me at that point like âHey no Iâm okayâ I wouldâve def been like âOkay my badâ but you were kissing me and holding me, do you want me to leave? I didnât mean to make you feel uncomfortableâ and she says âNo, you can stayâ so I start feeling sick and start throwing up in her bathroom just from my anxiety. Itâs like 7 in the morning, so I awkwardly crawl back into bed trying to figure my feelings out and she puts her arms around me asking if Iâm okay and Iâm like âNo, youâre telling me I did this when I have a total different view of what happenedâ and she falls asleep with me. Iâm going home, she gives me a hug and goes âText me so I know you got home safe, feel better ð¥ºâ and so I drive back home. Sheâs giving her view on what happened and how she feels about the whole situation, at this point Iâm explaining on how I remember the situation happening and she goes âI jerked you off as retaliation and I donât remember kissing you but if I did then okayâ and Iâm like âOkayâ so during this time, sheâs acting normal with me but Iâm still very weary of this whole thing since Iâm not sure what weâre suppose to do. She ends up making these rude jokes about my appearance saying I look like her ex but a 12 year old version and just makes jokes about my overall personality. \\n\\nDuring this whole time, Iâm texting my friends confused on what to do since Iâve never been in a situation like that before. Iâm a huge hopeless romantic dude who doesnât get off hurting women so this really affected my personality and physical feeling for the next few days. I explain to her that this painting she has of me isnât right and itâs not my true character but I just remember the incident happening completely differently. I tell her like I think she would start over again since Iâm ngl I have a different view of her too since that started and she goes âI agreeâ so we end up talking on the phone, FaceTiming with each other, and everything felt back to normal. \\n\\nNot even 5 days later, sheâs still talking to me and explained that she feels like she canât trust me because of that night. Iâm over here trying to explain like I think it was miscommunication on both ends of what happened just because I feel like her lack of saying anything + her actions of âretaliationâ arenât very clear to me nor are they logical. December 31st comes by and she asks me to come over, Iâm a bit surprised but I have nothing else to do and Iâm thinking of ways to spend the day with her. The first maybe 30 minutes of us hanging out at her place were a bit off but it ended with her kissing me, letting me hold her, and us watching Pixarâs âSoulâ on her couch. We went to her bedroom, we watched shows, and we laid with each other just laughing the night away and just having an overall great night. Weâre painting too and she all of a sudden smacks my ass but I didnât really care lol she ends up laying on me and I just ask her âCan I kiss you?â and she says yes so we end up kissing for a minute but once again, it leads to nothing since Iâm cautious of that now. We fall asleep on her bed, I slept in my boxers and she slept in her stuff, we woke up around 8 and everything was totally cool. I gave her a kiss on the cheek and told her how cool she was, she smiled and giggled, she gave me a big hug back and played w my hair. So I pack up my stuff, give her a kiss on the cheek (she didnât brush her teeth so she didnât want to kiss me lol) and I drove back home. She told me to text her once I got home, I did and I was really proud of my our time together since it was such a success. \\n\\nShe ignored me for a few hours and Iâm like âeh, sheâs probably busy whateverâ and then she texts me saying that this wonât work because I donât give her space + she isnât happy with us + she makes jokes about me as a wall + she canât get over the first night + doesnât enjoy time with me, she just leaves it at that. I feel like my time was completely wasted and Iâm a bit mad that I spent New Years Eve with someone who invited me over but apparently didnât want me there? We ate dinner together, laughing, painting, holding each other, and just having a great time overall but all of a sudden, itâs taken a completely different turn.

Together a long time. \\nIt seems like every night we have the same argument.\\nFor example right now I'm in the living room, trying to watch tv. He is in the bedroom playing video games with friends.  \\nliving room and bedroom are far enough from each other that if someone watches TV you can't hear it in the bedroom.\\nProblem is, he speaks so loudly that I can hear his every last word and exclamation. He also insists on wearing over the ear headphones that exacerbates the problem - in them he doesn't hear how loud he is. (but he's very loud even without the headphones).\\nWhen I ask him to keep it down because it's irritating and I can\"t enjoy my show, he says to get over it.\\nI have tried to not mind it but it drives me crazy, it's like forcing me to pay attention to two things at once. I can't seem to tune it out. My request probably irritates him because he thinks I'm  acting a princess and should get over it. I feel like he could me more considerate and on board to figure something out for both of us, but he really won't even entertain it. I really don't know how to get through to him.   \n",

He is always on the phone or physically working. Which working for a living is great but it's overkill. During covid, his ex took him to court for custody stuff and it really stressed him out. They finally had the final hearing and all of it supposed to be done with. I've mentioned several times that we really don't see each other anymore, barely talk on the phone and I'm getting bitter about it. I try to tell him how I feel and he gets aggravated because he doesn't want to talk about that. I was really upset this weekend because he chose not to hang out and go work on a house he is fixing for his friend. I expected at least one day. I was really upset and talked to him about it and after about 45 minutes, he said okay I think 45 minutes is enough time to talk. ð¤·ð»ââï¸ he tells me he loves me and has thought about us living Together. But he doesn't act that way. It hurt me so bad. I get my feelings hurt easily so that's why I'm trying to get feedback. I feel like I can't talk to him about anything, that I'm always a bother and I'm asking him to do things he clearly doesn't want to do. He says he doesn't want to break up and that things are fine with him . But I'm kinda miserable because he seems like a part time boyfriend. I keep hoping he will do things differently but it's not happening. My friends keep telling me to wait and give him more time. I've cried tonight just thinking about letting him go because only one of us is getting what we want essentially.  I feel really comfy with him and when we are together, it's great. But I look a lot towards the future and I don't see him wanting anything like that. Any ideas or help on what I should do or am I being over emotional?   \n",

She went to his house and saw a knife under his bed. He was living alone in this apartment. She knew it was for his safety and protection but she said the dude was joking around âYou know Iâm a dangerous guy. I can kill youâ. He put away the knife back in the kitchen. They had a good night. She said she was really having fun with him. The only thing was whenever she said sheâll go home, the dude would sit on her lap. Heâs really heavy she said so she couldnât go anywhere. \\n\\nI adviced my bestfriend if the dude still have a some âmehâ traits on the next few dates. I think she should stop seeing her just give him another chance cause I could see she had fun with that guy. I donât want to discouraged her. \\n\\nShe said she was kind scared with his âkill youâ joke but she would still continue seeing him thatâs why I said gave it another chance. Did I really do the right thing?   \n",

sandwich is just cheese and bread. Not cheese and ham, not cheese and chicken, not cheese and turkey, not cheese and veggies. Once you add something other than cheese itâs called a MELT. A turkey and cheese melt, a ham and cheese melt, etc.   \n",

Iâve always wanted a NYE wedding and because of covid we decided next year is too soon and weâre going to wait until 2022. \\n\\nMy health insurance sucks though and Iâm on a medicine that isnât even covered so in total I spend over $600 a month on the insurance and medicine. If I were on his insurance it would be about $175 a month for the insurance and medicine. And it would include vision and dental which I donât currently have. \\n\\nMy parents are aware of the idea and are completely on board with it. The idea has also been brought up to his parents and they did not seem to have a problem with it. Everyone knows that would we save so much money by doing so and that there are a lot of other things that the money could be spent on.  I should also mention that the other benefit of getting married is that I deeply love this man and am thankful everyday that heâs with me. It isnât just about the health insurance! \\n\\nWhat weâre unsure about is if we should have a small ceremony and include our immediate family? Or if we just go down to the courthouse and not tell anyone? We donât want to make a huge deal about it and have it take away from the wedding with all of our loved ones in 2022. I know itâs just a piece of paper but I do feel like it has a lot of significance behind and I donât want to regret how we go about it.\\n\\nHas anyone done this and/or have any advice?   \n",

taste of their beverage is better than the literal thousands of better tasting options available to them. They will also ridicule the people who like to drink their beverage with some additive that makes it not taste like a butthole.   \n",

I have been talking with girl for quite awhile now, but havenât been on an official date yet. We matched online and we started talking, we exchanged phone numbers, social media accounts etc. I have talked to her over the phone multiple times and for hours. I have enjoyed talking to her and I think she does too. I can tell she has a strong personality and doesnât want to reveal herself. I have actually asked her out couple times, but something came up each time. One time she was out of town, another time she was over to her friendâs house. She didnât lie to me cause I have her Instagram account and I can confirm that in both cases she was telling the truth. Actually there was another time that I asked her out, and that time she told me that she had problems with her car, so I offered myself to go pick her up, but she didnât reply to me that day so I assumed she didnât want to.\\n\\nAt this point I started to ignore her.. but she always came back to me. She watches every single story I post on Instagram, and most of the time she replies too. I didnât talk to her for about ten days last time around, and boom she sent me a message saying that we should go out for an hike. I told her that I had to confirm to her since it was around the holidays ( New Years week) and donât know if I had time for that particular day. Once I got back to her and told her that I was actually free that day and I could go out with her, she saw the message and didnât reply tough... Couple days ago, once again she sees my story on Instagram and replies to me.. I donât know if she is that insecure or she likes to be chased or what. She also told me before this last episode that she hopes to see me in 2021... what do you do of her ? She likes me ? She is playing games ? She is just insecure ? To be honest if we were not in a pandemic, I probably donât think I would have waited all this time on her.   \n",

Basic needs feels impossible to achieve. Maybe I'm just lazy, or maybe I'm just depressed...but man I'm lucky to live with family, but still I hate being stuck with no indepence. I wish I could just be free with my own car, house, money, etc. Don't get wrong, i work only two days a week early mornings, and I love it!\\n\\nbut I dread full-time work! Seriously where does it end!? ....And just trying to make a career is tiresome. It's funny how we're trapped in this boring endless dystopia where everything is just grey, boring....how can anyone like this!?   \n",

I currently work at a small firm, but my current boss became a good friend and mentored me in the industry for the past 2 years. I look up to this guy like a professional father figure. \\n\\nWe are a small firm, and I have a ton of responsibility. I even pushed back the start date until mid February so I can continue to train the person who I anticipate will take my role. \\n\\nI fee horrible, but it is legitimately my dream job and they are also doubling my pay. I donât really know what Iâm asking for - but maybe some advice from someone who was at some time in a similar position?\\n\\nThank you guys.\\n\\nEdit: I apologize I should have been more clear - my current boss is the majority owner of the firm!\\n\\nHi Guys - I just woke up and saw a ton of responses! I just wanted to say thank you very much! Each person had great advice and I will give an update tomorrow night when I speak with him!   \n",

             Take my friend for example. I've seen him smile after laughing at a joke or smirk when he sees something he likes, but then in all his pictures, his smile looks like he just kinda opened his lips but clenched his teeth.   \n",

We have a 1 year old son together and I moved out for a few months in September to be with my own family and try to collect myself. \\n\\nA lot of our issues are because of me and I'm just trying to figure out if this marriage is salvageable or not. I haven't been the best father or husband, I'm trying to do better for her and our son but she's having trouble with everything herself. \\n\\nFor the record, there has been no infidelity on either part, our issues are because we both have problems communicating and rather than talk about my own issues I would brush them under the rug and say I'm fine until I would hit my breaking point which is why I initially left. Also, before anything ever came of this relationship I lied about a lot of things because I don't like anyone knowing the truth about me. I came clean to her about everything after I left and am in therapy for it. Most of it pertains to my shitty childhood / teenage years. Anyways, she feels like she can't trust anything I say anymore and I get that. \\n\\nNow I'm back, initially it was only supposed to be for the holidays but now she's asked me to stay and help co-parent which I've been doing. She also doesn't want me to sleep on the couch but in our bed together. Sometimes she wants to cuddle, other times she is very cold towards me. \\n\\nMoving forward she says that we are getting a divorce but other times she'll talk about the future as though we're still together and different things she'd like for us to do as a family. Some days she hates me and I'm getting a lot of mixed signals and it feels like I'm walking on egg shells 90% of the time. \\n\\nSo reddit, what should I do?\\nPersonally, I would like to save the marriage, I do love her and our son dearly.

started looking around for bank loans to start a workers co-op's. In my country, Sweden, there's a state finance thingy called Almi that gives loans to people wanting to start businesses. I want the co-op because the workers should reap the benefits, not shareholders, and only work MAX 6 hrs a day.\\n\\nWhat is the equivalent in your country in terms of loan institutions?\\n\\nSpread the info so people can get out of the endless job cycle   \n",

I've tried, I found it insipid), I do know who he is because I also train BJJ. I just came across this post &lt;&lt;https://www.reddit.com/r/thefighterandthekid/comments/kndal6/is_the_jre_empire_now_just_a_slowly_crumbling/ghjy4rn/&gt;&gt;, and I have no idea what /r/joerogan2 is or what the OP meant about being \"*made homeless when Rogan's copyright goons tore down my home at /r/joerogan2*\". Can someone give me a short synopsis?   \n",

We both started seeing each other in university. Later on we ended up moving in together. My GF (21F) is depressive, anxious and suicidal. She hates her self for no apparent reason. All of these negative thoughts have made her have severe brain fog and also be unable to focus on herself, her studies in which she is suffering badly and socially (as she has no other friends other than me) and is eventually making the suicidal and self harm thoughts even worse. A lot of times she does not share these thoughts with me or does at a later point in time for which initially I would get offended and act out, but now I thank her for sharing it with me. I have spent hours and hours talking to her and making her realize her self worth, plan her school out and also seek the medical help she needs (therapy, anxiety pills etc). Currently I am pushing her through a therapist, however each day she seems to hate herself more and more. We both do have our own rooms so she ends up going to hers and just being there the whole day, not eating and drinking unless forced to do so. I (22M) on the other hand am doing well with school or at least trying and suffer from severe anxiety for the past 5 years, however I have been on medications before but now I try to cope with it myself as I have somewhat become used to being anxious. Regardless, all of this has been taking a severe toll on my own mental health (Which is not a concern as long as she gets better). I also am scared to be with a person who can harm or kill themselves whenever whereas I expect to share my life with them. Is there something I can do better? What is my best course of action?\\n\\nThank you. \\n\\nI am sorry if I missed something, i will keep adding it as an edit.   \n",
       "18  I was talking to this girl who was really cool to me, she was extremely pretty to me and she just had an overall amazing personality to me. We went on a first date, we had a lot of fun and nothing happen, no hand holding or kissing but as she was leaving, she said something in the sense of âI would kiss you butâ and just left the car. Christmas comes around, she asks me to come up and spend the night at her place so I drove a few hours to come up and spend time with her. We spend the day with each other, it was really great and finally in bed, she kisses me the first time and I just melted. Later that night, I remember us making out and we ended up doing stuff together (never leading to sex) and I remember us at some point just turning around and going back to sleep. I wake up to her head on my chest and also to her hands down my pants trying to jerk me off. I woke up a bit confused but I wasnât offended, I just woke up kinda like âHaâ and laughed it off. She all of a sudden goes âWhy would you do that?â and Iâm like âDo what?â âTouch me in my sleepâ and at this point Iâm like âWhoa. Wtf no, we were kissing and you were moaning and never resisted, if you were to tell me at that point like âHey no Iâm okayâ I wouldâve def been like âOkay my badâ but you were kissing me and holding me, do you want me to leave? I didnât mean to make you feel uncomfortableâ and she says âNo, you can stayâ so I start feeling sick and start throwing up in her bathroom just from my anxiety. Itâs like 7 in the morning, so I awkwardly crawl back into bed trying to figure my feelings out and she puts her arms around me asking if Iâm okay and Iâm like âNo, youâre telling me I did this when I have a total different view of what happenedâ and she falls asleep with me. Iâm going home, she gives me a hug and goes âText me so I know you got home safe, feel better ð¥ºâ and so I drive back home. Sheâs giving her view on what happened and how she feels about the whole situation, at this point Iâm explaining on how I remember the situation happening and she goes âI jerked you off as retaliation and I donât remember kissing you but if I did then okayâ and Iâm like âOkayâ so during this time, sheâs acting normal with me but Iâm still very weary of this whole thing since Iâm not sure what weâre suppose to do. She ends up making these rude jokes about my appearance saying I look like her ex but a 12 year old version and just makes jokes about my overall personality. \\n\\nDuring this whole time, Iâm texting my friends confused on what to do since Iâve never been in a situation like that before. Iâm a huge hopeless romantic dude who doesnât get off hurting women so this really affected my personality and physical feeling for the next few days. I explain to her that this painting she has of me isnât right and itâs not my true character but I just remember the incident happening completely differently. I tell her like I think she would start over again since Iâm ngl I have a different view of her too since that started and she goes âI agreeâ so we end up talking on the phone, FaceTiming with each other, and everything felt back to normal. \\n\\nNot even 5 days later, sheâs still talking to me and explained that she feels like she canât trust me because of that night. Iâm over here trying to explain like I think it was miscommunication on both ends of what happened just because I feel like her lack of saying anything + her actions of âretaliationâ arenât very clear to me nor are they logical. December 31st comes by and she asks me to come over, Iâm a bit surprised but I have nothing else to do and Iâm thinking of ways to spend the day with her. The first maybe 30 minutes of us hanging out at her place were a bit off but it ended with her kissing me, letting me hold her, and us watching Pixarâs âSoulâ on her couch. We went to her bedroom, we watched shows, and we laid with each other just laughing the night away and just having an overall great night. Weâre painting too and she all of a sudden smacks my ass but I didnât really care lol she ends up laying on me and I just ask her âCan I kiss you?â and she says yes so we end up kissing for a minute but once again, it leads to nothing since Iâm cautious of that now. We fall asleep on her bed, I slept in my boxers and she slept in her stuff, we woke up around 8 and everything was totally cool. I gave her a kiss on the cheek and told her how cool she was, she smiled and giggled, she gave me a big hug back and played w my hair. So I pack up my stuff, give her a kiss on the cheek (she didnât brush her teeth so she didnât want to kiss me lol) and I drove back home. She told me to text her once I got home, I did and I was really proud of my our time together since it was such a success. \\n\\nShe ignored me for a few hours and Iâm like âeh, sheâs probably busy whateverâ and then she texts me saying that this wonât work because I donât give her space + she isnât happy with us + she makes jokes about me as a wall + she canât get over the first night + doesnât enjoy time with me, she just leaves it at that. I feel like my time was completely wasted and Iâm a bit mad that I spent New Years Eve with someone who invited me over but apparently didnât want me there? We ate dinner together, laughing, painting, holding each other, and just having a great time overall but all of a sudden, itâs taken a completely different turn. Do I have the right to feel a bit used?   \n",

We have so much in common and hes such an easy going guy hes so sweet to me and he hes the one who trained me when i first got this job. We texted each other everyday and talked about how are day went . my boyfriend was starting to get suspicious one day and i told him im just talking to a friend . so  my co-worker asked me out to dinner. He took me to a nice restraunt we had a good time . we left around 1am he took me to his place and we watched a movie . it was really cold and i was getting tired so i leaned on his shoulder and next thing you know i felasleep i wokeup in the morning and he took me home . i got home and slept some more .\\nAs soon as i wokeup my boyfriend starts asking me where ive been all night . and i told him i was out with a friend he says i know you were i saw your text messages with your co worker. Then he grabbed my neck and slapped me across my face 3-5 times . i kicked him off me and ran to the restroom and locked the door . then he broke the door down ! Pinned me on the ground and was sitting on top of me i felt like i couldn't breath . he demanded me to tell him everything me and my co worker did when we went out so i did . then he left . i was in so much shock and afraid to leave the house so i just stayed home and went back to bed . my boyfriend came back home a few hours later and he was apologizing saying he didnt know what got into him that he lost his temper. then we had sex because he initiated it and i didnt know what else to do i feel like this is all my fault . i feel i did this to myself . im lost for words.\\n\\n(22f) (28m)   \n",

That was the last straw for me and I stormed into the manager's office and complained. He was suspended and then they did this big investigation and I had to testify about it and everything.\\n\\nI felt really uncomfortable that my complaint led to that. I felt sort of guilty and also I was worried that he would kill me or something. It turned out fine for me, but I probably wouldn't have reported it had I known.   \n",
