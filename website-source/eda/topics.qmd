The questions we will address in this work are:

**Idea 1**

`Business goal`: Given a textual post, classify the subreddit to which it belongs.
`Technical approach`: Use NLP techniques to construct a feature set from the textual components of a post. These features may be word “dummy variables” (the existence or non-existence of a word), word counts, n-grams (sequences of `n` words), or other types of features. Use the newly created features to build a multi-class classification model capable of classifying the subreddit to which a post belongs.

**Idea 2**

`Business goal`: Given a textual post, predict the age and gender of the author of the post.
`Technical approach`: Use NLP techniques to extract the age and gender of the author of a post, if available (as an example: “My brother (24M) and I (23M) went to the store…”). Use NLP techniques to construct a feature set from the textual components of a post. Again, these features may be word “dummy variables” (the existence or non-existence of a word), word counts, n-grams (sequences of `n` words), or other types of features. Use the newly created features to build two models: a regression model for predicting the age of the author of the post, and a classification model for classifying the gender of the author of the post.

**Idea 3**

`Business goal`: Use a pre-trained model to build features surrounding NLP for our ML tasks.
`Technical approach`: Identify available pre-trained models in the realm of NLP and what they are trained to extract from textual data. Use a pre-trained model, or models, to perform NLP tasks for downstream tasks. For instance, use a pre-trained model to obtain word embeddings (vector representations of words) that can be used as features in a subsequent ML model.
