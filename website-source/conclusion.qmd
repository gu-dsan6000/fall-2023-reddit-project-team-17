# Conclusion

By analyzing a vast collection of storytelling subreddits, which can again be seen above in @fig-subreddit-banner, we were able to extract rich information that gave us a better understanding of the details and characteristics of posts on Reddit. In doing so, we explored several different avenues related to storytelling on Reddit, providing us with a well-rounded understanding of textual content and other features of Reddit posts.

First, we sought to identify if storytelling language usage differs between communities. To do so, we attempted to classify a post as belonging to a particular subreddit, given only its textual content. We used frequency counts of the 500 most common words used across *all* posts as predictors to a multi-class classification model to classify posts as belonging to a single subreddit. Through this analysis, we found that using these frequency counts, based on the textual contents of a post alone, we could classify posts as belonging to the correct subreddit with success that outperformed na√Øve benchmark methods. However, with such variety regarding the number of posts made within each subreddit, we also found that it can be difficult to extract the unique features of posts belonging to subreddits that are less frequently used by Redditors.

Next, we performed a deep dive into the subreddit `r/AmItheA**hole`, focusing on the flairs assigned to each post. We focused on four "primary flairs," which were "Asshole," "Not the A-hole," "Everyone Sucks," and "No A-holes here," and performed exploratory analysis, natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and applied machine learning models. Through these analyses, we concluded that it is very difficult to accurately predict how Redditors will judge these stories according to these flairs. It is apparent that the overall manner in which Redditors judge one another may be more complex than the content of their posts only. Additionally, we found that the more positive the text of a post is, the more engagement it seemingly receives from other Reddit users, at least for this particular subreddit.

Furthermore, we prepared a dataset for training a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to generate stories. We combined high-scoring Reddit submissions with texts from classic literature like "The Scarlet Letter" and "The Odyssey." The Reddit data was carefully curated for quality, and we applied natural language processing techniques like tokenization to prepare both sources for analysis. We then built and trained an RNN model using tools like `PySpark`, `PyTorch`, and CUDA. We implemented procedures to set the hyperparameters for better model training and to avoid overfitting. Low loss and perplexity values indicated our model's strong predictive performance. Although the generated stories aren't entirely cohesive, the model successfully forms coherent words, demonstrating a grasp of basic linguistic structures and marking a significant step towards more complex story generation.

Finally, because one of the best ways to gain an understanding of a topic in a subreddit is to read the most popular comments, we wanted to reduce that workload as much as possible. To do this, we performed exploratory data analysis and natural language processing to identify our topics of interest. We then found an open-source model that could accurately summarize a comment to roughly a fourth of its previous size. This could greatly reduce the necessary time for someone to gain a strong understanding of the discourse happening related to a topic within a particular subreddit.

## Future Work

Having explored many different avenues regarding storytelling through Reddit, there are many opportunities for further improving our understanding of these posts.

Regarding subreddit community prediction, we would like to explore additional types of multi-class classification models capable of outperforming our existing models. Furthermore, to address the vast class imbalance in the dataset, we wish to employ sampling techniques that can allow us to gather a more representative and balanced dataset *without* the steep cost of downsampling to the least common class.

Further analysis related to the `r/AmItheA**hole` subreddit and how Redditors judge others could explore other types of models, predictors, and subreddits involving a similar dynamic between posters and responders. In particular, investigating other measures of user engagement could help broaded our understanding of the judgement present in this subreddit.

Furthermore, we could employ more advanced techniques for text generation, mainly focusing on transformer models. These have shown superior performance in generating more coherent and diverse text. While our RNN understood basic grammar structures, it fell short of generating the stories we were expecting. Transformers are better at handling long-range dependencies, making them ideal for complex tasks like story generation. By incorporating transformers, we anticipate a significant enhancement in the model's ability to create linguistically correct stories that are closer to human-like storytelling.

Finally, for our work in summarization, we could explore the option of fine-tuning a summarization model specifically on Reddit data for a specific subreddit. Additionally, one of the biggest challenges with this goal was its subjective nature and the need for human-generated reference summaries. Our workaround was to use the GPT-4 API to generate reference summaries, and this method could be used to create the data to fine-tune our model as well.

## Final Thoughts

Ultimately, we learned a lot about language usage across Reddit through our analyses on specific storytelling subreddit communities. We employed numerous analytical techniques, such as Big Data Processing, Exploratory Data Analysis, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning in order to broaded our understanding of language usage on Reddit. Finally, we gathered our analyses and thoughts into a well-documented website while offering both technical and non-technical insights throughout.
