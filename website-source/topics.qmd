# Topics

The questions we will address in this work are:

**Idea 1**

* `Business goal`: Given a textual post, classify the subreddit to which it belongs.
* `Technical approach`: Use NLP techniques to construct a feature set from the textual components of a post. These features may be word “dummy variables” (the existence or non-existence of a word), word counts, n-grams (sequences of `n` words), or other types of features. Use the newly created features to build a multi-class classification model capable of classifying the subreddit to which a post belongs.

**Idea 2**

* `Business goal`: Given a textual post, predict the age and gender of the author of the post.
* `Technical approach`: Use NLP techniques to extract the age and gender of the author of a post, if available (as an example: “My brother (24M) and I (23M) went to the store…”). Use NLP techniques to construct a feature set from the textual components of a post. Again, these features may be word “dummy variables” (the existence or non-existence of a word), word counts, n-grams (sequences of `n` words), or other types of features. Use the newly created features to build two models: a regression model for predicting the age of the author of the post, and a classification model for classifying the gender of the author of the post.

**Idea 3**

* `Business goal`: Use a pre-trained model to build features surrounding NLP for our ML tasks.
* `Technical approach`: Identify available pre-trained models in the realm of NLP and what they are trained to extract from textual data. Use a pre-trained model, or models, to perform NLP tasks for downstream tasks. For instance, use a pre-trained model to obtain word embeddings (vector representations of words) that can be used as features in a subsequent ML model.

**Idea 4**

* `Business goal`: Predict the popularity of text-based submissions based on their text content.
* `Technical approach`: Using NLP techniques on the text posts of various similarly sized subreddits (by number of subscribers) that typically contain posts with moderate to high word counts, extract the most pertinent features. Apply supervised machine learning models (e.g., regression) to predict the number of upvotes and/or comments a given text post will receive. Identify the most influential/important words and phrases that predict a post’s popularity and calculate accuracy metrics based on actual post popularity.

**Idea 5**

* `Business goal`: Determine/predict “flairs” of Reddit posts in r/AITA based on their text content.
* `Technical approach`: Focusing primarily on the subreddit r/AITA and its flairs (Asshole, Not the A-hole, Everyone Sucks, No A-holes here), apply NLP techniques such as tokenization on text-based submissions to extract the important contents of each post. Apply a multi-class classification model trained on labelled r/AITA posts (i.e., text posts with a flair) to predict which flair a given post will receive based on its text content. Present confusion matrices on testing dataset and identify the words/phrases most commonly associated with each flair type.

**Idea 6**

* `Business goal`: Determine which subreddit posts belong to based on their sentiment.
* `Technical approach`: Use NLP techniques to clean content of various text based subreddits. Apply sentiment modeling to these posts. Train a classification model on these posts. Assess accuracy of the model using unlabelled posts (i.e., posts where the subreddit is not identified). Present findings in confusion matrices and calculate various accuracy metrics.



**Idea 7**

* `Business goal`: Evaluate the relationship between the number of comments and the score of Reddit posts to establish an 'interaction_score' as an aggregate engagement metric.
* `Technical approach`: We plan to analyze the relationship between the number of comments and post scores on social media platforms. This involves collecting data grouped by subreddits or similar categories and using `pyspark.sql.functions` to calculate the correlation between these two metrics. We will develop an `interaction_score` metric based on our findings, averaging the number of comments and post scores. This new metric aims to provide a unified measure of user engagement across various posts and platforms.



**Idea 8**

* `Business goal`: Assess the impact of not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content on user engagement.
* `Technical approach`: To analyze the influence of NSFW content on user engagement, we will utilize a dataset of submissions, focusing on those marked with the `over_18` flag. Considering the limited proportion of such posts, we'll create a balanced dataset by randomly selecting an equivalent number of submissions without the NSFW tag. This approach ensures a fair comparison between NSFW and non-NSFW content. We will employ the `interaction_score` from Topic 1 as a primary measure of user engagement. Our methodology includes generating a boxplot to visualize the distribution of interaction scores for both NSFW and non-NSFW posts. 



**Idea 9**

* `Business goal`: Identify the times of the day when posts typically receive the most engagement.

* `Technical approach`: Implement a data analysis process that focuses on understanding the temporal patterns of user engagement on social media posts. Utilize the `created_utc` column from the dataset to create two new variables: `week_of_the_year` and `hour_of_the_day`. Exclude the first two days of 2022 to maintain accurate weekly categorization, as these days are part of week 53 of 2021. Aggregate and analyze the data based on these new variables to reveal patterns in user engagement across different times of the day and weeks of the year. The outcome will be visualized through a comprehensive plot, illustrating the times when posts receive the most engagement, thus guiding content strategies for optimal post timing.





**Idea 10**

* `Business goal`: Is there any correlation between engagement and how controversial a comment is?
* `Technical approach`: Use NLP to determine if a controversial comment is more likely to correlate with different engagement metrics. 

**Idea 11**

* `Business goal`: Identify whether current events are shown in different subreddits and their level of engagement.
* `Technical approach`: Use NLP to identify current events in different subreddits and their level of engagement. 

**Idea 12**

* `Business goal`: Summarise a reddit comment.
* `Technical approach`: Use a pretrained machine learning model to summarize the contents within a comment.
