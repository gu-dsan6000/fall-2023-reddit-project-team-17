# Overview

In this project, we dive into the intersection of story telling in Reddit and machine learning (ML). Our exploration spans various aspects from classifying posts into specific subreddits to predicting the age and gender of posters based on their language. We're also examining the influence of NSFW posts on user engagement and the correlation between post score and its comments. The project will utilize advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to unearth trends within communities, predict post flairs, and delve into the sentiment analysis of subreddit posts. We also aim to use ML to distill meaningful insights from vast quantities of data.
