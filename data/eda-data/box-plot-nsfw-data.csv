I found out my (19F) boyfriend (20M) cheated on me a month ago and we both agreed to patch it up and move on with our relationship. It's our last time attempting to have a healthy adult relationship. We've been dating since 8th year of midle school. 

I can't stop my thoughts from going to far. I go through his phone extensively. I sometimes find some nudies I've never seen and ask him every time:

""Why do you have these?""

He just says they were for me, but never sent them to me. I don't know what to do. I know the best thing is to break it off, but we've been together for 4-6 years. It's really difficult doing this to myself and I absolutely despise it. I hate confronting him after everything I find and him asking me if im trying to find something. No, I just wanna make sure you're not still going down there.

I might be underestimating him for really trying since then, but Idk.

Me and her got into it one night some months back over me not wanting her to hang out with a specific group of people as the guys in the group have been accused of sexual misconduct. Fast forward to today, she text me and tells me that she need to make a confession during that some months ago she got intoxicated and slept with one of the guys there and the only reason she’s telling me is because he’s had a chlamydia infection since then that was never treated. She says they wore protection but I can’t really take anything she says serious anymore. I went to get tested and awaiting results but I received treatment for it. My issues is now she’s trying to find ways to justify her sexual encounter and has tossed things my way by saying “well we just talking” or “he made me feel wanted something you weren’t doing” mind you i travel a lot so every chance I had to talk to her and tell her how much she meant to me I did. Her saying those things has made me doubt myself and thinking maybe she was justified knowing deep down inside it wasn’t. She gone to say that I was a complete waste of time and piece of shit but later days stuff along the lines of “I really wanted it to be us we were a team” or “I was so obsessed with you I loved you so much all I could do was think about you”

My husband and I share a PC, and when I logged on to use it, I saw that the most recent browser was porn, and was logged into his Pornhub account. No big, but I checked his saved videos to get an idea what he was watching to see if it’s anything fun to add a little spice to our sex life. More than half of the videos were of gay porn. 
I’m openly bisexual, so this does not bother me. I did bring it up to my husband, asking him why he’s never told me that he likes watching gay porn. He immediately broke down in tears, saying that he was so ashamed and he doesn’t know why he watches it. I assured him that it was okay and it isn’t anything to be ashamed over, but I asked if he ever thought he might be bisexual or even gay. He said no, he has no desire to physically be with a man but he just enjoys watching gay porn sometimes.
I have a horrible fear that I cannot stop thinking about, that he’s not being honest with himself or with me, and one day he’s going to wake up, realize that he’s gay and I’m going to hate myself for not pushing him to explore his potential sexuality.

2022-02-25 06:20:10,25,True,0,"Sooooo this FU just happened 30 minutes ago and I feel dirty and like a loser. So naturally, I made a throwaway because I want to warn other young men. Obligatory ""I'm on mobile so please forgive my formatting and grammar/spelling""


I'm (M22) traveling to Vegas with a stag party, but we aren't the typical party. We like to drink and have fun, but a few of us are Christian and in relationships (myself and the groom (duh) included). Because of this, it was agreed upon that we wouldn't have strippers on the groom's itinerary. We did start a game to collect the most calling cards on the strip to see who could get the most (with duplicates among the group disqualified) in one night, but that was as dirty as our activities got. This lead to the FU though...


Now I have all these cards in my room, getting me kind of horny. As a result, I fell to temptation and decided ""why not covertly order some adult entertainment to my room and I can at least feel some big tiddies for the first (and probably only) time in my life."" So I did some research, knowing the calling cards are a scam, and found a website that I thought would work. I settled on a stripper since I barely have the funds to cover the $150 charge. I had an additional $50 for the tips because my research didn't uncover that the full $150 would go to the company... I felt like an idiot when this was revealed later. I was told $150 for her for up to an hour.


She arrives, starts with some pleasantries, and can already tell I'm nervous. This is my first time doing this, so she explains a little. This is where I find out that she has a minimum ""tip"" of $300 to make me cum... and this is just for a handjob. I had to go to the ATM while she waited in my room, but I was able to afford to lose that extra cash. She tells me to turn down the lights and get naked... This should have been a red flag but I was horny and wanted to feel some big tits. I take everything off and lay on the bed while she pulls her pants down a little and pulls her boobs out while prepping the condom.


I lasted 2 fucking minutes tops... She left right after with ""sorry it didn't last very long."" I'm out $450 for a one or two minute hand job. At least I could feel her up and got a little bit of smother action, but now I feel lame. Not to mention, as I've stated, I have a girlfriend I really love. I got caught up in temptation and decided to just have one lap dance, hold a tit, and be done, but now I feel like utter scum and like I don't deserve her love or any chance of marriage in the future.


I don't know what to do. Part of me wants to never tell my girlfriend and carry the secret to my grave. Another part of me knows I should tell her and beg for her forgiveness. I feel like I should tell her before it's too late or it'll eat me up inside and I'll never have her trust again when it does come out. On the other hand, I don't want to make her feel horrible and break her heart if nobody ever has to know... I just feel like garbage because how could I do this to her, but say I love her every day?


Fellas, boobs aren't even that great to make up for the shame of it all. Please learn from me, Las Vegas strippers are a fucking scam. Don't fall to that temptation like I did or you will not only be a scummy loser, but a scummy loser short $500 dollars (or more if you let her talk you into pulling more). Much more importantly, if you love someone don't be anything but faithful. Even if she isn't packing a big rack and you're talking marriage, don't use that as an excuse to try out a busty stripper ""just to have the experience"". It ain't. Fucking. Worth it.


TL;DR: TIFU by falling for the Vegas girls to your room scam, $150 turned into $450, and I came after 1-2 fucking minutes into a handjob. All this just to feel a tit but now I feel like trash because I couldn't last and I have a girlfriend whom I deeply love. I don't know what to do about that... Feeling huge breasts doesn't even make up for it at all...",tifu,TIFU by ordering some classic Las Vegas Entertainment to my hotel room,12.5,2022-02-25
2022-03-12 23:14:11,10,True,1,"So this happened a few years ago and I still don't know where to land on it and I haven't informed anyone of this. 

It was the start of one of the most toxic relationships I've been in and I'm using that term loosely. Literally the first date that should have been the last.  


I'd met this bloke a year previous at a friends birthday party and they showed quite a bit of interest. Hind sight is 20/20 and there were red flags that had I been aware of them than I never would have reached out to this dude later. Anyways roughly a year later I get a social media suggestion to follow them and I do. We start exchanging likes and such via social media and engagement increases to the point where we decide to meet up.   


Again...20/20 vision red flags should have had me running but I stayed. We met up at a bar and got on really well. We stayed out late enough for one bars closing to end up at another bar at his request. At the second bar we end up making out. Now I'm not a big drinker and had no idea how much of a drinker he was. I can't say our levels of inebriation in terms of how intoxicated we were by comparison but by the end of it I could hardly walk.We discuss continuing the evening at one of our places, and he says he's comfortable hooking up but not having sex and I can't remember if I said something important then or only said it later after we got back to his place but I was fine with it regardless and agreed. Fooling around no problem, no full on hooking up. Cool!

He originally wanted to go back to my place although it was much further, like a 30 min taxi vs his which was about a 10 min walk up the street/5 min taxi at most.   


We get back to his place and it's honestly pretty fuzzy but we continue hooking up with some more drinks in between, he starts going below the waist. I can't remember why but I do remember after a bit of that asking if he'd like to hook up fully and he still said no and I know for sure this is definitely when I said ""ok no problem, If you don't want to fully hook up please keep your hands above my waist"" he'd give the ok, and we continue hooking up. Sure enough a few minutes later his hands go down to my vag... I ask him if he's wanting to hook up fully or what and he says no again so I say ""OK! That's fine, just please keep your hands above my waist"" again, things seem ok we continue making out and sure enough his hands go bellow the waist again... At this point I vaguely remember being confused but just asking ""are you wanting to hook up? If not please keep your hands above my waist."" I hadn't gone bellow his, we originally agreed not to hook up, this was getting confusing but every time I'd get the ""ok"" he'll stop so we'd continue.   


(for all you reading and thinking - why the fuck didn't you just leave...trust me that question haunts me all the time too!) Anyways, this went on a few more times and I remember basically telling him ""If you don't want to hook up please keep your hand above my waist because I'm going to think you're signaling you may want to move further and I'm going to ask to clear shit up""  I don't remember clearly after that but I do remember him coming back from the bathroom upset...He gets angry at me and starts accusing me of being on my period because there's like a dime size drop of blood on the sheets from, you guessed it, my vag. I remember becoming more alert and alarmed at this point. I laughed and told him, no I'm not, that's when he acknowledged the blood. I knew what had happened. He was too rough and there wasn't enough lubrication causing me to bleed.   


I remember telling him ""I think I know when I'm on my period and I'm not"" in an upset tone... Had I been more sober I would have called a taxi and left and yes... I should have. It devolves from there where he starts accusing me of trying to force him into sex, how he's upset because we agreed to not doing that. I vaguely remember being apologetic, feeling confused but not arguing with him. I think the points where I was more alert due to adrenaline I remember better vs other moments where it's fuzzy at best.  
We eventually settle into chatting and then passing out until the morning where it was like all the personality from this man just disappeared. It was creepy. Like empty eyes, completely different person 180. When I tried to leave he told me to wait so he could walk me out... Then asked for a hug before he headed off to work... I figured I'd never hear from him again and I was fine with that but he ended up messaging me days later and it just... ugh.... Man. Anyway!  


I don't know where to land on this in all honesty. Given what I know of this man and how he, for a lack of a better term because there isn't one, manipulated the truth of situation would call himself the only victim and 100% the victim, because when is he not. It's very much his boundaries matter and yours, I don't think he even hears you when you say them. Like, you, your wants, your needs matter so little that if you try to assert a boundary it's like he hears dead air...  
From what I've subsequently learned about boundaries and sexual boundaries... that may not be completely true.   


If you've managed to get this far, thank you. If you choose to comment, please do your best to be kind. For the most part, I know. I was an idiot and should have run. I already know.

Obligatory this happened years ago. I was sitting at the dining table with my parents, younger sister and her friend. I love hamsters a lot, and am quite knowledgeable &amp; passionate about them and their care. Pretty much most people in my life know this, including my sister and her friend. 

I dont quite remember how the conversation came about, but I remember talking about the different coat colors hamsters may have and which species can come with which patterns. As such, I wanted to show them (specifically my sister and her friend, who were 13/14 at the time) a picture of what I was talking about. Now I don’t know why but my brain just completely lagged and I forgot that you call animals with light yellowish fur 'creme'. Instead, I googled 'Blonde Hamster'.Now, this doesn’t seem like too much of a fuck-up, right? Google would still know what I meant. Nope, because apparently, I also put an X in front of the hamster. 

I didnt realize my mistake until it was too late - I had already clicked images. And boy, were there images. I saw at least 25 different blonde women doing all sorts of different things, and it was full screen on my computer as I was sitting at the dining table with my family and my sister’s 14 year old friend. Now I’m not religious but I think God himself came down to save me because just as the images had popped up, my sister and her friend turned away to look at something else. 

I closed that tab so damn quickly Im surprised my computer didn’t start lagging from the sudden movement. What will most definitely never be lagging again though is my brain when I try to remember what light coloured fur is called.

TL;DR When trying to show my little sister and her friend pictures of hamsters, I forgot what creme colored hamsters were called and instead searched up blonde hamsters - I also accidentally put an X in front of the hamsters part. The images were not the ones I was expecting but my some miracle were not seen by the 14 year olds.",tifu,TIFU I almost traumatized two 14 year olds because I wanted to show them cute hamsters,8.5,2022-03-12

TL;DR: I can’t give my girlfriend an orgasm in bed. 

My(M21) and my girlfriend(F20) have been together for 2 years now, living together for a year. Sex hasn’t necessarily been an issue with us. We’re open about discussions, and I’ve talked to her about being upset about not being able to give her the big O. 

Even since the beginning we’ve talked about it and she says she doesn’t mind, and that she stills enjoys the sex we have. I’ve tried a lot, I’ve gone down on her for well over an hour, giving my full attention to her alone, tried different positions, different speeds, etc. I’ve even tried bringing toys into the mix, which she said she didn’t like very much so that idea was a bust. She has always chalked it up to trauma from last relationships. Her ex wasn’t exactly “abusive” but he was very toxic, and just viewed sex as a priority in relationships. 

She’s always supportive, and never blames me for not being able to get her there, and I always help out when she finishes herself off. But now her doctor has just prescribed her antidepressants. I’m supportive, we’re very open to each others emotions and feelings about everything, but I’m just scared because this is similar to what happened in my last relationship. 

My ex and I had great sex, never had to worry about the big finish. That is, until she got on antidepressants. Then our sex lives just got completely destroyed. We ended up breaking up for a different reason entirely, but I’m still scared that the same is going to happen to my current girlfriend. I already struggle enough trying to get her to finish, but the antidepressants are just going to make it worse. 

I can see how this makes me selfish, worrying about my feelings and emotions when’s she’s the one on antidepressants. Not being able to make her finish just really eats away at me. It makes me feel like I’m not adequate enough for her, and I’m turn makes me not want to have sex as often. I hate it.

I am currently 19, and my boyfriend is going on 23 this year. When I met my boyfriend back in 2020 he was homeless. He started staying with me and my mom a few days out the week and also was staying at his friends houses whenever he could. When we first started dating, his dad invited us to stay at a hotel with him for a few weeks. His dad ran out of money and became homeless. Once we stop staying in the hotel it was kind of rough for him finding a place to stay. &amp;amp;amp;amp; for few months, me and him were sleeping outside. 


In September 2020 his dad found a room in a boarding house outside of Charlotte North Carolina that he can stay in for 600 a month. His dad knew he was homeless at the time &amp;amp;amp;amp; was staying with me and my mom for sometime so he started inviting his son over to stay.. The owner of the house a.k.a. the landlord didn’t approve of him staying there. All of last year my boyfriend was living with his dad in the house.  A few nights turn into weeks for me as I started staying there too because The landlord started asking his dad for rent money for me and my boyfriend. This was after I graduated high school last year in June. My boyfriend started staying with his dad in the boarding house in January of last year. Around Thanksgiving of last year his dad had a stroke. So he went away to the hospital for a few weeks. The landlord told my boyfriend that he couldnt stay there anymore because his dad doesn’t stay there anymore because his dad was in the hospital. The landlord was also asking for rent money from my boyfriend but he refused to pay. 



Around January of this year me and my boyfriend officially Started to live in the boarding house really without the landlord’s consent. Every time the landlord came over he would threaten to get the police to remove him from the house. The landlord even went as far as taking the TV &amp;amp;amp;amp; the air conditioning out the room we were staying in. My boyfriend started recording the landlord for harassing him when the landlord specifically said that I can’t let you stay here if you’re not going to pay rent. And my boyfriend‘s defense he’s been paying rent through his dad and there is no physical lease agreement stating that he can live here. January of this year it snowed here in Charlotte and the landlord threatened to evict everyone out the house before the storm hits. The landlord got everyone out the house except my boyfriend. 



I came home from work one day to the power being off &amp;amp;amp;amp; the water not working. He explained to me that the landlord who name was Tyrone Turn off the power &amp;amp;amp;amp; the water and it was about to snow tomorrow so my boyfriend went and got the locks changed to the house, Turn the power back on in his name and also got the water in his name. He use this stuff as evidence that he lives there so that police couldn’t evict him. 


Now we’re in February of this year and the landlord sued my boyfriend for $550 of unpaid rent. The landlord warned my boyfriend that he was going to evict him but my boyfriend felt as if he was invincible and couldn’t be touched. They went to court to were my boyfriend explain that he was a squatter and he has squatters rights. The judge said that it was something about jurisdiction that she couldn’t file in this court so he had to go to civil court. The same day after the court day the landlord came over telling my boyfriend that he had to get out and the next time he tells him to get out he will be pressing charges. Me and my boyfriend were staying there on our own without the other roommates in the boarding house since January 21st of this year. So he started saying that this is our house now and then he is going to win this house in court. We haven’t really been seeing the landlord these past few weeks but we just knew he was up to something. My boyfriend doesn’t work, some days during the week he goes with a friend to record videos for his basketball, and maybe once every two weeks he works at a security club for a night or two. But he doesn’t have an every day job to where he is making stable income. He never has. I’ve been working two jobs this whole relationship trying to keep money in our pockets because I felt as if he was very bad with money. 


On March 2 of this month, he received an income tax of $3280. And started blowing through the money. By the 10th he was completely out of money. He bought a PlayStation five, a Camera for his YouTube channel. What I thought about his spending was that it was very irresponsible because we have bigger concerns. We needed to find a stable place to stay because at the house we’re living in anything could happen at any given time and there was no lease agreement between him and the landlord stating that he legally lived there. For the past couple of months he’s been talking about getting an FHA loan. We need a down payment of at least $11,000 and I’ve actually been putting money up towards the house. I told him if he was more serious about the down payment he would have used the money from his income tax to have put it towards the house if he really wanted to get it. But he gaslighting me and told me that I didn’t believe in him. He actually brought up the fact that he told me to stay at my job for six months and I ended up quitting within three months and that’s why we don’t have an FHA loan. 


So recently on Saturday just a couple of days ago I left the house to go with my mother to wash some clothes. I told him I’ll be back later as he was in the living room playing PlayStation all day again. I told him that I left some clothes over there that I was going to come back and get to wash and when I pulled up to the house we were staying in it was about 5, 6 police cars. They asked me was i his girlfriend &amp;amp;amp;amp; I said yeah. They told me that the landlord issued a trespassing arrest on him because he is not supposed to be here. So they handcuffed him and they had him took to jail. He was in jail for a couple hours but they also said that he couldn’t go back to the boarding house. Police told me he also couldn’t keep the key that he had made to the house either and that they were giving it back to the landlord. My boyfriend insisted that they couldn’t do that to him but they said that they could because he does not live there legally. Police told me to go in the house and grab everything we ever owned in there &amp; to take it. 


I brought everything he had: computers, PlayStation’s, Wi-Fi boxes, clothes, everything.. because they said me or him couldn’t come back to the house and the landlord came right when I pulled up to see police that was there. Landlord told me that we can’t come back to the house and if we do both of us will be going to prison for trespassing. So the landlord started changing the locks and told me to get everything we had in here because we’re not coming back here. I took all his stuff that he had in the house and I put it in my moms car and we brought it back to our house.

I have tried to give subtle hints that I'd like to, but nothing. 

I want him to go down on me, but am almost embarrassed because he let me know a while ago that he doesn't really like doing it since I have ""a smell"" down there that turns him off.  He has since gone down on me, but DAMN was that embarrassing, and I can't forget that he said that.  I keep wondering if I still smell that way, and is that thereason that he doesn't do it often?  He has made comments about how much he LOVES ""eating out"", but yet, doesn't with me.  I used to go down on him a lot, and would play with his dick constantly, but since that, and him not reciprocating, I've stopped touching him so much.  I feel awkward now even trying to initiate.  I WANT to, but I don't want to be hurt and turned down.  
 
It seems that the only way we really enjoy it is if we either drink before hand, or either smoke or eat some edibles.  Otherwise, for me, at least, it just seems to be a way for him to get his rocks off and nothing for me. 

I also feel that he's not attracted to me anymore now that I'm ""old"" and have cellulite on my ass and thighs.  I got a tummy tuck for me a year ago, but also so I'd look more attractive to him.  But while he says ""hey sexy"" or ""good morning, beautiful"", he doesn't look at me and say ""you're beautiful"", or ""God, you're sexy"" or things like that.  Are those things equivalent in his mind?  Who knows.  I've told him I need the second type of compliments, but he doesn't do that. He'll occasionally say ""look at that ass"" when talking about mine, but I don't know if I even believe him anymore. 

I just want him to look at me and desire me like he did when we got together.  I know relationships grow and change, but I just feel so disconnected to him.  I've begged and pleaded for us to go to couples counseling, but he refuses.  So we just do this dance, go round and round in circles, and nothing gets fixed.  We are both horrible at communication, and while I want to save our marriage, I just don't know how much longer it will last.  And that terrifies me and saddens me.  Because I love him with my whole heart, and don't want to lose him.  But I'm so damn tired of feeling like this.",relationship_advice,In a rut with husband,5.0,2022-03-16

2022-03-16 15:54:44,4,True,1,"I have begun to have doubts about my relationship and whether I am actually happy and being treated the way I deserve. 

So my(f21) boyfriend (m20) has been living in my studio apartment with me for about two weeks now because we like spending time together and he is having some issues with his housemate. 

A couple nights ago he had a night shift and slept a few hours when he came back but stayed up all night to go to bed late. So this morning I woke up at around 11.30am and left him to sleep. I left the blinds closed and tried to be as quiet as possible. I would occasionally go over to him and give him a kiss. At this point it was around 1/2pm and I went to give him a cuddle to which he said to stop waking him up. I apologised and went back to quietly eating my lunch on my desk. He then woke up and seemed irritated so I asked him what was up and he then called me selfish and said I am not considerate of him sleeping but it was 3pm. I said I wanted to cuddle and he said that was selfish. Now he is being quiet and rude. Usually when I am in a mood he gets annoyed and tells me to stop. I sort of just let him be and went to the gym. 

But these sorts of things happen often where I am blamed for things and put down. Being called selfish and inconsiderate. Whilst he has been living here I have fed him and looked after him pretty much mothering him as he does pretty much nothing with his day. I tried to be considerate and quiet however I live in a studio and I have to also go about my day. The other day I took a salad to eat in bed and he told me to sit on my desk because the crunches are loud. He only watches tv shows and videos he wants to watch and plays tiktok videos so loud but I never complain because I want him to be happy. 

Whenever I get upset over something he has said or anything really he gets very annoyed and tells me to stop crying. Then some days he is lovely and writes me letters. He does my washing up and gives me affection and I am happy but I keep thinking it’s just love bombing and won’t last.

Another thing is that I haven’t been feeling up for sex recently whether it’s him or my antidepressants I don’t know. But he only ever gets off from me talking about other guys and making him jealous. To an extent I am okay with it but then he asks me to start talking to other guys, send them pics and flirt. To then eventually sleep with them and tell him about it so he gets turned on. I told him that’s pass mon boundaries and I only ever say I will do it because it’s the only way I can get him to cum. But he can’t seem to let go of the idea even though I have said I am not comfortable sleeping with someone else. Not right now and not without him. I shouldn’t really have to give a reason and he should just respect me. And I often feel pressured to have sex just to keep him happy and ‘love’ me.

Obviously this is just very little info and one sided but I recently have been thinking about what to do that is best for me and my future. I love him and want a future with him but is it just a fantasy and an idyllic life that I have made up in my head? Because the reality is that he switches up so often and I never feel like I am enough or doing something wrong. 

Another thing to note is that I have BPD and he isn’t very supportive of me and the ‘symptoms’ that come with it. I am never selfish or nasty intentionally and I do get stressed sometimes but that’s just because I am human tbh. I feel blamed for my reaction to his disrespect. He says I don’t have empathy or care for others. But I do. And I am starting to think the things he is saying to me is just a projection of his own insecurities.",relationship_advice,Need a different perspective on my situation,2.5,2022-03-16

It’s been long distance for the last couple months but when we were together we were intimate. Since we were in a serious relationship before it feels like we fast forwarded and are pretty serious. He’s moving to the town I live in next week and everything’s going really well except I’m worried a little about our sex life. In his last relationship he was pressured to have sex by his partner frequently and shamed when he wasn’t in the mood. He said he felt like a “human dildo”, leading him to avoid times where she could initiate sex. It became a complex for him and didn’t enjoy sex at all- I think it was a big reason their relationship ended. He also has some trauma from childhood that he opened up to me about. He’s told me that sex with me feels completely different than other relationships and he’s felt things he hasn’t felt in years, that it’s special and feels like love making. He tells me how I turn him on and I feel like it’s special but I also feel like he is a bit more sexually closed off than I am. It feels like our sex life is the same that it was 10 years ago but I have grown a lot more into my body and matured. He doesn’t know how to make me orgasm, and I don’t know how to guide him without discouraging him. Because of his past, the last thing I want is to create any pressure around intimacy, so I’m wondering how I can kind of help him tap into his own sexuality and pleasure naturally? He also has some body insecurities that I think prevent him from feeling good about sex. I want to help him grow into what he likes, and feel more comfortable and open about sex. Does anyone have any tips for enhancing our sexual connection, teaching him what I like and also coming back into his own body? I really want it to work out and am so attracted to him, but feel like I’m in a different place with my body and sexuality. Everything else in the relationship is perfect!

It is total OCD at this point and I am trying to fix it.

Also, please know I have a libido that is through the roof, and it was worse when I was younger. 

Also I do not necessarily believe in an afterlife, but I do this nonetheless 

When I was 14, I developed an obsessive compulsive disorder as a coping mechanism to deal with the fact that I could not sleep with every woman I was attracted to.

It sounds funny, but I remember the exact moment it happened. I was 14, and saw a beautiful girl in a magazine. I wanted to sleep with her so bad, so to deal with the stress I simply made up a certain set of… rules.

If I look at a girl or a picture of a girl, I simply say “and her” in my head. When I do this, there is something that happens in my mind.

Firstly, when I die one day I will one after another have two weeks alone with each girl I have said “and her” to.

Two weeks with the first girl, then two weeks with the second girl… on and on and on… 

This two weeks is spent with the girl in the exact state she was in when I “and her”d her.

She and I will be equally horny, and have a sexual love fest for two weeks, before I awake with the next one.

I have done this to THOUSANDS of women.

I have been told I am very attractive, but due to always working and never really socializing I rarely go out or sleep with women. I have the most under used libido ever, contributing to the issue. I always get looks but never act.

Again, I do not think this will happen. However it’s an OCD that I developed as a teen and have been doing it so long I can’t stop.

I have never told anyone this, and it is by far the strangest thing about me.

I tried to be as ethical as possible. I tried to support my friend and her kids the best I could. She told me I had been taking advantage of her and owed her money.

Someone suggested that I call her and let her know that I tested positive. Somewhere in that conversation, say that I'm sorry what I said came across the way it did, I had a previous relationship where my then partner could not respect my personal boundaries and therefore after I said what I said. I also lost my daughter in December (don't really want to use her for this as an excuse), and therefore many things I say now is without a filter and I'm learning again how to speak. Doesn't excuse the way I said it but it may give me a little more understanding from her part.

Every time I think of doing it, I go thru 15 reasons in my head why I shouldn't.

So Reddit should I call her and tell her and then proceed to try and apologize and cite my reasons or just let it go. Also please provide reasoning for your explanation.

From the start, I knew he liked anime and that's one of the reasons we became close, however, now that I'm getting closer to him, I can't help but realize how much of a bigger sexual role anime plays in his life. For context, he has been watching anime and consuming hentai and animated erotica for some years now, and he has a favorite anime girl that he is dedicated to. His whole room is full of posters of her, always buys anything he can get that is related to her, figures, pillows... Everything. He also had a massive collection of porn and erotica related to her (including erotic cosplays) that he had been saving for some time and used to pleasure himself. After we started dating, he noticed that that made me uncomfortable so he tried to stop consuming it as much, he stopped using naked anime girls as wallpapers (he had them everywhere) but there are still  pictures that he cannot get unnattached to (he has told me this). He used to refer to this specific anime character as his waifu and he has told me how he used to feel happy when people told him jokingly that she was his girlfriend. He also cannot bear the idea of living in a room that is not filled with his posters, and he has made this very clear to me, which disheartens me a little when i think about the possibility of living together.

2022-06-18 17:21:15,6,True,1,"  

My boyfriend and I have been dating for about a year now. To preface I am (F22) and my boyfriend is (M24). We started dating when I was a sophomore in college and my boyfriend was in his last semester of college so, we only got about a month of actual dating before we had to go long-distance. I am still in college and I just got the opportunity to have a college experience again after the gruesome two years of Covid. My boyfriend has been wonderful in many aspects such as my family and friends love him, he is a kind soul, he is so smart and makes me smarter every time we interact, and he would never cheat on me (at least he doesn’t give me that impression), and he is a provider and would do many things to make me happy. The problem I have been having with our relationship is that he refuses to work on himself and make improvements that at times affect us. For example, after about two months into our relationship, I noticed he constantly would have problems remaining erect while we had sex. I never really had this problem before in past relationships so I let it go because I thought maybe it was stress or he was nervous. To give you more details, after graduation he moved to a new city where he didn’t know anyone and he started a new job. In know… big life changes. After another two months of him having the inability to remain erect, I had brought it up for it was affecting my self-esteem and our connection in the relationship. I hesitated to bring it up for so long because I know this is a sensitive topic for men but, I felt that it needed to be done. He felt bad but responded with a rant about how he refused to go to the doctor and that he would fix it on his own. He said to just give him some time… so I did. Three more months went by and the same problem occurred. I tried to do new things and do more for him but nothing had worked. The second time I brought it up, I was a little more aggressive than I should have been but I was just so frustrated. I didn’t understand what was happening especially since we were so young, so I begged him to go to the doctor especially because it could be a medical problem or depression. I just felt that we were losing that part of our relationship completely especially since we were long-distance. I have loved him through all of this and love to be near him when I can. I even thought we would get married but, this side of the relationship is also important and I didn’t know how long I could ignore it. He again said he has no desire to go to the doctor but ""he would for me"" and that he wanted to talk to a close friend about it first. I let it go for a little to give him time to work up the courage to talk to his friend and then go to the doctor. As I have waited another couple of months nothing has changed still. Being a year into the relationship and not having decent sex while being in long-distance as well has put a toll on me. I love him very much and it is hard for me to think about breaking up with him because, I don't know if I'll ever find the qualities, I love about him in someone else. But on the other hand, I am unsatisfied with the sexual part of our relationship and it doesn't seem like it is going to change anytime soon.

2022-06-22 23:00:01,20,True,1,"I, 28M, have been dating this girl, 25F, since almost 2 years. We moved in together after few months of dating. We have been pretty open in our relationship and neither of us was the jealous or clingy type. We both had pasts and mutually decided to forget that and move on with each other. The problems I faced over 2 years:

1. According to her she was very much invested in her ex and she told me it would take some time for her to get over him. I was ok with that cause everyone needs sometime. But on multiple occasions I found out that she was secretly talking to her ex (who was married by then). I confronted her on every occasions and told her it hurts me and its already enough time. She just says that she'll need more time. Later she used to delete call logs and messages, but I found out that she sent him money over Gpay a few months ago. She just says sorry and it keeps repeating.
2. She was into BDSM with one of her casual partners in the past and did pretty much everything including oral, anal, etc. I am also into BDSM but only occasionally. She will do all those stuff with me when I dominate her. But I can't keep being a Dom daily for years while being in a romantic relationship. When I don't she refuses for oral and anything other than vanilla sex. Also she has never done anal with me, despite talking about it for two years.
3. She talks to her guy friends whom she had a history with. She said it was in the past and now they are just good friends. I wasn't comfortable with that initially but eventually I made peace with it. But on the flipside if I talk to someone I just flirted casually with in the past, she makes a ruckus and starts crying and blames me for breaking her trust and what not. I have asked her that I want to be equal in the relationship but she pulls out the ""don't compare with me"" card everything. I literally have no answer to that. The current situation is that I have stopped talking to most of my (girl) friends.

I feel suffocated in the relationship. I feel everything is going as per her will. I am not asking her to stop talking to her friends but atleast let me do the same or she should stop talking to guys whom I am uncomfortable with.

I have vented up so many things over 2 years that whenever anything happens I make her recall everything she did (and still doing) to me over past 2 years but then I get blamed for hurting her, and that I make her remember her past which broke her. I have tried to break up on two occassions. Latest one being yesterday. But it backfires on me that if I was so stuck in relationship why didn't I breakup earlier and now she is too much emotionally invested in me and she starts crying and blaming me that I am repeating the same what her ex did with her and that she loves me, promises that she will forget her exes, etc. I melt down and give up on the thought on breakup and continue being with her.

I am totally at a stalemate right now. I feel so less in the relationship. Don't know what to do and how to proceed. I also don't know how much longer can I take this toxicity. Resorting to reddit for some help.

Thank you if you read all that and those willing to help!

This man has been my dad for 20+ years, when he and my mom separated around 5 years ago I chose to live with him and it was great.
The past 1,5 year we’ve been getting in some real bad fights because we’re very alike and this clashed a lot of times.
A month ago he kicked me out because it was all too much for him and the only communication between us has been us fighting.
I actually went home this Monday to collect my last stuff, I wanted to give him a hug but he told me he wasn’t feeling well so it was best not to, he thought he had the flu.

This morning I got a call from his new girlfriend, saying she rushed him to the hospital. He texted her some very weird sentences with a lot of grammar mistakes (he’s a real smart guy and so not like him) so she immediately went to his house and when she got there he didn’t recognize her anymore and had no clue what was going on.
At the hospital he got a CT-scan and it was obvious he has a tumor. Its in the lower left part of his brain.
He slept a lot and some hours ago he actually recognized us! So thats a little bit good news.
He is scared and also devastated because he realized he can’t read or write anymore. 

He got an MIT-scan a couple of hours ago and tomorrow we will know how big it is and hopefully also the type of cancer.

I don’t know how to feel, this is so fucking scary because not a lot of people survive this. I have 2 little brothers and a very young sister who need their dad.

Before we started dating I was friends with his then girlfriend. They had been together for 5 years and she always used to tell me and other girls how great their sex life was and how often they did it, what they did. It was actually quite hot at the time hearing about it and turned me on a lot. She also would bring it up in front of him and he never denied it and would laugh and agree with her, so I know she isn't lying.

The reason her and I aren't friends any more has nothing to do with him and I dating. When he showed interest in me I was shocked. Since we started dating I can't get what she used to say out of my head because well our sex life isn't anywhere near as interesting as theirs nor are we as intimate with each other anywhere near as often either.

I have brought up with him that we don't have sex as often as I would like and he just sort of apologized, blamed being tired a lot and shrugged it off. I don't want to have to keep nagging about this.

First day of school happened and I was happy with her, everything was normal for the next few months until the first day of finals for the fall semester. Both of us and a few other friends decided to walk from school to a friends house that was a block away. And while we were hanging out, not studying at all and watching a movie. I get a call from my mother saying the cops just showed up looking for Ash. I told my mother to pick us up and take her back to the school. Turns out Ash didn’t tell her mother about our plans, and I found out about this when her mother started accusing me of sexual harassment and borderline assault. 

That was a shock, but it doesn’t end there. Weeks go by, everything settles down, but her damn mother kept popping up randomly at the school, whenever she did, she’d have her phone pointed at me like she was recording me, and once threatened to tell the principal to expel me for “what I’ve done”. 

To be clear the most I’ve ever done with Ash up to this point is cuddled with her a few times, and at that time I had little interest in sex or anything sexual, I just wanted a good relationship.

Me being the idiot I was, I ignored these clear red flags and continued being with her, until the year anniversary of our relationship. I was having a shitty day, Ash wouldn’t talk to me, people were giving me bad looks, and my mother suddenly shows up, requesting I be taken out of school for the rest of the day. When we get to her car, she says the truth, Ash was lying about everything, most importantly who I was. She was telling her mother that I was some random guy that was stalking her. 

Worst part yet, I got served a sexual harassment case against me, and had to be in court on the same day my cross country team was competing to go to finals (they made it to finals and I ran the final race that season, didn’t make it to state). But during the hearing, it was then she told the truth about us, about everything, and the judge dismissed the case. 

It’s been 4 years and even if I have forgiven her, I just can’t seem to let go of this feeling, like it was much worse than reality. The worst of it all is that whenever I’m talking with a girl, and I feel like I said something wrong, I’ll start thinking she’ll do the same thing to me.

Howdy redditors, so this happened from last night through today and im still suffering because of it. I purchased a MicroSD card from amazon along with a few things. Reason being my ""old"" samsung A5 phone is constantly full and becoming slower so I figured I'd upgrade the storage. Well in the midst of playing rocket league and some other games on my PC I was backuping up my photos and videos. I also did a backup through BOTH my samsung and google account. Well heres the thing... It didnt *\*really\** backup everything. So this is where it gets bad.

I was distracted playing games and finally backed up what I thought to be everything. I check most of my apps, made sure it would be fine, and then I got to the all mighty ***Google Authenticator***. well boy, long story short its a shit app. I goto export my codes (I have about 9 or so, for different websites and apps) and it tells me to take a picture of the QR code to transfer to my new phone. Well I do not have a new phone, cause im trying to factory reset this one, so im like ah okay ill just screenshot it. Nope, can't be done because of ""security reasons"". so I figured well hey im signed into google, and this is the *\*google\** authenticator. I can probably just sign in to my account and it'll be there for me. Oh boy was I wrong.

Fast forward a couple hours and I finally factory reset my phone, I use the backup and restore from google and samsung to get most of my stuff back. Okay sweet, let me check up on my samsung notes. Wait. My. Notes. THEYRE GONE?! So yeah, my samsung notes didn't backup ANYWHERE. so thats awesome, lost some personal information like saved text messages and all my friend's birthdays, logs of someone that owe's me money etc. etc. sick.

Now I click on google authenticator, and theres a screen telling me that I can import my codes. okay cool im signed in, it should be fine.. I click on it and it tells me to scan that QR code from my old phone. bruh, I dont have it. So at this point I freak out and goto bed. Wake up to today and same thing. I cannot get those codes back at all. So im locked out of half my social media's atm and im fucking pissed that google designed such a shitty app. and that doing TWO backups didnt even backup my notes (which I totally forgot about until after I reset my phone, of course..) And now I gotta wait for them to ""verify its me"" and wait until Monday because a billion dollar company isnt open on the weekends, awesome.

**So life pro tip, make sure you check EVERYTHING. and maybe just remove all your 2 step authenticator's for all your accounts BEFORE you factory reset your phone. Dont be stupid like me.**

TL;DR I bought a sd card for my phone because the storage was constantly full, did a ""backup"" through google &amp; samsung only to find out it didnt backup most of my files and to top it off im locked out of half my social media's because google authenticator doesn't have a way to export your log-in codes without using two phones. And you can't even log-in to your google account to get it back.

2022-10-19 02:10:49,1,True,1,"I’m 27 (f), bf is 26(m). We are long distance.. been together over 2 years. i already know majority of the replies here will probably say move on just because of the distance alone &amp; I understand why.. he lives in Germany and I am from NY. We began dating when I lived in Germany for half a year during the pandemic. I have been in many long distance relationships ( I have issues I guess) so they aren’t as hard for me as the average person at all. ( I have a decade of experience lol) 

Anyway after my last relationship I swore I’d never do long distance again and I really wanted to remain single for at least a year or two to get my shit together. Aka go back to school, work on my toxic habits, and continue making the progress I was slowly. I’ve been in therapy on &amp; off for some years now. Due to my dysfunctional upbringing it’s been rough &amp; most of my relationships have reflected this. 

My current bf, Alex, was supposed to be just a fun quick last hoorah while I lived out my last days in Europe.. turned out he was this incredible person who felt mutually about me. I tried to plead with him about why we couldn’t do a long distance, why I couldn’t.. and why he shouldn’t. He was sad but we compromised on remaining in touch. Anyway feelings obviously kept growing and an official relationship was inevitable because neither of us would be able to tolerate the other person dating others. We talked literally everyday &amp; fell in love fast. 

This is the only guy I really ever saw myself marrying. But alas.. red flags from both sides began appearing. 
He has a lot of unresolved trauma from his family, mostly his narcissistic mother and anger towards his favored brother and passive father who does nothing but stand by his manipulative wife. 

And me.. Although I made significant progress from who I was 5-10 years ago or even 2, it wasn’t enough. When I would drink I would snap. I would lose my temper about something and just behave so toxic and awful. It’s embarrassing. I hate it but once I’m in that state it’s so hard to get out. This happened about 3-4 times in a 2 year span which is more than Alex could tolerate so he broke up with me. 
(FYI we saw each other every few months ) 

He began acting distant since April &amp; that’s when our mostly great relationship changed. He officially ended things in august when I became drunk yet again. No toxic episode or anything but just the sight of me drunk was too much for him. 

I respected his decision &amp; was ofcourse sad but knew I had to move on. But Alex wanted to stay friends because I am .. currently his only friend. 
He is an introvert and focused heavily on school, his family issues, himself and I guess us.  I have friends and a support system, he doesn’t. I was his support system. So naturally, while he doesn’t want the relationship .. he doesn’t want to lose his sole support system.

But after a month of us communicating constantly, I told him I couldn’t do it anymore because I’m unable to view him as “ just a friend”.  For 2 years I thought this man would someday potentially be my husband and I really wanted this.. I’m not getting any younger. 

I think he has depression, which if he does he claims is due to his environment. And it saddens me he feels alone, so I do want to be there for him but it’s just hard for me since I am not over us.

He understood though  &amp; We went 3 weeks without contact. But then he called me on Saturday and vented to me about family problems. He also expressed to me how he does love me and sees me as his soul mate.. all these things I’d want to hear but not that he wants to be with me. 

I foolishly told him I’d be willing to remain in contact again and give him till summer to finally make a decision about us but that he can’t contact me daily. Because I’m also in an accelerated nursing program so I’m literally busy and studying everyday….. ( yeah I know. This situation just gets worse and worse ) 

Well he didn’t listen, he contacted me the next day again asking for advice but this time about something that meant he would possibly stay in Germany forever. I was hurt because just the day before I thought maybe we had a chance again.. I felt like my mind was being played with and my emotions were just chaotic. 

I told him again I couldn’t do it. I just can’t keep going back and fourth like this. We have become so toxic. I need to accept it’s over but yet I feel obligated to still be here for him. I have told him SO many times to get a therapist but he uses the same excuse “ I don’t have time”.  

I’m overwhelmed and honestly burnt out. I feel like for the past 2 years I was his part time therapist and this is my fault.. but I thought I was being a good gf. Well now his depression and mental health seem much worse, especially with me gone.

Finally, my question is, what is the right thing to do. Give him and myself tough love and cut all contact off, move on and not look back cause it’s hopeless ?
Allow him to contact me for emergencies only since he has no support system.?

2022-11-21 03:11:39,6,True,1,"A little background for clarity. At age 25, I divorced someone who was unavailable due to dr\*g additi\*n/incarerati\*n, leaving me with one child (now 38m) to raise on my own. Two years later I met another man who I basically allowed to rush me into a relationship and married within a year of our meeting. I take full responsibility for my decision to do so without having gotten to know him. As soon as we got married, and I mean that day as we drove away for the honeymoon, he began to change from a caring, attentive, good-natured person (who was great with my son), into someone who I never would had given the time of day to if he had revealed his true nature/behavior before hand. At that time in my life I was still deeply dealing with my own issues of having lived through a childhood of aband\*nment, em\*tional negl\*ct, bullying, and ostricizati\*n. There were other highly negative happenings but of a scope that I'm not sure should be discussed here. The basis of that situation was that my parents divorced when I was a baby-dad not in the picture, mom always gone, and my main care giver was resentful and basically created an atmosphere that alienated my mother and myself from most of those in our family/friend circle. So, later down the line, when I met my other ex, I thought I had finally found someone with whom I could share positive life experiences. That did not happen. When it really sank in that he was ""significantly not as described"" I got on the phone to get help from one of my family members to leave him. I did not want to be in another bad situation (especially with a small child) but a shouting match between this ex and a couple of his family members stopped me cold and I thought I understood where the behavior/attitude was stemming from and then felt sorry for him. Long story short, I stayed with him thinking that he'd been chronically mistreated and that love/kindness would change his behavior, thinking ""he deserves to be loved by someone""-something I now know was pure ignorance/ego on my part. As a result of focusing on making his life ""better"" we moved across country (no family/friend available for support) for his career. Because he was frequently out of town for work, we moved my mother in to care for the kids as I worked 40 hours a week as well (by that time, I had two more sons). We only ever had peace in the house was when my ex was away. Upon his returns, we'd have maybe two weeks of calm before all h\*\*\* would brake loose again. He barely contained his h\*tred for my mother and oldest son and I blame myself for not being smart or strong enough to leave before it affected all three boys. All the contr\*lling, g\*slighting, isolating, infid\*lities, and verbal/mental/emoti\*nal stuff as well as the property destr\*ction inside the house was overwhelming-couldn't change it for trying. When the two youngest were teenagers I finally divorced and moved as far away from my ex as I legally could and him still be able to see them (my oldest son had previously been living in another state after going no contact with me for several years due to the environment he grew up in-he and I have since reconciled). The advice I'm seeking is in regard to my middle child (my youngest currently lives with his father and though I don't hear from him unless it's to thank me for a birthday or Christmas gift, I'm hopeful we can re-connect at some point in the future). The harder issue is that my middle son is a very much like my ex (something that in hindsight I was helpless to defeat as my ex would always promote that this son was his, ""mini-me""). When he was young I had to fight with my ex to allow the child some therapy. I even took a job as a paraprofessional at my son's middle school so I could be close by during the day (which proved to be a good thing). Both a licensed therapist and a child psychologist (independent from the school) told me things that were concerning that my ex would absolutely not acknowledge or talk about reasonably so I had a hard time getting my boy the help he needed. Fast forward to when he turned 18, I was dealing with some other issues and unable to keep my home so I told everyone other than my youngest (who was still in school) that we would have to split up households. I took my youngest, while my mother and oldest son took my 18 year old with them. I'm loathe to go into the details of his behavior because I'm not trying to villify him-he's not a monster, but suffice it to say that prior to my health/financial difficulties, it was becoming difficult in the home. Some years later, I had to purposely distance myself from him but at no time was I ever not available to him if he needed me-when he called I came and I still would-in a heartbeat. But as a person with my set of particular life experiences I have learned that I must limit and protect myself from triggering events/behaviors/people or I become very depr\*ssed, anxi\*us, and reactionary. I am capable of being just as hurtful towards the people/things I feel threatened by so backtracking a bit here because it needs to be said that when I finally had, had it with my ex, my revolt was verbally messy and at times very knee-jerk (hence the long-distance move). I'm not sure how much of that ties into the current situation since the son in question has other issues but I'm willing to acknowledge when and where I'm wrong. Well, now there is a grandchild in the picture and although I was there the day the baby was born, I haven't seen them since (it's been about 8 months). My son is angry with me but will not have a constructive conversation about it. His fiance's family think I'm a horrible person (completely based on what my son has told them as I'd never met them before the day his son was born-but was proven by an unsolicited text from one of them calling me a ""sh\*t"" person). The other grandparent had treated me as if I shouldn't have been in the delivery room the same day the baby was born and was not shy about letting me know that they were holding the baby first and I was going to wait until they were done spending time with him. I didn't like it but I had no choice other than to be okay with it (it was not the time nor the place for confrontation, nor did I desire one). Experience tells me that nothing I can say will actually change someone else's narrative of me if they are not able to actually interact with me and see for themselves whether or not I'm a decent person, and I will happily stay away if it makes matters better for all concerned. I hadn't tried contacting him since then but got a text the other day saying that it's ridiculous that I don't want to be in my grandson's life-which is patently untrue. What's tugging at me now is, do I continue to try with my son for the sake of the baby? I'd love to be a part of my grandson's life but don't see how I can if I'm unable to mend this rift with my own son (he's turned down all my requests to go into family therapy for this). He wants apologies but doesn't respond well to them once given and just saying I'm sorry has never cut it-nor should it when actions speak louder than words. I'm not sure how to proceed or what to say (knowing I tend to react with tr\*uma responses). Where is the line between protecting myself and being an active/positive part of this innocent little baby's life. Do I just send gifts at birthdays and holidays with no expectation of anything of any kind in return? I can do that for the child's sake. For my own personal wellbeing, I really cannot expose myself to anymore purposeful negative treatment but at the same time I don't want to do/say anything which will hurt my first and only grandchild. Inaction seems just as harmful. Going no contact may help me personally but in the long run only helps me and I don't want him to grow up thinking he doesn't matter to me as that's not true.

I (24M) haven’t had many intimate experiences. Dated 2 girls in my life so far and got frisky with 1. Last time I was intimate with anyone was 3 years ago.

Right now, I’m in a good spot emotionally, and a comfortable phase of my life. Between finishing my degree and moving on from my last break-up, I’m discovering and enjoying the fun of being single and myself. I wanna try things. Try hobbies. ‘Start my life’. Everyday is quite exciting. And I have a lot of free time.

But God, do I MISS making out. I often fantasize about sex like every other person. But this feels different. Its more than a crave. I miss something REAL to me.

PMO only does half the job. Sometimes it even turns me off because I realize it can’t capture the personal warmth and softness of genuine intimacy. To embrace someone. Feeling them embracing me back. My heart fluttering from a mix of excitement and nervousness. Feeling their breath on my face. Feeling another’s soft lips. Tasting their lips. The friction of warm skin. Hands carresing each other. And ultimately, that europhic feeling that this other person WANTS me.

Fast forward a month or so into the relationship, the sex starts tapering off. I start to realize that I’m super horny all the time and she’s not. Then when we have conversations about it, we’ll have sex right after the convo but then go back to a dry spell. My needs aren’t being met so I suggest we breakup so we can find better matches for ourselves.

She starts panicking and listing off all the good things about our relationship. We’ve had several small discussions about her drop in sex drive, but I was never able to get an answer out of her. It was always excuses (too tired, iud horomones, etc). After some prying I finally got a truthful answer out of her. She told me that I’m not her usual type that she goes for. In her past she’s dated D1 athletes, but all those relationships ended up being toxic. When she chose to be in a relationship with me, it was because I’m sweet, attentive, and not an asshole. I become very visibly upset, and she continues. “The attraction that I have for you will grow over time, and I can already feel it growing”.

This brings me to my dilemma, wtf do I do? She’s obviously with me because she likes me (I think). But why date me if I’m not your type?

2022-11-29 19:14:47,577,True,4360,"When I was a teenager, my brother assaulted me. Despite Im 2 years older than him, he was bigger and stronger than me. He threated me with hurting me, that no one would believe me, and kept doing it until I had enough and told my parents about it. 

Sadly, he was rigth. My parents didnt believed me. They were really mad and punished me hard, for ""saying that horrible things about my brother"". He was always their favorite, so they couldnt believe he done that. I tried really hard to convince them, even showed my mother the bruises on my legs and the marks of his bites, but she refused to believe me.

The moment I was able to, I ran away from home. For years I resent them, even hated them. My brother for the abuse and my parents for doing nothing to help me. They only knew the truth because one day my brother was really drunk and told my dad about it (he told him how I was ""his first"" and how much fun he got from me). They contacted me, and I believed they would apologize, offer me help, or even make my brother face the consecuences of what he did, but no, my mother idea was that everyone must admit we all do wrong, we all made mistakes, and forgive each other for everything, so we could keep that in the past and became a happy and united family again. I left them and never talked to them again. Thats the moment I decided they were not my family anymore.

Now, in the present, after several years, lots of struggles and a long time in therapy, Im finally having a happy life. Im married with a wonderful man, and aiming to some day start a family with him. Until recently my mother found me. My father is sick, his liver is failing, and needs a new one. My mother knows that my blood type is the same as my father's, so he reached me to make me test, so I could donate my liver to him.

I told her no. I just cant, no to him, no to any of them. She said that I owe him that at least, that I was being an ungrateful daughter, that he is my father and thats the least I can do for the family, that I have no right to be so spiteful for a ""silly teenage mistake"", and I was kiling him for saying no.

I tried to stay strong, until one day my brother contacted my husband. Beside telling him about my father situation and how I said no, he told him lots of awful things and lies about me, saying how I used to be a ""easy one"", a liar, that I offered myself to everyone, he even lied on how I took advantage of him, even mentioned details of my body that would be imposible to know in a normal situation. He pointed me as the worst scumbag that ever lived.

My husband didnt knew anything about my past. I only told him that my family was abusive, bit never told him everything. He didnt believed him, but he wanted to know the truth and asked me my version. I broke down and cried like never before while I told him everything. He hugged me all the time, making me feel protected.

My mother and brother are still harassing me, trying to guilt me until I acept to do the tests. They even demanded me to apologize to them.

We don't date or spend any quality time alone together. He won't do any free or low cost dates,  so it's not a money issue. 
Since the start of the relationship,  I've been the one putting in all of the emotional work and trying to strengthen our bond.

I cook for him regularly,  make his lunches for work,  do more cleaning in the house and I still work full time at a job I hate,  sending him money for expenses monthly.  I try to offer him sex at least three times a week.  Any sex he initiates seems like it's just for him to get off and lay down while I go finish myself. I've had to buy more toys to use on myself when I'm alone just to be satisfied. I'm dry when we have sex now,  and I have to use lube a lot to make up for it. He doesn't do any foreplay either.  It's just so bad so see it written out like this, just embarrassing. 

He had never cooked for me, even when I asked.  The outings he comes up with for us always involve other people or his family.  I always have to suggest we go out or do something together alone for anything to happen. And I'm always expected to choose something to do.  Then he drags his feet and acts like he hates whatever I choose to do. Romance isn't in his vocabulary,  apparently.  

I've brought up his lack of effort multiple times.  It was even part of the reason we broke up before finally getting back together and eventually marrying. He went to therapy and started working on himself while we were broken up and asked to get back together.  I believed that he finally appreciated me and was ready to share a life together. 

I should've trusted the pattern he had of changing for a week and then returning back to his same self instead of believing his words.  I guess that's my L to take.  

I'm tired of talking about this with him. I hate the crushing disappointment and depression that follows when he starts making excuses,  gives a half-assed ""try"" at doing more and then goes back to doing nothing as if the conversation never happened. 

I know I deserve better than this.  I'm not going to beg for scraps. 

Before this,  I was social and had a fun flirty life. I wore flattering clothes, went out with friends, changed my appearance regularly,  went to karaoke and had real connections with people. I had a very pleasure focused life before I got into this relationship. Sex used to be fun and satisfying. It was with my husband when we first started dating...

The final straw was when he recently started heavily complaining about his job.  Apparently he was led to believe he would be in a certain higher up position at the beginning but and then got shoved into a lesser position.  Now he's sad because he works so hard going above and beyond and is getting no recognition or reciprocation for it. Sounds so familiar, right? I sat there listening to him literally crying about it. His anguish was real and raw. I remembered how much I've been crying about the exact situation with him. I realized how low I've fallen.  I can't even feel empathy for him when he's doing that same thing to me and doesn't have the  self awareness to notice how he's hurting me. 

I think I'm going to stop trying so hard with my husband and rekindle the spark of the old me. I'm not going to cook special meals or make lunches for him. I'm not going to suggest anymore dates or things for us to do together. I'm no longer going to pay attention to what needs doing around the house other than stuff for my needs. It's clear that my efforts are wasted on him and just burning me out.

I won't cheat on him or anything,  but I'm going to reawaken the part of me that is being killed by this stale ass relationship.

One particular night, we (3 of us) went to a club to blow off steam on a Friday night. Before we go out, I was given the title of wingman. One of my buddies (Rogers) spots a girl he knows and introduces us. She says she has 2 other friends on the dance floor and we should all hang out. We’re all thinking perfect. 

It was not perfect. While the other girls were knockouts, my girl looked like Melissa McCarthy’s character from Bridesmaids. My other buddy (Adams) begins to practically beg me to keep “Melissa” company. Rogers let’s me know that Melissa always cockblocks and he begins begging too. 

I decide to keep her company because why not. Melissa was at least funny. After dancing and talking for awhile, Melissa suggests to her friends that we all go back to their place to hang out. Her friends look at her stunned. We all agree and get to their place. 

This is where the fuck up began. I definitely know what Melissa wanted. As soon as we get in the house, the other couples split to their respective bedrooms. Melissa leads me to her bedroom. I do not want to have sex, but it feels like I’m obligated at this point. As she starts getting naked, Melissa’s demeanor changes to more serious and she says she has rules. “Condom never comes off. No oral sex for either party. No fingering. No biting. No heavy breathing. Do not touch her nipples. Only touch one breast at a time. Only 2 positions allowed. And she didn’t want me to put the “whole thing” in. She then jumps on the bed, spreads eagle, spits on her hand and rubs her vagina, and then tells me to “saddle up”. I am still soft, have my clothes on, and visibly confused. She sees my concern and gets up, still naked btw, to go to the other girl’s room. Melissa begins yelling, “I was promised dick tonight and if he says no, these mother fuckers need to leave”. The walls were very thin. I now realize I must do my duties to earn Wingman of the Century for my contributions. 

Before she gets back to the room, I get naked with a hard-on. When she opens the door, she looks at me and screams RULE CHANGE. “You can only go past your head”. She touches my dick and makes an imaginary line. She does her saddle up move again and I put on a condom and get on top. After 5 minutes of boning like I’m scooting in a chair, she stares intently at me, grabs my head, and just begins screaming aggressively. I start to wonder if my friends are playing a cruel joke on me. She says, “I’ve cum, but I still want to be bent over”. I begin to take off the condom and tell her I’ve had enough and I would rather jerk off. She looks at me in disgust and states “How dare you try to take the condom off?! I have a fiancé. Do you think he would like me seeing you cum?”. I’m dumbfounded. I put my clothes on with my remaining dignity and begin leaving. As I’m leaving, she tries to grab me. Not realizing my own strength, I pushed her so hard that she toppled over the bed like a cartoon character. I am in full on panic mode now. I didn’t mean to do that. I run out the house like a toddler who stole cookies before dinner time.

2022-12-09 20:34:54,162,True,3371,"I was living in another town with a friend for work. My husband was supposed to be looking for a job here to move here so we could both live with said friend. When we got married he was going to join the military and then backed out. Logically speaking I assumed if we thought we could handle the distance of military then we could handle a temporary distance of a couple hours drive now 2 years into the marriage. Boy was I wrong. 

He barely ever visited, a lot of times he would tell me he might visit and then just not do it. One of those times was Halloween. Where instead he went to a party and cheated on me. There’s varying stories as to wether it was just a hands make out session or more than that. I’m willing to believe him that it was just the make out session however, that doesn’t change anything for me. He hid this from me for a month while continuing to message the girl and told 6 of our friends including my own brother before uttering a word to me about this. He also did not visit me in the entire time he was sitting on this secret. He gets every weekend off work at his current job and every other week it’s a 3 day weekend. I work 2 jobs in the new city that we were trying to move to trying to help with the go cancel of moving so I rarely get a day off. When the air mattress I had been sleeping on at the new place popped, he dragged his feet and hummed and hawed about buying me a new place to sleep so I wouldn’t be sleeping on the couch while working two jobs. It took him a while but he did eventually buy me a mattress after I literally had to beg him. He controlled all of our finances at that point. 

Then thanksgiving happened and he did finally visit me, I made him a whole dinner of his favorite foods and made everything as nice as possible for him because I felt bad because he had expressed feeling lonely back at home. Then halfway through dinner one of my friends messaged me telling me he had something to tell me and if he didn’t then she would. He downplayed it said “I kissed a girl at a Halloween party”. Then I go to found out he had literally sent me pictures of this girl because he “thought I would like her costume” which I did at the time but not anymore. Then I start hearing the stories from friends who’ve been waiting to talk to me about it. Everything ranging from second base to full sex. Now his story changes to okay we made out in my car. I ask to see the messages between them because he told me “we talk a little bit she mostly talks about her kid”. What a funny joke the messages were him trying to meet up with her again and her being uncomfortable with it because she didn’t know he was married and he didn’t tell her, she found out from his instagram. I kicked him out. I had my fri new get what stuff I had left in his house at our home town out. I try to not speak ti him unless it’s about logistics. He keeps sending me selfies with our friends or with our cats that I haven’t been able to successfully get from him. He keeps asking how I’m doing and asking my roommate how I’m doing despite both of us telling him to stop. He keeps trying to talk about it saying that he thinks it got out of hand and that “the apology was going fine until my friend said it was actually sex which it wasn’t”. He doesn’t seem to comprehend that to me it doesn’t matter what it was, what matters is how he handled it. By lying to me and betraying my trust. 

Honestly fuck him. I deserve better. I’d be happiest if I never had to speak to him again. I already want to move on, I already think I may be interested in someone but ya know, I don’t feel guilty. So what if I move on quick it took him negative time to move on because we were still together.

Edit for clarification:
Since I didn’t explain it, I was out of work due to an injury for many months which led to him being in control of the finances since I had nothing. We didn’t have our accounts combined except for one joint stock account but I had to ask him for money for everything from my car payment to therapy/doctors visits the latter of which he would deny due to us not being able to afford it but realistically I know now he didn’t care because he also bought a drone during that time with the argument of it’s for work because he wanted to change careers. He changed careers in a way that caused us to lose our health insurance but not in a way that allowed him to use said drone. Once I was better and able to work again (better is a lose term because I was and still am having untreated seizures but my insurance through my new jobs will kick in February thankfully), I applied for jobs up here and got two of them and started working them. The mattress popped before I received enough pay from either job to replace it. Now that I’ve gotten a solid month of income under my belt I am financially in charge of myself now. That money I was trying to earn for us is now for me. 

Also adding to the situation I have found out from the girl that he’s still trying to get in contact with her all the while telling me that “things got out of hand”. His messages to said girl are honestly creepy. He’s so incessant with trying to meet up with her again as “just friends” despite her continuously saying she doesn’t want to be in this position. I have also found out that he went into Snapchat and downloaded all of the nudes I sent him during this long distance portion of our relationship and I’m not entirely sure what he plans to do with them but I have 1000 regrets right now and will never be sending anything like that to anyone again no matter how much distance or how much I think I can trust them. 

I am going to talk to my grandparents and see if they are willing to get my cat for me and watch her til I’m able to get her up here because I definitely have no trust anymore.

He's coming tomorrow to see me, I'm making him take me out on a date first, but I'm really scared to sleep with him. I don't want to get back with him if I'm being used. I don't want to have sex if we're not getting back together, and I'm afraid to tell him that. 

How do I talk to him about not wanting to have sex until he decides if he wants to get back together?

2022-01-09 20:10:11,4,True,1,"Hi everyone. So, me and my boyfriend have been together for 6 months. Due to circumstances, where I was almost about to end up homeless, I started living with him quite fast. Now, we’ve both had issues in our childhood and I understand it affects us all in different ways, I’m trying to heal and just recently started going to therapy. I’m a pretty open person, especially with my emotions, I really fell in love with him and he has awakened different emotions in me. He’s the first man I’m not afraid of sleeping with, in fact I started initiating it for the first time ever, I’m very affectionate and started loving physical touch, sharing lovely words etc. For some reason, he’s completely opposite, very cold. At first, I didn’t notice it so much, but as time passed, I’ve realized his affection has become minimum, if that was even possible. Because of that, and the way he started acting, for example, whenever I would ask him if he could not tell me I’m overreacting and so on he would get so pissed and yell at me, we started fighting a lot. In my defense, I rarely get angry and start fighting because I have severe issues when someone is aggressive, I mostly get panic attacks and because of my heart condition, I avoid fighting and try to solve things calmly. But if you just ever bring up anything to him, just trying to ask him to fix something, he gets so mad to the point where he punches wall, yells, and verbally assaults. I couldn’t forgive him for some things that he has said during fighting because he never apologized, and I would just bottle up my emotions. We stopped fighting but the way he is being cold is still there… Everything went downhill when one day he told me that me caring for him and thinking about making him happy is “irritating and repulsive”. He apologized, but since it’s so easy for him to be mean to me, and hard for him to show emotions and affection, my mental state is just getting worse. Now, I know this maybe sound crazy, but he got me a dog. And ever since we got him, he only sticks around the dog, shows him affection, and it got to the point where I started feeling physically sick when I see how affectionate he can be towards our dog, and can barely touch me. I know, it’s crazy, and I’m fully aware of it so I hope nobody will judge me… Today I broke down because I just want to feel loved. I feel so ungrateful because he helped me so much, he is always here to talk when I’m having hard time because of my own problems, tells me he loves me and that I’m pretty and is doing small things for me. I try to repeat that to myself every day, but sadness still overwhelms me. Whenever I ask him to show more affection, or ask him why aren’t we being intimate, there’s always a different excuse. The latest thing he told me was that he’s depressed (because his dad died a year ago, and he saw his dog getting ran over), so that’s the reason why he’s being so cold. If he didn’t give me 100 different excuses before that, I would believe him, but I just can’t make myself to believe that’s the reason, especially because he’s so closed off that he doesn’t even talk about emotions and problems, so yeah, at the end, I know literally anything and I’m left confused. I’ve tried everything. I even tried doing the most stupidest things ever to get close to him, but nothing, tried giving him space to heal because of what happened to him, nothing. I’m feeling really depressed, because of everything, I even started panicking about my future because I’m in a difficult situation even tho I’ve got a stable job, I’ve got college to finish in another town, I have no one here to help me until I get enough money to rent the apartment if we break up. It’s taking a toll on me, I even ended up in a hospital few days ago because of what seemed to be preheart attack. My therapist invited him to come to our next session so she could have a word with him and see what’s the issue. But yeah, I just really don’t know what to do, or to think. I’m crying every day, and was someone who was barely crying before this. I don’t know if he loves me, or he’s just scared or what the hell. I just wanted to share this with someone because my mind is about to explode and I can’t think of what’s happening.

There is this girl. She is a ex girlfriend of one of my close friends, let's call him Bryan. She would constantly attract attention of nasty dudes and rub it in everyone's face. When Bryan used to be with her I would tell him I am not hanging with him while she's there. She would show up anyways and follow me and drag Bryan with her to make out in front of me with him.

She had dozen rape allegations against every second guy she met. People stopped taking her allegations seriously after the people she accused of raping her were proven innocent a dozen times. Once Bryan was over she tagged along with him and they were both staying at my house. Bryan goes to buy some snacks and drinks. She and I were alone, I didn't like being alone with her and wondered why she had to stay considering we were barely acquaintances, let alone friends, and why she didn't go to buy snacks with Bryan.

She was intentionally acting uncomfortable whilst I wasn't paying attention to her one bit. Keep in mind, she could have gone with Bryan but choose to stay with me for some reason. After about 5 minutes I finally ask her what the fuck is wrong? She replies ""Don't even think about touching me until Bryan comes.""

This irritated me a lot so I finally spoke up. I said ""Don't flatter yourself. Even if I was a rapist, what the hell makes you think I would rape you? You're ugly and you stink really bad.""

Half of them couldn't come tho, cuz of the weather and cuz it was far away. So some random guys that were friends of my friend that the house belonged to. I was really shy but eventually everyone cheered me up to have fun with them. 
 
#The Actual Story

As i said, i was really shy so i decided to get drunk really fast so i can stop being shy and start having fun. 
 
And thats everything i can remember from last night. I only remember drinking and then i woke up on a couch, covered in vomit, it was cold af and there was something in my hair that i thought its vomit as well. I was thinking ""who the fuck vomitted on me"". 

I waited for others to wake up and i literally felt like shooting myself after they told me what i have done. 

So apparently, i have gotten really drunk, and someone had to hold me while i pee (as i said im really fucking shy so i don't even know how i have managed to pee while someone is next to me).  But thats just the good part of the story. Later on, i have made friends with someone who got really drunk too, i slept in one bed with this dude. But guess what, somehow my pants have slipped down and my ass was naked and my hand was on this dude's dick. People took a picture of me but they said they deleted it afterwards. I swear this isn't a shitpost, i don't know how it happened.

 Later on, others decided to prank the guy who was sleeping next to me so they got a condom and filled it with soap or something, they put it on his forehead and woke him up.
They told him that i have fucked him in the ass while he was sleeping (keep in mind he is drunk af and doesnt know whats happening). He says like ""Ain't no way he fucked me"" and they have told him to check his ass, so he just grabs his cheeks and he is like ""HOLY FUCK HE ACTUALLY FUCKED ME"". So he got ul from the bed and was like trying to fight me or something but i was just sleeping. 

After all that happened, this guy went back to sleep (in the same bed as me, again) But i have woken up and started vomiting fucking everywhere, and i was fucking vomiting solid meatballs, let me tell you, it didn't smell good. I was covered in vomit so my friends have tried changing my clothes (keep in mind im fat and i am super super insecure abt my body so im even shy to go out with just a shirt). When they told me the naked ass part and the changing clothes part i nearly fucking fainted. 

After i woke up i had to clean the vomit myself with a fucking spatula cuz we had nothing else to clean it with. I was smelling so much like vomit, even I couldn't fucking breathe.

Basically, i got home super late ( at around 10pm) and i just didnt go to school because im dying. Im traumatized from the videos of me that i saw and that everyone saw my fat naked body and ass. I can't get it out of my head.

2022-04-12 02:59:48,2871,True,13372,"So, two days ago my girlfriend caught me watching lesbian porn and she freaked out at me for being disgusting, I explained to her how I was just struggling to fall asleep and put on some porn so that I could get off and fall asleep immediately afterwards. 

She calmed down and told me to go take a shower, so I did but when I came back, she was lying down on my bed watching the same girl on girl porn I had been watching when she'd caught me.

she invited me to join her, and we both enjoyed the new kink we'd just discovered. 

Fast forward to next evening and she tells me how it was so fun, and she was able to cum twice without doing anything; I felt good thinking she liked it more because it was her first time watching lesbian porn but she tells me she hasn't stopped thinking about what those two girls did in that video and that she has since masturbated twice to the thought of being in the middle of those girls. 

I didn’t say anything and ignored it as I thought she was just horny and wanted to go to bed for some sexy times.

But she starts to tell me how we’re both just 21 and should do things that only very young people like us would do, I ask her what she is trying to say and she tells me she would like to go to a sleep over and probably try out with her best friend what she saw in the porn, I couldn’t control myself and left the room saying if she wanted to break up she should just say it instead of making things up to try and make me get mad at her and then use it as an excuse for ending things with me; she starts crying and tells me how she can’t live without me and that she loves me but she wants to be able try a few things before it’s too late. 

Next morning after thinking things through, I told I am willing to give her time and that we will still be together, but she can do what she wants with that girl but on one condition and it’s that if she happens to realize she likes her more than me, she will break up with me or let me break up with her without making it a big deal. 

She agrees at first but tells after an hour that I should also come and play with them, I immediately reject the idea because at this time I’ve heard her talk about girl-on-girl sex more than 100 times in the last 48 hours so I told her she and her best friend both should do it alone and figure out what they’re. 

I don’t hear back from her for the next few hours and then I get a call from her best friend who she was going to sleep with, and she tells me my girlfriend enjoyed the threesome and that she wants to continue to keep trying it and that I am not to see her again, I didn’t understand what she meant so I asked what threesome and she immediately hangs up. 

I rang my girlfriend and it turned she went and slept with her best friend and her best friend’s boyfriend because her best friend didn’t want to do anything without her boyfriend. Now I am single and missed out on a great threesome opportunity.

I’m still working on things myself. I really like this guy.. however I for one am a highly sensitive individual. He on the other hand is not a very emotional/empathetic person at all. With that being said, I’m not really sure he knows how to be there for somebody like me. 

He asked me to hang out today and I had told him that I just don’t think I would be the best company because of the way I am feeling. (Also I have been waiting for him to get a negative covid test). So in response he says “okay cool down then.” Which is kind of annoying bc I am cooled down, just in my feelings a bit. 

Soon after he sends a pic of his negative test and says “now come get ate out pls” and I said “maybe I will” in which he then responds “Or not. You in your feelings. Recover”

Not sure if I’m thinking to much into it but I just think this is a little bit insensitive. This week has been pretty rough for me. I’ve been trying to ride it out on my own though because the last thing I want to do is be an emotional burden on someone, especially someone I’ve only been talking to for 4 months. So with that being said I would never rely on him or anyone to make me feel better or to be responsible for my happiness. But if he wants to be with me oh so badly, I just think he can offer a little more support or reassurance and show me that he is someone I can lean on when times are rough.

2022-05-07 01:25:59,3,True,0,"First off, I know I am in the wrong. I made a terrible, terrible mistake.

My relationship felt dead in the water, we are only 30 and we go nowhere, I work full-time and do all of the housework, I honestly felt like he disliked me.
We've talked about it a million times and nothing changes, I've felt lonely for a long time.

I made the biggest mistake of my life to date - I've ruined my relationship over an online only fling, I had to come clean and tell my partner as it happened the night prior to breaking up and it did 100% help me make the decision to finally give up on us.

I wasn't expecting what I got from my partner when I broke it off, he asked for another chance.. started helping me, really trying to revive our relationship and I couldn't watch him do this without coming clean, so I did.
He has since asked to see the messages, I really didn't want him to see them as it started as a friendship then gradually over a week turned into an exchange of sexual fantasies involving eachother and an exchange of lewd photos.. I admitted to all of this to my partner, he deserves that. 
Although I feel sick at the thought if him reading it in black and white he said that's what he needed in order to help him heal and I owe him that so I downloaded my whole insta.. but the messages aren't there. I let him redownload it on my phone and look through it to prove I hadn't messed with the download.

We've been trying since and telling eachother how much we mean to one another, I really do adore him, I felt we were in a rutt after 8 years and I got attention and appreciation at a time when I felt particularly down about our relationship and really felt like it was all over, I know this isn't justification. I know what I did and I can't forgive myself, I hate myself, I feel sick when I think of the affair. Every time I look at my partner I can't believe I did this to him, and for what?!!
Half an hour of being someone's masturbation material because it made me feel 'nice'.. I'm pathetic I really am. I just don't know what to do.

I told my partner who the other guy is (he's a YouTuber) 🤡 I know right. I guess I just felt flattered, beautiful.... He was someone who lives his life while I feel myself and my partner are stuck. I'm embarrassed by the whole thing, it's cringey and horrible and I'm a prick.

My partner wants to message him and 'get his side' for all this makes me want to curl up in a ball and die as I can't see any good at all coming from it, I think my partner wants to get screenshots of the messages from him as we couldn't retrieve them ourselves. I feel like he won't give up until he has the messages... What does this mean? Is the trust gone completely on his side? 

I don't know why I don't want him to message the guy, I just really really don't want those worlds colliding as I can't see us getting past it if he has the messages in black and white, I'm scared they will be brought up in any future argument or held over me as a threat almost, I don't know. I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and I feel myself disassociating from the situation constantly, I get so overwhelmed that I feel nothing. I just sit and it's like I feel nothing other than my world crashing and burning.

The tittle pretty much sums it up, but if you want to continue reading, it will be pretty lengthy because every time I want to write sth like this, I end up saying that things will get better or I'm just overreacting/overwhelmed so things have been bottling everything up

{tw: abuse }

(I'm not looking for sympathy or anything, it's just that I need to wake up in 2 hrs for a very important exam and as u guessed it I can't sleep so I'm going to try this, and hopefully I don't delete it when I ""wake up"")


I'll start with my mom, so that I can get the biggest portion off my chest; but basically she's a real monster, whenever I see moms and kids with a healthy relationship my heart aches because even though all 3 of my siblings have been abused too (18 yr old sister, 6 yr old brother and my 3 yr old brother) she's been especially cruel against me. My dad and sister noticed that, she even did and she 'jokes' about it. I had several severe injuries because of her yet she still jokes about it (she broke my head two times and during the second time she kept laughing about it while I was bleeding).
She's very embarrassing so she's the reason that I don't go out with friends or bring her home (not embarrassing as she shows them my pictures in diapers but as in saying disturbing things abt me for fun) 
Our house has good and up-to-date furniture but my sister and I don't invite friends because my mom has it clustered with all sorts of things that I'm pretty sure she can't keep up with (it's nice to have stationary or something like that when I need it w/out having to go out but if I can't even get to what I want then it's useless) and because of her overbuying stuff we're not really well off, she thinks she's being smart with finances and getting things when they're cheap, but when I visit my father's colleague's houses (with the same salary and number of kids with similar ages) it's noticeable that the problem is not the salary. 

She never explained periods to me, and my sister thought that she'd actually lay an egg when she was younger. I didn't tell her when I got my period because thankfully my skl gave us a briefing abt it but my sister told me that my mom kept Staring at her private parts when they were in the bathroom. 

She would always try to tell me that I'm her favorite but it's hard to believe that when she's the reason my father and I are depressed and now we have an awkward air because of her. 
(which I'll explain later) 
I thought that maybe she was like that because it's her first time being a mom (ik two kids and twelve years are enough but I was trying to justify it) until the neighbors kept coming over and telling her that hearing my sister's and my screams were heartbreaking and when she started hitting my 3 yr old brother, that's when I was sure that she's sick. 


Enough abt my mom and abt that part of my dad 
Basically he would treat me like a human being because my mom wouldn't, but then she started being delusional and jealous when my father would tell her to stop hitting me or if he sided with me. It kept growing into her making a scene if he held my hand if it was crowded or if we're crossing the street. 
Now even though she is currently in another country (for my sister's college) my father still does not have any direct contact with me (usually when we travel, my father would travel after us for work and I normally cry when we're seperdated and this year I had to travel completely alone but he didn't even hug me. He hugged my sister goodbye so it isn't a him problem but a my mom being delusional problem) 


As I said before, we're not broke, but my mom has a spending issue. I really need to get a new phone or laptop because my phone is half black and it laggs when I touch a certain area so I'm literally not being a brat, and the laptop is a shared laptop (I'm currently the only one using it because my mom and siblings are in another country and my father has his work laptop) but it's also really laggy, I've missed important sessions because of it and almost a test. 
Bg info my sister has the newest iPhone, and a MacBook, my brother has an iPad and the youngest has a new phone (not hand me down) My mom has a note ten my dad has the note 20 and my phone lagged sixteen times while I was texting this 
My father offered to give me his old phone, but he still uses it and receives things from it so I refused and I feel so bad about asking him to get me a new one because he just had an argument with my mom abt her spending a lot of money. 


Literally no one knows abt all of the feelings that I have been bottling and everyone thinks I'm a carefree teen who is a class clown and the teachers favorites and a very sociable person. No one believes that I got bullied and cyberb bullied alot and my classmates would make very mean and insensitive comments abt me saying 'oh it's ok she doesn't get sad'  right to my face 


(tw scuide thoughts) 

I never wanted to tell anyone any of this because I am aware that I do say mean unjustified things to pple sometimes but, I have been having self harm thoughts or suicidal thoughts but I believe that hospital fees/ death process are expensive. 

I always thought that I would never tell anyone about this, because it's the one thing I tried so hard to hide but I wish that writing it here helps. 






(idk where to put this but this is also sth no one knows abt not even my sister) 
I' hate' hugs or so everyone believes. The reason I am not fond of hugs is because in 5th grade, the counselor would enter our class ( a class full of tweens going through puberty or girls who still have no idea what it is like me) and tell us that we smell awful and that w our periods, we're going to smell putrid and that we don't smell ourselves and the myth of girls being disgusting on periods. Naturally I thought I was contributing to the smell and that everyone can smell me, but me. Even though I don't produce body odors as much, I still fear that I would hug someone or be close to them and them smelling foul smell on me. I am very hugsick(?) and I pretty much need a bear hug but I am far too insecure about it :).

I know that I’m the one being weird by feeling this way and that this isn’t an uncommon thing for people in relationships to do, but I just feel hurt and like I’m not enough for him sexually. I absolutely shouldn’t feel this way - he treats me incredibly well and regularly tells me how beautiful and sexy I am - but I still feel so self conscious and weirdly jealous that he gets turned on by people who aren’t me. 

I already expressed that it made me sad to hear he does this, and he said he could stop watching it if it’s a problem for me, but I feel like it’s not my right to ask him to stop doing this. I feel like that would be intrusive and controlling of me. I told him that and said that it’s his business and he can do whatever he wants, but I feel pretty torn up about it and don’t know how to move forward. I feel like I shouldn’t bring it up again because then I’d be going back on what I said about it being his choice. 

But I don’t know how to (or even if I can) get over this awful feeling of jealousy and insecurity. I’m worried that it will eat at me until it becomes obvious that something is wrong (I’m pretty transparent with my emotions) and don’t think I could lie to him at that point. 

So should I bring it back up, or should I keep it to myself and try to get over it? Does anyone have any suggestions or ways of thinking about this that would help me get over this?

2022-05-23 03:04:25,0,True,1,"TLDR - I think my ex sexually coerced me and it’s been fucking with me ever since

My ex became mean in the last stretch of our relationship. Whenever we were alone together, he pushed me to be sexual with him. He started guilting me whenever I didn’t want to, saying i was wasting his outfits and wasting his time. Whenever I just wanted to cuddle or talk, or whenever I was just having a bad day, he would make me feel like I was doing something wrong for not wanting to do anything sexual. He made me feel like I wasn’t putting out on purpose. 

Whenever I said no, he would cuddle for a bit but then start asking and pushing for me to do stuff with him again. I’d say no again, and he’d always let out a deep and disappointed sigh for not getting me to do what he wanted. During one of our arguments, he even said if we weren’t gonna do anything sexual, he’d rather just go home and watch porn. It really made me wonder what the point of me being there was. Was I just there to touch when he was in the mood?

I started to feel really shitty for not being able to put out as much as he wanted to, and I ended up  consenting even when I didn’t really want to, just to avoid him making me feel like trash for not being in the mood. It made me feel really objectified, as if I wasn’t good for anything but to be sexual with.

I ended up breaking it off for this, among other reasons. Even so, I still see him around school and during events. I get uncomfortable seeing him and being around him, and it sucks that it’s mostly unavoidable. A lot of my friends are still friends with him because most don’t know what happened between us, so I often see around when I’m with them. Since most of them don’t know, I try not to take their friendship personally, but it’s hard to not be uncomfortable with it.

I’m mainly scared of how this will affect me in my future relationships. I’m scared I’ll subconsciously put their feelings before mine and do things I don’t really want to. I’m scared I’ll feel useless whenever I’m not in the mood. I’m scared I won’t be as cuddly as I want to be, in fear that I might be wasting my partner’s time.

It’s hard to process everything when I’m not even sure how to label it. I think sexual coercion is the closest term. Even then, it’s hard because it doesn’t feel like it’s a big deal, and like I’m overreacting. I asked one of my close friends if he could stop talking to him after I talked about what my ex did, and he said nothing happened to him, so he doesn’t feel like he should cut him off. This really made me feel invalid and like what happened to me wasn’t serious nor important.

2022-05-23 03:07:27,36,True,38,"I have been with my girlfriend for almost three years. There have been ups and downs in the relationship, but we love each other, so we have sorted the past issues in the relationship. For the past two years, she hasn’t been showing interest in sex. I don’t force her or anything, but whenever I talk to her about having sex, she says she’s not interested. We’re still in the relationship, but the last time we had sex was in January 2021. 

After that, she wouldn’t have sex with me. She said she loves me, but she’s not physically attracted to me anymore and that she needs some space. When asked for a reason, she said that I was the reason. When I pressed further, she said I don’t put any effort into the relationship, and that I was unmotivated and did not have any goals. I was hurt, but I agreed to work on myself and put in more effort into the relationship. 

Six months later, I took her on a 3 day trip to a tourist place to enjoy a weekend, but when we reached there, and when I tried to touch her, or kiss her, she would turn me away. I was hurt  but she said she’s still not attracted to me and needs time and that I’m not yet there with my work in the relationship. I accepted it again and waited. 

3 months after the trip, in October 2021, I moved to a different province for my job. I did not like the place, because I was missing her, but I had to do this job. We were talking, FaceTiming and keeping up with each other in long distance, but I was unsatisfied regarding my sex life. I have told her about this a couple times about my sexual needs, but she brushed them off saying she does not feel like having sex, I was the reason, and I only need her for sex in the relationship, etc.

I did not say anything to her and sucked it up thinking I was not doing much for her. Then I booked a flight to meet her on the first week of May 2022, but something came up and I couldn’t get days off from work during that time. So I canceled the flights and booked flights two weeks from the first date because I missed her so much and well, to get some much needed action.

I went to meet her this week for 3days, and it turned out to be a disaster. I met her and hugged her and decided to take it slow. She was happy to see me. I didn’t push her or anything immediately, but when I tried to kiss her the next day, she still held me back, but let me kiss her after almost begging. That left a bad taste in my mouth. And the same day, we went for a movie in the afternoon and after the movie, I was planning to spend some time with her alone, but she took me to a mutual friend of ours who she was helping with some documents and stuff. We ended up spending 6 hours at the friends place and left there at 11pm. 

I was frustrated, but didn’t show at the time. I waited till next day, and when it became noon, I talked to her about the previous day and that I wanted to spend time with her and not with the mutual friend and that I’m tired of this. I told her that I don’t feel wanted in this relationship and that my needs are not met. She said that the only thing I need is sex from her and that I don’t care about anything else. I told her that was not true and that I loved her, which is why I waited this long for her. She said I’m still not putting enough effort into the relationship.

I snapped and said that I have put the most effort I could in the relationship and that I have given you enough time for you to heal and that this is not working for me. I asked her if she has any feelings for me and she said that she loves me, but she doesn’t feel any physical attraction to me. It hurt me so bad and I got angry and told her you’ve wasted my time for the past year and a half manipulating me by telling it’s my fault, and that I’m done with her bullshit. She started crying telling me that she loves me but she doesn’t know why she doesn’t feel like that.

I said I don’t care anymore. I said this relationship is not working for me and she needs to do something if she wants to keep the relationship.

Today I decided to do some much-procrastinated garden work. I put my bug spray on, I lit some citronella candles, and I grabbed a beer to enjoy while I worked. I put on some leggings because I figured they would be cool enough to not be miserable while still protecting my skin against unsavory bloodsucking bastards. 

I live in Alabama. The mosquitoes here in the South are hellish. I should have known that nothing short of a beekeeping suit would keep me safe. 

Fun fact: when you bend over (as one tends to do when gardening), the fabric in the back and crotch of your leggings stretches out to be perfectly thin enough for mosquitoes to get through! 

I was outside maybe five minutes when suddenly it felt like my butt crack was being lit on fire. I frantically stood up and started essentially slapping my own ass to try and stop the itching pain (I can only imagine how it must have looked to any innocent bystanders). It just kept getting worse, so I ran inside and ripped my clothes off to get in the shower.

I took a peek in the mirror before hopping in the shower, and it's not a pretty sight. It looks like Satan's herpes all over my butt and bits. As of typing this post (who knows if more will appear as the day goes on) I have 27 mosquito bites on my swimsuit parts. I'm not sure if I'm more uncomfortable from the physical pain or the embarassment; either way, the rest of the garden work is going to have to wait.

I need advice on the sex life between me (23F) and my boyfriends (32M) sex life. For context, my boyfriend and I met online. We have been dating for two years having never met each other. Just this past week, we were finally able to meet each other in person and we're having a two-week vacation together. Sex has always sort of been a problem. I'm a 23 year old woman with a higher sex drive than him, and I've always complained about feeling like I always initiate sexual interactions. I was really looking forward to this trip because we would finally be able to meet, and I would be remiss to say I wasnt excited to have sex. The first night was amazing. We stayed up until about 4am just exploring each other's bodies. The second night we were both tired, so we didn't fool around. The third night, early on in the night I put on a new lingerie outfit I bought and surprised him. He reacted positively, then after some heavy petting he said we needed to get to sleep. In his favor, we did have an early morning, but the change from being excited to suddenly not felt jarring. We had a few travel days and now the past few nights have been rough. We both woke up in the middle of the night last night and felt the energy to have sex. We did, and afterward I asked if he would eat me out so that I could cum. He just said the word ""no"" with zero explanation. I asked him why not, and he didn't really have a response. After me asking multiple times, he just said that he didn't want to have to brush his teeth again and he would touch me with his hands. Jump to tonight and we're getting ready for bed. We sort of start heavy petting, but he's made it clear that he doesn't want to interact sexually tonight as he is very tired. After I notice that he is hard, I ask him if he wants me to go down on him and that I know it would be just for him and I wouldn't expect anything back, and also that if it was okay if he didn't want to as he said he is tired. He said yes, but in the middle of it he said he wanted to have sex.We did, and afterwards I asked if he would play with me, as I took him asking for sex as a sign that he was awake enough to move around and have sex. Once again, just the word ""no"". No explanation. Eventually, after me asking different ways, he said that he doesn't want to do anything after he cums, and that I came when we had sex. I explained to him that for women, penetrative orgasms are different than clitoral orgasms and that the penetrative ones are not fully satisfying. He doesn't respond to me, and after a little while if silence he says he wants to go out and smoke a cigarette on the balcony. I go with him and try to talk to him about how it doesn't feel like my needs are being met. He completely stops responding and I ask him to talk to me about this. He responds by saying he doesn't know what to say, so I decide to go inside as there's no point sitting in silence. Once he came back in, he asked if I was okay and I told him that I really feel like my needs aren't being met. He told me that he doesn't know what I'm talking about and that he has eaten me out multiple times. I tell him that that's not true, and he says that he doesn't know how to help me. Eventually he just walked away from the conversation. When I asked him why he walked away in the middle of a conversation he asked what I wanted him to say. I told him that I wanted him to tell me that he will try harder to satisfy me and that he understands what the situation is. He half-heartedly says ""oh sure"" and talk about how he will try harder, but none of it was believable. He says that he's exhausted and needs to go to bed and then leaves. I don't understand how he can be awake long enough for me to go down on him, us fuck, and him go out for a 20 minutes smoke break, but he's too tired to go down on me and he's too tired to talk to me. He seems to be so frustrated that I'm asking him for this. I don't know if he's just not attracted to me, if he's used to not having to get the woman to orgasm as well, or what it is. I know that when we have interacted sexually on this trip, it's usually not the best timing as we're both usually tired, but I've also asked him to initiate interactions and he seems largely unwilling to do that too. I don't know what else I can do. I haven't met this man in person for two years, and I want to give him space if he needs it, but we have a limited amount of time together and I value the sexual part of a relationship too. It seems like he's not giving me the same things that I'm giving him. I don't even know how to approach this with him anymore. What can I do?

This is a throw away.

While this fuckup technically happened over the last week I only realized it last night.  So last week I moved into a first floor apartment, in one of the biggest cities in the US, on a very busy intersection. The apartment is a small studio with large windows that face the street and are conveniently right next to the building entrance. 

At first I was unsure of the apartment because I was scared of creeps looking through my window but both the landlord and former tenant (separately) explained that the glass was tinted. During the day when you look through the window you can't see anything unless there is a light right up against it and thats all you can see, just the light bulb. I checked and double checked and triple checked this. I'm a very anxious person.

 Over the last week I've been slowly moving in, bringing a car load of stuff over each day. I currently have a lot of stressful stuff going on in my life so between that and the move I would be exhausted at the end of each day. I would be too tired to cook and too tired to pick up food so I would always have food delivered. im also new to the area and don't know anyone yet. All of this meant that I never went outside at night.

To relieve some of this stress I would usually shower and then masturbate before going to sleep. I also generally like to sleep naked and after i dried off from the shower I wouldn't put clothes on until the next morning. This became my nightly routine over the last couple days.

 Well last night I realized that I hadn't moved my car to the other side of the road, which is something I have to do for the streetcleaners depending on the day. so I ran out to do that quickly and as I walked out and passed my front windows I almost shit myself because I. could. see. into. my apartment. For some reason it never crossed my mind to check what the visibility looked like at night and that is where I fucked. up. Apparently at night the whole room is completely visible when the lights are on and since I'm still moving in there's no curtains up. just my bed and a TV. 

So for the last 5 nights when I was naked walking around, cooking, watching TV, unpacking and best of all jerking off. Anyone that walked by my apartment saw me clearly through my windows, while I thought I was in a completely private space. 

This is easily the most embarrassed I have ever been in my life. If anyone saw me (which atleast one person absolutely did) they must have thought I am some creep. I haven't even been here a week and everyone on my block probably has seen me naked or knows who I am. I dont want to live here anymore but have a 1 year lease. fuck me.

2022-08-15 05:20:04,5,True,1,"So have been exclusive for about 4-5 months, recently she has become very vague with details of her days and at times the details given are changed the next time it is spoken about if it is brought up again, usually by her. Along with recently not responding to texts or snaps but is active on snapchat and social media ( this also is fairly recent within the last week or two). I work away for 2 weeks at a time and about a month ago I had come home, we were together and without too much detail let's say I noticed a linear line type bruise along her ass. Didn't think much of it but asked how she got it out of curiosity. She replied that it was only sunburn tho I've never seen someone burn In such a way. This made me a little more curious as it was visibly a bruise and there were no other signs of sunburn. Also was similar line like bruising on her thigh. Now those went away as I was off at home and I never really thought of it again. Until now, I was at work, we may have been face timing and initiating some NSFW things. Though she didn't want to turn around whatsoever, refused no matter what I said which she is more than comfortable with it any other time and place. Even recent events like the one described. When she finally did turn around it was very brief and she seemed nervous. Which In that short amount of time I noticed another very similar bruise to the one that had been noticed a few weeks ago. When I asked about it she acted as if she didn't know about it, when I made it clear that there was one and that I was sure of it she then said that she thought that had gone away ( referring to the bruise I had noticed while off from work a few weeks ago) this made me ask why she tild me it was su burn and she couldnt provide an answer other than i wasnt sure what it was. A little odd because she was very confident and convincing when stating it was sunburn previously. I stated that it definitely had gone away and this was new in which she then proceeded to tell me she forgot about it, which doesn't add up with the previous statement of it went away. It did go away so this is for sure new. Her story changed once again during the conversation and she admitted that she knew about it and it wasn't her reason for being uncomfortable. So it went from, an assumption, to ""forgetting"" to she knew it was there. This raised some concern as if it were nothing she wouldn't have changed the explanation multiple times. To add to this she is into very mild bdsm such as restraints/being tied up/cuffed. The bruises appear as if they were made by a I'd like to say a rope or even let's say almost resemble a panty line tho that seems like a stretch as I don't think they would bruise her. To add to it she was very defensive and nervous throughout the conversation. The conversation ended with her being very assertive about me not requesting anything like that if she says that she isn't comfortable which would be more understandable if she hadn't been more than comfortable In the past.

I (15F) think I was Sa'd. I honestly don't know how to put this into words so I apologize for anything that doesn't really make sense but I feel like I need to talk about this so I'll explain the best I can. When I was younger from 5-12, I had a step father who we'll call J. When I met J he was very caring, kind and always tried to make me laugh. Me being 5 took to him immediately and we became pretty close, J was like the father figure I never really had. I don't really remember much of my childhood but the parts I do remember always had J in them. As I got older I noticed that J had some horrible anger issue and he would usually take his anger out on my brother. When my brother turned 18 he joined the marines and it was just My mom, Me and J. As soon as my brother moved out all of J's anger was directed towards me. Besides the fact that J would make fun of me and constantly degrade me about everything he liked to talk about my body the most. I was around 8 or 9 when he started to comment on my body. He would constantly say things about my butt, he would talk about how it was small or how it was getter bigger. He liked to tell me how fat I was and that I should lose weight or go on a diet. J would also bite, pinch and smack my butt and ""tickle"" me I didn't see anything wrong with this at the time because I thought it was normal but that isn't really what bothers me the most now. I have a couple memories of J being weird and trying to touch me but my first memory when I was 9. I had been In the shower and I guess I was taking too long but I remember J coming in because he had to pee. This was weird to me because J would often pee off the back porch even if the bathroom was empty. I might be overthinking this part but I remember seeing his outline through the shower curtain and he was telling me not to look in a teasing kind of way like he wanted me to look. The second memory that really sticks out to me now was when I had just gotten out of the shower, I was 10 at this point and I was changing but my door was open J came down the hall way while I was changing and peeked in my room. When I looked up I caught him and he kinda just stood there until he said ""oh no I saw you naked "" and ran back down the hall. The last memory was where I think I was Sa'd. This day was on a Sunday my mom always worked on Sundays but J had Sundays off.  I was 11 I think and it was around 10 in the morning, on these mornings I always left my bed to go cuddle with J and sleep in their bed since it was comfy. I was cuddling with J and he always used to rub my stomach but that day when he was rubbing my stomach he went a little further down the he usually did. he started from my belly button to the top of my underwear and then he lifted up my underwear. I knew that something wasn't right but I just pretend to be asleep because I didn't want to upset him. After that he started to move his hand down, I rolled over so he couldn't do anything else and I think he had realized that I wasn't asleep so he got up. Even almost 4 years later I haven't been able to fully process that this actually happend and sometimes I convince myself it didn't so I dont have to think about it anymore but I still honestly don't know how to feel about any of it.",TrueOffMyChest,I think I was SA'd and I don't know how to feel,1.0,2022-08-15

2022-08-20 04:06:36,2,True,1,"(TW: medical issues)

For the past several years I've had issues with my feet; minor things like ingrown toenails, a very stubborn wart, things like that. This January I noticed a shadow under one of my nails as well as it and another nail on my other foot getting thicker. I brought this up to my podiatrist, who brushed it off as ""trauma to the nail bed from the ingrown nail procedure."" 

Two weeks later I went back (routine appointment for the wart thing) and I brought it up again. She agrees to take a sample, but does so from *neither* affected nail. She doesn't even touch the two affected ones or even take a sample from them for comparison! Three weeks after that she says the lab results say everything is normal.

Due to general life circumstances I haven't been back since and it's only gotten worse. I fear I may lose at least one, if not both, nails. Doing some research myself makes me think it's a fungal infection of some sort, but even if it isn't it makes me angry that she didn't seem to care much about it until I forced the issue.

I don't even trust her with the wart thing again. I've had it for nearly seven years now, and she's yet to get rid of it last time I was there. And looking back at it, I wonder if even that was mishandled. I thought it was normal, but talking with others has shown me it's not and that hurts to think about.

The entire situation makes me want to cry because I don't handle medical situations well (and never have) so the thought that I may have to go through a nail removal is driving me to tears just thinking about it.

2022-09-06 02:09:37,0,True,1," Tried to post this in OffMyChest and it was denied for some reason. Was searching Reddit for other subs to just ""let it all out"" and found this one among others.

I'm just so tired of it all. I'd move if I had the option to. I hate living with them

Today my parents accused me of being secretive and sending my mail to the big town over (30 min away by car) to hide things from them. Yes and no. Yes being you go through my mail demanding to know what it is and no because since we are in the middle of nowhere, postage is higher because its considering rural, and mail takes a lot longer to reach us. For example, Amazon prime takes 2-5 weeks to show up whereas the town over takes up to a week and has those Amazon lockers and pick up points. I fucked up and forgot to destroy the label because I just got done a 6 day 44 hour work week and I am still very much exhausted. I tried to argue my case and they angerily said **""No, no excuses""**

Other times where they have falsely accused me of shit

* That I'm gay because I am not in any romantic relationships with any men  

   * I used to be in a horrible relationship with a man and once I got out, I haven't felt attracted to anybody since. Plus you two criticized anybody I was interested in before unless they were Caucasian and in the same town/city.
* That I'm a good for nothing money waster  

   * They hate that I actually stood up for myself and went to school for sociology and not become a doctor or dental hygenist. They force me to move with them from the city to this very small town with 0 job prospects in my field. Also I paid for university tuition entirely on my own dime.
* That I'm lazy  

   * I have chronic depression (diagnosed) and doing anything in this house is like stepping on eggshells now. I do the laundry and dishes ""wrong"", my art is ""crappy"", I own ""useless shit"", I watch ""stupid childrens shows""( Hmm yes Berserk, Overlord and Helsing is definitely meant for kids) and I don't have a full license yet because they won't teach me to drive and bitch at me for paying someone to teach me
* That I want to be fat forever  

   * They complain the exercise equipment and Just Dance is too loud and noisy and video games can't make you lose weight, I can't cook for myself because my ingredients ""go missing"" or my food looks and smells gross and meal replacements like Slim Fast are stupid. I can't go for walks because that means leaving the house and bad things will happen if I do. If I lessen the portions they give me, they call me anorexic and I'm not allowed to plate my own food.

There's more but I am exhausted. I've been secretly trying to apply to social housing or income based rent since theres no way I can afford 3k for a bachelors but thats hard to do with my parents eavesdropping on my phone calls and trying to access my phone and computer.

I'm not allowed to prove my parents wrong, they just start screaming that I'm lying and they're my parents so they're always right so I've stopped trying. I don't know what to do anymore.

If my grandparents still lived with us then it wouldn't be this bad but this new house is too small for them and my parents don't want them back so they got a 1 bed place.

I’m tired of it. I just want to be able to afford basic shit. Not even in a greedy kind of way. I just want to be able to not worry about rent or food for a second. The paycheck I just got was barely enough to cover rent. Literally had to get my best friend to loan me money to pay rent. Now I don’t drive, I Uber, and it’s super hot here and since I don’t even have any money in my bani I have to risk my health by walking 45 minutes to work and 45 minutes back. Last time I tried I threw up from heat exhaustion. And I have to do that now for two weeks til I get paid next. I have concerts I was so excited for that I might not be able to attend now because I can’t get to them. I have autism and one of the bands I was gonna see is my special interest, they’re the best band in the world to me. 

My roommate threw out all my food last week for no reason. None of it was expired, I’d literally just gotten most of them a few days prior. The fridge is empty. Like, besides mayo, syrup, and milk. I work in food service so I can get food there but like I said I’m autistic and certain foods are sensory hell for me which is 90% of the food we have and we’re almost always out of food I like so I’m just suffering. My stomach hurts and even if I try to eat the food I got from work I feel like puking because it’s so bad. I was denied foodstamps because my manager at the time wouldn’t sign. No government program will take me. I’m a trans man and on testosterone, I pay out of pocket because my parents cut me from insurance the day I turned 18 and I don’t know if I can afford it anymore and I’m miserable.

I just want to kill myself. I just recently broke up with my boyfriend of nearly 2 years and I’m starting to regret it. I don’t know if I broke up with him because I genuinely lost feelings or it was just dumb self sabotage but our relationship wasn’t too healthy in general but we really loved each other. All my friends are glad I broke up with him and refuse to let me go back. But I regret it so much. I relapsed into self harm last night. It didn’t even feel good like it used to. It just felt lonely. I feel so lonely. I have no one in this state because I moved here for my (ex) boyfriend. It doesn’t even feel right calling him my ex. I literally have no friends. I tried to like my roommate, I did, but there’s no communication between us and we just don’t have much in common at all. 

I don’t know what to do. There is not one single good aspect of my life. I recently made some really good friends on a trip but I could only be on the trip for a few days due to being poor, they’re still on that trip two weeks later having fun and rarely reply. My best friend in the world and I rarely talk because different timezones and I work whenever she’s awake. I think she’s found better people and is tired of helping me out with money anyway.

I’m tired of it. I genuinely see no reason to go on. I am not in college. I have absolutely zero interests or goals or motivation. I have spent countless hours on trying to figure out things I may be interested in career-wise. Nothing sounds good. Nothing at all. I don’t even know who I am. I look in the mirror and see an empty vessel full of nothing but sorrow and disgust. After I broke up with my boyfriend, who I’d been with since I was a minor and it was now my first time being single as an adult, I decided to try my hand at Grindr. Absolute regret. I am never touching that again. I literally think about what happened and want to break down. It was just a normal shitty hookup but it just was fucking wrong and I want to die even recounting it.

There is nothing left for me. I don’t know how to die. I’m scared of jumping off bridges even though that’s most accessible to me. Maybe a train. I don’t know. I don’t know what else is left for me. I don’t even have the money to *leave the house*. I am always 10x happier when I’m high (weed only) but I don’t even have the money for that. If I had insurance I’d look for a medical card because I’m genuinely a better and happier person with weed. But my state has banned weed as is. I’m so lost. I wish I was dead. I have tried everything to fix all my problems but nothing works. My parents don’t want me. My friends don’t want me. My cats don’t even want me at this point. When I go into groupchats or servers and say hi, I’m ignored. Even random strangers with common interests don’t want me.

What even is the point? I’ve been feeling suicidal and depressed since I was at least 9. It’s gotten worse. Every year they tell me it gets better. It has only gotten more and more worse. If I told 13 year old me in the mental hospital what I felt like now, 13 year old me would have just taken the whole bottle instead of being a wimp. I should have.

I (31F) have been married to my husband, Jeff (35M) for almost 7 years. Our relationship seemed fine even amazing for the most part and we have 1 lovely daughter (5F) until my husband bought a computer 5-6 months ago. Everyday since then he's been on that thing when he gets back from work even before. He locks himself in our study for hours and I can hear him talking and yelling while he plays. He doesn't even bother being with me and my daughter at dinner and asks me to bring it to him and he's careful to hide the screen from me, when he eventually comes back to bed he never wants to engage in sex with me anymore, it breaks my heart and makes me extremely insecure. 

Tonight I found out why. He happened to leave his phone while he was in the bathroom and he kept getting spammed messages from Discord (I know this is an evasion of privacy but please, I couldn't help myself) and I looked through it. Hundreds and I mean hundreds of messages back and forth with this random woman he was talking to for other a month and who he was being sexual with and sending nude pictures I had never seen myself, and with her he was so romantic like when we were first dating I was so jealous and disgusted. And there's another thing, they were sending pictures of their virtual characters having sex (I found out the game is VRChat) and he was spending money on this game and sending money to her with gift cards. When he came back I tried to ask him about it and it started an argument and he was blaming me for looking through his stuff without permission and I ended up breaking his phone and went back to the study, slammed the door and locked it. He hasn't left since and he wouldn't answer to my pleads.

Help me. What do I do? I don't want to divorce the man I love and break our family. I grew up with a broken family and I'd hate for my daughter to go through that.

2022-09-29 00:20:17,8,True,35,"My now ex boyfriend (28m) cheated on me (25f) a year ago. 

A year ago me and my boyfriend of six years were laying on the couch watching a movie. He fell asleep and around 11pm I noticed his phone started ringing and the name “E” popped up. I answered it and it was another man asking where his boyfriend was. My heart shattered. The man I had two kids with had been with this man for three years. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. We talked on the phone for 20 minutes and decided to text in case he woke up. We told eachother everything. He didn’t know about me. He didn’t know his real name. He didn’t know that he had kids. 

I wondered how this went on for so long without me knowing. The only thing I can think of is on Saturday nights after we’d go out he’d say he was going to hangout with his friend and smoke. I never questioned it and he never gave me a reason to not trust him. He was also private with his phone but he was always home after work and called me all the time so I trusted he was faithful and he made me so happy.

A month before I found out, we got into a small argument and he stormed out with all of his things. I thought that was quite dramatic considering we barely fought. Turns out he rented an apartment with his boyfriend and they moved in together. I think this is where he slipped up because he could no longer hide the fact he had a gf and kids anymore. His bf expected him there more often and called him more frequently which is how I caught the phone call. We tried to work it out but I kept finding out he was still talking to the secret boyfriend. 

A year later and he is with neither me or the secret boyfriend. He moved on to another man and now barely sees the kids who have no idea about his boyfriend. He hates me and says horrible things to me now. I think he resents the fact I found out about him being bi or gay and ruining his other relationship. I’m not sure how long he was going to string it on for. His new boyfriend hates me and after almost a year still hasn’t met his kids. He is so different now. He was such a nice person. Such a fun and involved dad. All that is gone. Now he calls me names and is away at concerts with his boyfriend every weekend. 

I am still so hurt and broken I was lied to for three years out of our six year relationship. I know you can’t help who you love but how can you do that to somebody.

2022-09-29 00:23:50,0,True,2,"For context: Everyone involved in this story lives several states away from me; I only know them via Discord. We’re all in our early to mid 20s. Names are all fake, for obvious reasons.

A close friend of mine, “Adira”, messaged me back in late January to tell me that she was leaving the friend group, but she wanted to stay in contact with me. I asked if something specific had happened, and she told me that she had been dating someone else in the group, “Freyja”. Freyja had been really toxic to her throughout the relationship, with things ranging from lying and giving her the cold shoulder to sleeping with “Archibald” behind her back (Adira was/is in an open relationship and was also dating “Beck” while this was happening, so while Freyja sleeping with someone else wasn’t technically cheating, the lack of open communication and Freyja having strongly implied earlier that she wasn’t interested in Archibald made it still kind of a dick move). Freyja eventually dumped Adira for Archibald, so Adira was stepping back from the whole friend group. I told Adira that I fully understood why she wanted space, and that I would love to stay in contact with her.

A few hours after that, “Newt” messaged me. He wanted me to hear Freyja’s side of the story, so I agreed to talk to both of them in a voice channel.

According to Freyja, Adira had pressured her into being friends with benefits, and then obsessively wanted the relationship to be romantic when that wasn’t what Freyja wanted. Adira had also apparently coerced Freyja into doing sexual acts that she wasn’t comfortable with. Those are the two main accusations I remember from her story, but there were a few more minor things that Freyja claimed Adira had done to her. Most of it just served to make Adira look mentally unstable. I didn’t really know how to process the whole onslaught of new information at the time, so I told Newt and Freyja I would keep talking to everyone and I didn’t want to pick sides.

The next day, in the Discord friend group server, Newt made a derogatory joke about Adira. Beck saw it. He privately messaged Newt to try to explain what had happened, but when he refused to hear Freyja’s side of things, he got kicked out of the group as well. He said some very hurtful things to Newt after that.

About a month and a half passed. A lot of people in the group were shit-talking Beck and Adira during that time, with Freyja leading the charge. I still considered both of them to be my friends, and Adira says I was the only person who ever reached out to her just to say hello, but I was conflicted the whole time. None of what Freyja described actually sounded like Adira, but since I didn’t know any of these people in real life, I thought that maybe she had just hidden a darker side of herself from me.

Beck and I played a game of Uno in mid-March. (He won significantly, iirc.) We didn’t really plan this, but after the game, we both ended up talking about everything that had happened. Since Beck had never heard what Freyja had been telling everyone, he asked me about it. I gave him a brief summary—that Adira had been sexually coercive and obsessive about wanting the relationship to be romantic. Beck, in return, told me what Adira had told him. In regards to the romantic obsession, Freyja had been flipping back and forth between telling Adira that she loved her in text messages and being cold to her irl, leaving Adira hurt and confused. As for the sexual coercion—Freyja had been the one doing the coercing, not Adira. So, Beck and I both realized that one of them had to be lying.

The day after that, Adira sent me a series of screenshots—text conversations between both her and Freyja, and her and Archibald—and I called her for a more detailed version of her side of the story.

Everything Freyja told me had just been part a smear campaign. Part of it was based on truth, just heavily spun to make Adira look bad. A lot of it—I still don’t know how much—was just outright bullshit. And, of course, part of it was the *reverse* of what had actually happened, like the coercion (I asked Adira about it; she said she didn’t bring it up because she didn’t feel victimized at the time. Still not cool imo, but it’s not up to me to tell Adira how she should feel).

…So I was the third one out of the friend group at that point. I just disappeared without telling anyone. I talked to Newt about it later since I wanted to stay in contact with him (I was closer with him as a friend than I was with the others), but I eventually decided to part ways with him for a while as well. I’ve reached out to him again recently, and it turns out Freyja had started being toxic to him and he ended his friendship with her. He’s now realizing he was lied to, and we’re back on speaking terms.

I’m typing all of this out because I still feel guilty for being so easily duped by Freyja. I’ve apologized to Adira and I think I’m actually better friends with her and Beck now, but I also think Adira let me off easy. I was never comfortable with any of the shit-talking, but I still stayed in that friend group for a long time, and I didn’t think to talk to Adira sooner.

So, let this story be a lesson to all who read it: If someone tells you that a friend of yours did something to them, and what they’re describing doesn’t really sound like something your friend would actually do, take some time to verify. Talk to your friend and hear them out. Or don’t, and just get your ass handed to you in Uno instead.",TrueOffMyChest,I fell for a smear campaign against my friend.,1.0,2022-09-29

For reference, I'm 15F, just in case this might be something everyone goes through.

This has been developing for the past 2-3 years, yet it's starting to affect my social life now. I have never told anybody, and do not wish to do so, simply because I don't want to cause any worry that could be unjustified. I'm not using a throwaway since I don't have any family or friends on this Reddit account.

24/7, I've noticed for the past year, and now I'm realizing signs beforehand, that I don't seem to be-- connected with everyday conversations, everyday life. It's hard to describe, and it's hard to truly explain to someone if I were talking to anybody right now. But I'm going to try my best to explain what I mean.

Whenever I'm listening to anybody or anything, I always feel calm. I don't feel much of anything, yet I still react the same way because it's how I usually act, and I don't know how else to act. It doesn't matter what type of conversation we have, whether it be serious or not serious, I don't feel much of anything. Even when I'm crying, or laughing, I still feel neutral.

The most I feel whenever I'm talking to someone would be embarrassment, maybe even a little worry, but even that seems like it's muted. It's not directly in front of my mind, and I don't immediately feel it, but it's more lingering at the back of it. Either that, or I feel it directly for a split second, before it goes away.

This is starting to put a strain on my social life; because whenever I'm talking with my now boyfriend or friends, it's hard for me to connect with their conversations or carry on the conversation. I feel like I'm somehow distancing myself from them, but I don't know why or how to stop it from happening. I know deep down that I love my boyfriend, but I just don't feel that burning sensation in my stomach anymore.

I don't know how to fix this or how to feel like I'm in the moment. If you have any suggestions or can relate me to some sort of experience you've had, please let me know. I want to know if I should talk to somebody about it, or if it'll pass on its own accord, if it's some sort of placebo effect I've created or a phase.

I’m on mobile, first time posting, wall of text. Whatever. 

When my husband (late 20’s) and I (mid 20’s) got together I knew his older brother had issues. What I had been told from my husband in our first year together was that his brother was an alcoholic and had previously beat ex girlfriends. My husband has always been honest with me and for most of our relationship has been NC to LC with his family. For good reason, but I was new to the situation and when we first got together I was reconnecting with my own family and kind of encouraged him to do the same. As far as both of us were aware of BIL had gone to prison/rehab/therapy and was doing well. He is now married and they recently had a child. 

Anyways, to skip a lot of background we are now slightly in contact with my in laws. This weekend we went to my husband’s family vacation house.

S: ""G when are you going to grow up?""
G: ""Excuse me? What?""
S: ""When are you going to grow up? Stop bringing your stupid friends to family gatherings and get a bf already.""

She freaked
S: ""Omg you're one of them?!""
I rolled my eyes.
G: ""S I've been out for two years, something you'd know if you'd actually show up at functions""
This was apparently the wrong thing to say as she went off. Screaming ranting and shouting homophobic slurs left and right. L is not from a big or loud family like I am, and  had became scared/uncomfortable with this quickly.
G: ""S shut the hell up!""
S: ""Don't tell me what to do you faggot slut!""
Finally I had enough.
G: ""Fine, then you can go to hell!""

1. I practically raised the kid during most of my childhood because since their divorce 11 years ago i've been his babysitter for literally any and every excuse my mom came up with. 
2. Even though the kid adores both his parents, my father has NEVER in 11 years left me alone caring for him because ""he's the parent, not me, and I shouldn't have to act like i am.""
3. My mother often pulls him out of school to move to new cities or countries but ends up coming back every time in less that 4 months bc she can't find a stable living situation, or bc she breaks up with her partner(s).
4. The kid is overweight, and it's increasing health problems for him, and his dad is the only one doing something about it. 
5. He spends a lot of time alone at home ever since I moved out, and she isn't looking for anyone to take care of him. 
6. My father and I stopped talking for 3 years, and still then, he would take responsibility in anything involving me, and never stopped seeing my brother, or looking for ways to reach out to me every few months. 

I know she loves the kid, there's no denying that, but I refuse to defend her, beczuse I love my brother too, and I know that our dad is very responsible w him and doesn't rely on anyone else to care for his kid. I of course, take him out every once in a while to the movies, restaurants, beach trips, etc. with my husband, but I can only do so much, and that is because I want to, not because i'm being forced.

TLDR: husband says sex is directly related to his mood and is upset that sex has been more difficult postpartum and seems convinced nothing will help even though we haven’t tried any of the obvious things that could help. 

About us: my husband (35m) and I (35f) have been together almost 10 years, married 2. Just had our fist kid a few months ago via c-section. 

I got cleared by doc a couple months ago to have sex postpartum. We have tried a few times, but it has been uncomfortable for me. He knows this. 

I am working full time (from home) and taking care of the baby full time, and the pets, and trying to keep the house clean. He does help around house: cooks, does laundry (mostly just his), helps clean sometimes, and sometimes the pets. 

He has been moody lately. I asked him what was wrong EVENTUALLY (after a lot of prodding) he tells me he gets irritable when we don’t have sex and we haven’t in a few weeks. 

It isn’t that I don’t want sex, we just haven’t figured out how to make it comfortable for me. I offered ideas for things that might help (more emotional intimacy, more foreplay, lube, trying other positions). He acts all defeated and says nothing will help. And he acted like my suggestions would be an enormous inconvenience. 

Eventually, he agreed to try ( though he is obviously not convinced we will ever be able to have good sex again). I guess he felt better about it but idk.

 I know sex is important but saying his mood relies on sex makes me feel like I am directly responsible for his emotional state. And that just feels like too much pressure right now. Especially since he is only borderline willing to put in any effort.

I like to consider myself a healthy adult woman who has had a somewhat sheltered upbringing, but nowadays am more comfortable with my sexuality + masturbating. But like I said, sheltered upbringing where I had to learn about sex from school + the internet and not from my parents, and I didn't even know HOW to masturbate until I was like, 18. 

I recently finally committed to buying a blue, bullet vibrator because why the hell not. I like it, it's great, and usually I'm pretty great about hiding it away, but today after I was done, I decided to charge it out in the open because I figured I would remember to put it away afterwards. 

I didn't remember.

Now I have an older sister who, like me, grew up sheltered, and never really learned much about sex afterwards. So this lady walks into my room, plops onto my bed, near the vibrator that I forgot, chats with me about what she was doing, and then goes ""Hey (my name) what's this blue thing?"" And internally I had a panic attack when out loud, I go silent because what the hell do I say???? And then she says, ""is it for art?"" And I say, ""yea kinda..."" before quickly changing the subject to distract her from the sex toy. I successfully draw her attention away, I'm feeling like the cat that caught the canary, especially after our conversation concludes at a natural point and she gets up to leave. And then this insistent motherfucker goes ""so what IS that blue thing?""

I am distressed: either I admit it's a vibrator, and risk facing the awkward moment when your sibling realizes that you masturbate, or I lie like a liar who lies. It's an obvious choice.

I tell her that it's for art (thank fuck she suggested this before because I would have had nothing to say), and is supposed to help with my drawing pad's pen. She asks ""how does it work"" and I feel like a criminal in the interrogation room. I handwave it, says it does something to increase the pen's sensitivity (lmao) and then shoo her out of the room. 

And I KNOW someone is going to say ""she is just fucking with you"" I can promise you, I know my sister, she is not, she doesn't get sex jokes, doesn't recognize sex toys, and is generally very, well, innocent, as you can see. I'm so happy that she doesn't use reddit.

Ultimately not a super big fuck up, but honestly I don't know where else to put this because I'm too embarrassed to talk to my friends about this but I NEED to share this story because LMAO oh my GOD I CANT BELIEVE SHE DIDNT RECOGNIZE IT and I understand that this is probably very common but I didn't think it would happen to me, because I am a FOOL

2022-03-19 04:24:25,5,True,1," Long story short, one morning, about a year ago, I took a baby bird from its nest and stepped on it. It was in this tree in the front yard that was planted when my family first moved into this house, it's been there since childhood and survived my friend breaking the bark, thunderstorms, etc. I felt guilty afterwards for killing the bird, but I ended up burying it to alleviate some guilt. The mother bird saw me do it, and after that no nest was rebuilt there. I figured she told her friends about it in bird language that it wasn't a safe place for a nest. I thought that would be the end of it, that all I would have to show for it was a bit of guilt.

Then comes March. Normally it would have leaves by now, even in February it should have been blooming. I wondered if the ghost of the baby bird was haunting it, refusing to let it grow in order to punish me. My dad thought he might have to get rid of it, which made me so sad. But then, he said it was still blooming so it hadn't yet died, which gave me hope.

I know it's not my fault, logically, and this is just my guilt. Which is stupid, I eat chicken and eggs, why should I care about a nestling? But I do. I used to have these horrible urges to hurt animals, but I guess I'm glad it was just a baby bird and not some bigger animal, I would've have felt even worse I bet. I don't even have these urges anymore, maybe that's why I feel so bad, I don't have these horrible urges to blind me from what I've done and I just have to live with it.

This issue has caused a lot of conflict despite our best efforts.

Of course these things appeal to me too, but it's very hard to enjoy while being frustrated about a lack of intimacy. When we do have sex it's normally in a very formulaic manner with a set of conditions (before bed, clothes already off, depending on what / when we last ate etc), and while I understand you have to be in a certain mindset to enjoy sex, it end up feeling quite dispassionate and not spontaneous.

We were a couple of horny motherfuckers, so I figured I’d suck a dick for funsies. In the interest of safety and privacy, we found a little side road that hadn’t been plowed, parked, and got to plowing. 

When the deed was done, I went to back the car out and the car was stuck in the snow. I drive a Wrangler with 4WD so we thought we’d be fine. We spend the next 45 minutes digging the tires out and laying branches for traction to no avail. I call my service provider for assistance and allegedly a tow truck is on the way. 

We walked up to the main road to flag down someone that could help and a nice couple with a truck agreed to try to tow us out. They back in, attach a strap and try to pull my car out. It moves about six inches and then their tires start to spin out on the snow. We disconnect the strap and they try to accelerate and now the two cars are completely stuck. 

We spend the next hour or so working together to get their car out. Eventually I went up to the road and flag down a third Good Samaritan who has an ATV with a winch which was unfortunately too light to pull the cars. Guy #3 is emotionally invested at this point and lends a hand with the digging.

Finally, after my boyfriend and I had been there for a total of about 4 hours, I flag down a fourth helper, this time driving a semi truck. With the six of us working together, we attach the semi truck driver’s chains and finally pull both cars out just after nightfall. 

Let this serve as a PSA on the consequences of horniness.

TLDR; I parked on a snowy street to give my boyfriend head, got the car stuck and a second car stuck, and had to be rescued by two men, an ATV, and a semi truck.

My FWB has been acting weird for the last month. 

For example a few things he will say when he comes over “you just want me for sex” “I’m just a booty call”

“When is your other FWB coming over” 
Just literally in my business about other men 

We follow each other on snap chat and he will question me about things i post or guys

He told me i hurt his feelings when i posted my male friend the other day but he will be alright 

He’s been doing this for a month. I didn’t pay it any mind until last-night 

He came over and he normally wears a condom. But he told me this morning he pulled it off right before he was finished and he finished inside me but he kept going so i wouldn’t notice.

He also told me that he wasn’t planning on buying a plan b and that we can name the baby “Elroy”

This happened three days ago, but the consequences are still ongoing. 

Context: I have been single for quite a while now. My friend “JJ” and I have been getting increasingly closer over the past couple of months and I developed feelings for him. I asked him out and I was (politely) turned down because he isn’t in a stable enough place for a relationship. Despite the initial awkwardness, we’ve stayed friends and see each other almost daily. I still have feelings for him and they just keep getting stronger. 

The FU: Being lonely, I did what any freshly-18 year old with no social life would do; I downloaded tinder. I matched with a guy I thought was cute, and agreed to go on a date. Somehow or another, we ended up taking shroom chocolate and did the “horizontal tango” for quite a while (everything was 100% consensual btw!). At some point during all of that, I caught myself moaning “JJ’s” name, convinced that it was him. I was literally convinced that my tinder date was JJ. Hours later, after the date fell asleep, I texted JJ. I managed to prevent myself from telling him everything, but I wanted to because he is the only one I really want.

The aftermath: Tinder guy wants a real relationship with me. Neither of us planned on hooking up on the first date, it just sort of happened. He wants to actually be a couple and do all of the couple things. JJ still only wants a friendship with me, however sometimes I can’t tell if he really does have feelings for me or is flirting. I want an actual relationship and Tinder guy is practically a perfect match for me. But I feel guilty as if I’m leading him on by continuing to hang out with JJ while I still have these feelings. I’m also not sure if Tinder guy noticed me repeatedly moaning JJ’s name…

TL;DR- took shrooms on a first date and moaned my best friend’s name during “NC-17” time. Now I feel guilty for being in love with my friend and might’ve self-sabotaged a potential real relationship.",tifu,TIFU by doing psychedelic mushrooms on a first date,10.0,2022-04-21

Tip for you because I did not know this and I don't think alot of people do: 
Apparently most standard tests don't pick it up so if you ever get symptoms but test negative ,specifically ask to be tested for Ureaplasma and please insist that they give you Moxifloxacin as most other medications do not fully treat Ureaplasma. (Ps this is anecdotal info from my urologist , I am not medical professional. If you think you know better, consider yourself 100% correct, I won't argue here.) 


Anyways, I have a collection of sex toys that I left sitting a container of dish soap, hand sanitizer , antibacterial all purpose cleaner , all diluted with water. It was a makeshift attempt at making some sanitization fluid because I couldn't find Isopropyl or Bleach at the time. I'm wondering if the ingredients in that solution are enough to clean those toys. 

They've been sitting in that solution for 2 weeks 

If this solution is not enough to be sure that they are safe, will submerging then in 70% Rubbing Alcohol and a diluted bleach solution for 24 hours or more be a viable option?

The girls I did feel more attracted to always out of my league. Anyways I hadn’t had sex with a woman since I was 17, but I brought a girl home from the bar last night. I got as drunk as I possibly could. Any time I’ve had sex with women, I always make myself drink a lot. I was worried about getting intimate with her and then not being super into it and calling it quits, so it took a while before we started. To be fair, I usually feel this towards men as well and take a looooong time before I feel comfortable being intimate with anyone. Regardless, not to be graphic about this but for the sake of context, I used my sex toys on her and I liked making her cum, but it wasn’t all that arousing for me. 

Sometimes I wonder if I feel uncomfortable being with a woman, as a woman. I always just wish I had a dick.

2022-05-06 01:23:41,3,True,0,"So I dated this girl for about 4 months, and I fell very hard for her. I thought it was going very well, and randomly after a date night we had I asked her if she was ok because that evening she seemed a little off. She broke up with me right then, stating that she just wasn't ready for a relationship at this point in her life, and that I was going to become her only source of happiness if we continued and it would turn toxic. She was also feeling jealous of my female coworkers and friends if I ever hung out in group settings. (I would always inv her to come to bars or dinner or whatever we did ofc). She has anxiety, BPD, and very bad past relationships with exes, so I asked her if there was any way we could try to work through it at all, as I would support her or be there to reassure her if she needed it, but she declined. 

So we went no contact for about 4 days before she reached out to me saying she having nightmares about me getting with other women essentially. Anyways we started talking again, and basically fell into this weird relationship that is like dating, but basically over text only. Its been about a month or so since we broke up, and she texts me regularly all day, and we have met up twice. Once just to see one another where we did the deed, and she repeated that she still loved me. Followed by last night, when she gave me a ride home from a bar and we made out and cuddled up where she told me again she loved me. We flirt heavy over text, but after the first time  we linked anytime I would try to see her irl she would say she's not ready so I eventually stopped pushing it. The only exception is to make sure I have a ride home if I have been drinking. But over text she still flirts with me, always makes sure I get home safe, and overall acts exactly like how she acted when I was her bf. 

She isn't ready rn to be a fwb, or date, or even just hang out as friends, and she told me not to wait for her to be ready to figure her self out. But we had both mutually agreed to cut contact if either of us started sleeping with/seeing other people. The problem I have rn is that I really love this girl, and I want a relationship with her, but I don't want to just text her like this. I liked seeing her irl, and being intimate. That's one of the most important things to me in a relationship. But if she isn't ready she isn't ready. I have had multiple opportunities while out to get numbers from women or have a late night rendezvous with them, but I declined because of my feelings for this girl. 

My problem is I fear if I cut contact with her I lose her for good, but the waiting for no guarantee of ever getting back with her is killing me. I don't doubt she has feeling still, but waiting like this is proving very bad for my mental health.

**TLDR; My ex broke up with me, because she is not ready for a relationship rn due to her mental issues and past relationships, but still texts me every day. She declines meeting up anymore, and the few times we have she reiterates that she loves me still.

TLDR: Our sex life is at dead center and my GF is sending me hints that she wants me to seek for sex elswhere to keep our couple. 

Vague ages, all you have to know is we are in our twenties and about the same age.

Our relationship is having sex issues: I want a lot more sex that we currently have (about once every two months). And recently, she's been dropping really not discreet hints that she may want me to have sex with another girl, for the sole purpose of releasing me of my urges.

By ""hints"" I mean questions like ""Do you think you could fall in love with another girl if your relationship is only based on sex but the feeling is good ?"" or """"""jokingly"""""" saying that she will allow me to have sex with other women if I need it so badly.

The truth is, I have literally no idea if this is a good solution or not. I can feel that this horniness of mine is sometimes intoxicating our relationship: the more I want sex, the more tense I am and I can become hard to live. But I fear that such a decision could really break our couple, and I really love my girlfriend. Everything is perfect in it besides our bedroom.

What do you think? Would it be a good thing for our couple? Would it ruin everything?

My bf(27m) encouraged me to work and take more clients because in truth we needed the money. At the time I felt it was the right thing to do for my family. Despite the sacrifice, now i feel neglected and there is this assumption he has that i am okay and can handle anything despite my telling him I am not okay.(he forgot our anniversary and increasingly dismissive). 

4 months ago i told him i might have depression and might also have damaged my back because of the lack of rest. Two days later while working and had to use his phone, i found a conversation between him and our employee conversing how I used 'depression' as a manipulative tactic.

 Till now I don't know how it was a manipulative since at the time of my saying it, i was just confiding in him and it took alot in me to do so and I wanted nothing from him other than being heard. ( after talking about it, he said he didn't mean it). 

Seeing he thought such a huge weakness of mine (depression) is manipulative broke me. I feel useless and almost as if all the effort i had given has gone to waste.

We almost broke up due to this but we decided to work on it. Its been months since and not once have we ever had a conversation about my mental health. Tonight I asked him why. He told me he needs to know how long I'll keep bringing it up ( the depression and the manipulation chat between him and the employee) and honestly, I didn't know what to say. I am crushed.


Question: How can i say he cares for me if something as serious as that (my mental health) was dismissed and labeled manipulative? How should i care for him if i know i cannot be given the same care? How do i belive when he says he loves me if an issue of my mental health was squandered with just one word 'manipulative'. How do i stay with someone who thinks so negatively about me that my telling them about my depression is labeled manipulative?

My spouse tried to end their life today. While I slept next to them last night, they took all of their medication at once, including several antidepressants, Valium, and a shit ton of Tylenol.

Then they had a seizure. Fuck, it was the most terrifying thing I've ever seen. I thought I was gonna lose them right there and then.

2022-07-15 02:57:40,3,True,1,"I'll start this off with saying it's not all of my friends that treat me like a sex object (obviously) but they are people I spend time with. My friend group has about 10 people depending on the day and every single one of them has either tried to date me or have sex with me, and that might sound extremely narcissistic but I assure you it is 100% genuine. It seems weird to explain without feeling like im tooting my own horn but i'd rather everyone thing i was horrifically ugly than the way i get treated.

I started hanging out with the main part of the group 4 years ago and others have filtered in and out since then. Every single one of them has told me they either had feelings for me or just been so blatantly sexual with me it made me want to vomit. It's guys and girls, not just men as one would expect.

At first it was fine, I thought they were just touch starved and I was the new person into the group so it was like an opportunity for them to date someone but as time has passed it's just gotten worse. The original guys who tried to date me now have since gotten girlfriends so they're not weird about it much anymore but they make side comments sometimes.

Now the new people in the group just talk about me behind my back apparently talking about how my body looks and my attractiveness and all the ""locker room talk"" that i've been spared the details of thankfully.

It's hard to just exist as a person and not as someone who is seen as an object to oggle, the women in the group talk about me and to me as if I'm a sex doll, and that just because we're all women that it's okay to touch me in places you really shouldn't touch someone without their consent and it makes me feel gross. They also talk about having sex with me and try to allude to it when theyre ""in the mood"" as if I'm automatically supposed to be okay with it being the same gender as them. It's fucking disgusting. I am extremely sex repulsed and it's just comment after comment and those chicks are worse than the guys.

I just hate being reduced to a walking pair of tits who's into ""guy stuff"". I'm super fucking smart and have awesome grades and I'm passionate about so many things and I know so much about my major and I have cool hobbies and i read so many books i want to talk about. I am so much more than what i look like but it seems nobody fucking cares that i have endless amount of knowledge about the things i love. i just want one person to be interested in me for what i have to offer with my brain and not my body, but at this point in my life i think it's not possible.

every single person that comes into the friendgroup ends up asking me out, i decline them, they join in with the rest of sexualizing me, it's the endless cycle of this stupid fucking friendgroup.

Honestly I hate to say it but I will most likely continue to hang out with these people as I don't want to be alone. Maybe it'll pass and they'll stop as we get older, or hopefully they'll start dating people and leave me the fuck alone.

2022-07-24 23:53:01,7,True,2,"Some background: Live with my parents (in their 60s/70s), still in college. Not my first intimate relationship (relevant later) my family (mother mainly) is very catholic, her family is “catholic” but very progressive in beliefs.

I (24) girlfriend (25) and I have been together for about a little over a year or so and I think we’ve been through quite a bit together. Things were off to weird start since we were pretty different but we learned to embrace those differences and make the best of them. Her things going into this relationship were to date for marriage and she want to be able to be friends with her in-laws, relevant later.

I was never really into drinking or going out much, especially late at night. My previous relationships were very reserved compared to this one but I enjoyed the experiences nonetheless. As time went on my mom disapproved more and more of me being at out so late, especially with a woman. She especially didn’t like the way my financials were going since her and I were spending a lot on dates and gifts (yes it was a pretty even split). She especially didn’t approve the idea of me having any intimate relationship before marriage so she was furious with that. We’d get into arguments of how I’m throwing my life away for some “street rat who gives herself to any guy.” I’d defend and say otherwise but it’s exhausting going back and forth, especially with family. GF and I have taken a small break because of these kinds of issues since I didn’t want to keep anything from her. Right now my gf seems really understanding of my situation and wants to make it work, saying things will work out with time and effort. On my end, after the holidays, an accident that wasn’t my fault and a fender bender that was, my financials haven’t really recovered but I’ve been working on budgeting recently to help myself. 

More months pass and things keep getting heated in my household. My mom’s gotten to the point where she threated to hire a PI to find out where she lives and make a huge scandal if I don’t break up with her, saying I’ve lost all my spirituality and self respect and I’m going to end up in the trash. My mom is also not in good health either. At one point, after an argument, I left our apartment trying to deescalate things and I get call from my dad 2 hours later saying my mom’s in the hospital for a stroke. My dad gets mad a lot now and blames me for all our problems now. I begrudgingly told my gf about this while when we were out. It came as a shock to her but after a long talk with her she reassured what she said saying she loves me, our relationship has been so different compared to our previous ones and she wants to make it work, saying we’ve been through too much to give up. The relationship from then on has been kept under wraps.

I don’t know what to do. I love this girl. I want her to be the one but things aren’t pointing in that direction. I love my family too and I don’t want to have issues with them or cut them off.

A few glaring red flags have popped up recently, the most recent comment being “will you spoil me?”

I already spoil him! I cook for him, he comes over for the weekends (he won’t take me on dates &amp; I have given up on it because the sex is really good) and I just bought an Xbox he set up for me - but didn’t buy any games yet and he really wants Grand Theft Auto but I hate that game and won’t buy it.

He brings me flowers almost weekly, brings me food (until I tell him to stop because it’s making me gain weight!), he’s fun to be around and we play tennis together. 

Lately, he has been really insecure and has been on his phone way more than usual when he comes over. The cons are starting to match up with the pros and maybe outpace the pros.

But the sex is so good - I want to start dating other men but still have sex with just him and keep doing what we are doing. I feel selfish posing that but something has to change especially since he doesn’t want to ever go out and asked me to spoil him when I already do! Maybe I should just break up with him…

So I was watching a movie with my male friend, Max (m/15) over discord because we are online friends. he says he needs to go trash something but i hear the toilet flush in the background.

I was very shocked and assumed he was joking. He wasn’t joking. He said he “doesn’t see the point because im alone in my room.” I was even more shocked and i thought he was weird so i called up my second male friend, Ivan(m/17). he said he doesn’t wash his hands if he’s gonna be home for the day. 

I was still shocked and started re-thinking all my relationships with guys. 

I remember a while ago i saw a video on tiktok of a woman who was disgusted by the fact men dont wash their hands. I pointed this out to Max and said to not tell his girlfriend in the future that he doesnt wash his hands when he’s staying home. I then started looking up these things and realized a lot of men infact, dont wash their hands in a lot of places.

Max says “Its not like im peeing in my hand.” I say that “hands have some of the most bacteria on his body” and “regardless he should still wash them.”

I am a female and most females wash their hands every time they use the bathroom.

After some back and forth arguing he tells me that im making him feel bad for not washing his hands after he uses the bathroom at home. He has some insecurities and i guess i added hygiene habits on to them.

2022-08-08 04:46:19,6,True,0,"So this happened 2 hours ago. Some background information, I have a work van that has a power inverter and the back is Isola from the front with a metal grate. It's not a creeper van, it is a fully wrapped sprinter van.

My gf is leaving for the airforce in 5 weeks so we have been trying to have dates were we have alone time before she leaves. We are both in agreement that we will not have sex anytime soon but we do make out still.

So we decide to set up a small TV and DVD player in the back of the van on the power inverter so we could watch the new minions movie. To my disappointment redbox does not have the minion movie yet so we got ""bad guys"" instead. 

We parked in the parking lot of an empty park and started watching the movie. Spoiler the movie sucks. So we started making out instead. Again, we had zero intentions of having sex.

All of the sudden in the heat of the moment someone bangs on the side of the van and they shined a light through the front window into my face and loudly said that they could see me. This scared the shit out of both of us and I hesitate only a moment before opening the side door and getting ready to defend ourselves if it were a bad person. It turned out to be cops, okay cool. Probably just checking to see why the van is running with nobody up front right?

Turns out that park closes at night and they inforce is stongly. But the cops also thought we were having sex despite us both being fully clothed and the movie playing on the TV. Long story short they ran our IDs and told us that sex in a public location was a felony but they had no proof so they couldn't do anything thank God. They told us it was still a misdemeanor but they let us go I guess?

We both have jobs that require clean background checks and watching this movie in the park at night almost ruined everything.

I understand that it really didn't look good for us but we weren't doing anything wrong besides unknowingly being in the park after closing, that's what's annoying about it. 

Needless to say this ended the short date and put us in a really awkward position. Fml

This girl has shown interest in me for about 6 months now even though I’m really not interested in her. She’s a year younger than me and isn’t my type in many ways, she smokes too much for my taste and she has a nicotine addiction which I don’t find attractive.

I gave her a chance a while ago after accidentally adding her on snap through quick add. We started hanging out because I wanted to see if I could find a connection buried down beneath. One day, I was hanging out at her house still trying to find that connection when she started getting too close for my comfort. I ignored her actions as to not be rude because I couldn’t muster up the confidence to stand up and leave. Eventually it came down to her on top of me and she stole my first kiss. I was beyond uncomfortable and I’m not thrilled about losing a precious moment like my first kiss with someone that I couldn’t imagine being intimate with. I never said anything to anyone except my closest friends and when I realized that they weren’t being supportive that I needed space. 

She had a background with being “intimate” with other guys too so it felt extra bad. Eventually she mentioned that she had an std weeks later and I realized she could’ve compromised my sexual health without my consent or my knowledge. I decided to ghost her for about a month and a half to allow myself to recover from the first situation and some other mental health issues I was dealing with. Within that time I bought 4 tickets to a concert for me and some friends. As the concert date came closer and closer all my friends ended up backing out and making excuses not to go and I soon realized that I didn’t have anyone to go with so I put out something on my story asking if anyone was interested and low and behold, she swiped on my story and wanted to go. 

I didn’t want to be rude once again so I decided to say okay to her. The concert was yesterday and we ended up going. She kept acting like we were super close and she kept leaning up against me and brushing up against me, making me uncomfortable again. At the end of the night I was pissed because I was the one that drove there (she was high and not able to drive safely and she was terrifying me.), payed for parking, waited in line, and she mentioned that she didn’t have any money for merchandise at the shop. Me being me once again offered to pay for her merchandise as long as she payed me back. 

After that whole night, I ended up spending $350+ on the whole night among gas, parking, tickets, merchandise, food, drinks, etc.. I haven’t received a dime for anything and not even a thank you. Despite this mistreatment, I really don’t want to hurt her in any way if it’s avoidable. To be frank, I can’t stand when people are hurt as a result of my actions. What’s the first step?

2022-08-14 00:44:12,2,True,0,"Hello there!

This is my first reddit post ever, so I really hope I am doing everything right.

I am thinking of leaving my girlfriend of more than two years, yet feel like a horrible person for doing so. Let me start by giving some background information:

We (me, 22M and she, 24F) met during my year abroad in a country that was foreign to both of us. We got along very well and got into a relationship pretty quickly. It was her first serious relationship. You could say the same about me, if we don't count a high school fling that lasted a couple of months.

Fast forward 10 months, she had just graduated from university and wanted to leave the country we met anyway for years. After my year abroad ended, she decided to move with me to my home country and rent an apartment there with me. She didn't speak the language and was not happy with the culture here either. Everyone (including me) told her, it was a bad idea to make a decision like that based on your first love. However, she promised me back then, she wasn't moving there ""for"" me, it was what she genuinely thought was best for her. I, in my naivety, belived that, though she has admitted herself now that it was mainly for me.

While I continued my studies, many things didn't work out for her (mostly due to insufficient planning or effort on her part imho). She didn't learn the language at first, didn't get into the university she wanted to and after a while was forced to work typical immigrant jobs. Now, she has at least a basic understanding of the language and a bit of a better life, but far from anything anyone would dream of. She has almost no money, couldn't do the degree she wanted to do and has to work a job she is not very happy with. She also worries about her visa situation.

I think she somehow blames me for her hardships or expects more compassion for it than I am able to have. This is one of the issues, slowly eating away on us.

Now, enough of background and to the main reason I want to break up with her: The sex is just terrible!

We were both virgins going into our relationship. In the beginning, obviously everything was new and exciting, but it started to fade pretty quickly. She has a very innocent (one might even say prudish) nature and refuses many things I (maybe being naive again) deem normal. She is also disgusted (her words, not mine) by body fluids of any kind. I have to admit though, that she was trying to be more opend minded about it, especially in the beginning of our relationship and has done things, she before said she would never do. For the past year, however, it has more or less stagnated.

We have sex maybe 5, 6 or 7 times a month and it is usually the same awkward procedure. I know she is mostly doing it to make me happy, which doesn't exactly make me feel better either. Mostly it feels like I was with a prostitute who was terrible at acting. It makes me feel bad beyond the lack of sex itself. It makes me question my masculinity, my attractiveness and her desire for me.

Of course I have talked to her about my unhappiness in this regard and shared with her more or less what I am sharing here. She made her boundaries clear and said that her lack of libido is mainly because of the state of our relationship. It is true that the more we fight, the less sex we have, which then makes us fight more. I tend to get quite cold as a response, in return she feels terrible. It is a vicious circle of mutual unhappiness. 

We also don't have much in common. Neither in hobbies or interests, nor in values or character. While she is an angel, who values goodness, compassion and empathy in others, I have very little of all of that and even regard it as weakness many times. Instead, I look for competence, power or intelligence as traits that make me respect people. I am saying this while being fully aware of how much of a bad person that makes me look.

I think that she is a truly good human being, that she would be a great mother and that she cares very much for me. If it wasn't for the bad sex, I think she'd be the perfect wife.

In the past months, the situation has gotten worse and worse. My thoughts are circeling around the following: I am 22, I have only ever had sex with one person in my life and, if I want to stay with her, will ever have that. An open relationship is no option for her either. In my school years, I never went out to wild parties and now I am basically living like a married 50-year old. In some ways, I would like to be more free and have fun, like I see many of my friends doing. Maybe the following makes me sound twisted and terrible, but I even thought of cheating on her to save our relationship.

We really had some bad times in the past months. I think of leaving her and leave it all behind me for good, but it makes me feel like an asshole. Not only would I be the person to prioritize sex over character. She also moved to a different country for me, where she has no one, no family and no friends, just me. She worked horrible jobs, just to be able to stay with me. I know I asked for nothing of that and am not responsible for it, but that doesn't change the fact that she did it all to be with me. And that is just the moral aspect of it. I won't even talk about the practical, logistical aspect, of the rent contract for our apartment or things like that.

I want to be wild. I want to explore my options and find out what it feels like to be young and alive, because that time of my life will be over soon. She is also two years older than me and time is merciless on women. I don't want to look back in 30 years and think of all the missed opportunites, like I look back to my boring and ""good guy"" high school years now. Breaking up with her also means to admit, that it was all for nothing. All the money invested, all the time all the love and all the blood. It might be my pride, but I don't really want to admit that (yet).

I also know that people tend to value sex less and less the older they get and I don't want to throw ""wife-material"" out of the window just beause of that.

I know she has shared this issue of ours with multiple of her old friends from where she's from, while I haven't talked to my friends about it much. I feel it is not fair to my girlfriend to make my friends know all of her private sex life. That is why I wanted to share it more or less anonymously here.

I created a burner cause I don’t know how to handle this situation. 

But my mother has always been physically and psychologically abusive and very manipulative. to my siblings and I and 3 out of the 7 children will not speak to her. 

She is currently in India with her new boyfriend where she’s being getting “treatment” for an ongoing panic disorder. I also suffer from this but I go to therapy and have learned techniques to mitigate the panic. Her being in India in itself is fine but this issue I have is there is an high functioning autistic 19-year-old, a 12 and 13 year old at the house, left in the care of my 18 year old sister who hasn’t really developed past the age of 14. As well has having her boyfriend in the home who is 20 and I do not know. I do not live in the house and I have 24 hour shifts for my job and I’m terrified something will Happen and I can not be there until the next day. And my other sisters moved out of state. She said she would be gone for a few weeks but it has turned into a month at 19 days. The kids are constantly anxious and they call me every day cause they pretend they are okay but I can tell they are not. They are scared there isn’t a parent in the home. 

While this situation has left my mother and I relationship in shambles because I told her it was very selfish, very manipulative, child abuse and neglect to leave kids unattended without a parent. After our argument my mother thought it would be a good idea to try to turn my siblings against me but when she reached out to my sisters it also took a turn for the worst with my oldest sister. 
The situation has brought up a lot of suppressed childhood trauma that has come out between me and my older sister who suffered the most abuse from my mother before she changed and learned beating kids is wrong. 

My sister confessed last night that my mom sexually abused her. and has watch porn openly with her in the same room. I am absolutely disgusted with this revelation and my sister asked me to not say anything to her. But I am super angry over it and I cannot believe this has happened and I lived in the same home as that woman. I’m absolutely lost and broken for her and my siblings who are trapped with a mother who obviously suffers from mental health issues. 

The other conflicting issue is that I would like to call child protective services and I talked to the kids about it and we have all agreed that it’s better for them and us to be able to stick together rather than to be separated and put in different homes. And out of respect to them and their wishes I have decided not to call the police but to do my very best to care and take care of them. The plan is when they become of age and they’re able to move out we are all going to get a house together in my name so that way they’ll have a stable living environment and I know that they are going to be okay.",TrueOffMyChest,Childhood abuse,1.0,2022-08-14

 After I was born, Bill decided he wanted to be a part of my life, but instantly there were issues there. I grew up knowing my dad as dad, but during my first 8 years of my life I was constantly told by Bill’s family how my dad wasn’t really my dad, and that Bill was. 

Well when I was 8, I finally pressured my mom long enough to spill the beans and tell me my dad wasn’t my real dad, and in fact Bill was. Seeing as I’m a spitting image of him, I shouldn’t have been surprised. That really mentally fucked me up. 


When I was 15, I decided to reach out to him and actually try and have a relationship. The first few visits were amazing! He had a wonderful fiancé, two step kids, and I could easily see where I got my sense of humor. Fast forward to being 16, I ended up pregnant with my first. I came up for a visit with him after I found out. 

Well, the first morning I got there I found out my mothers best friend had taken her life, I was broken. Right after I found out, I received a text from Bill. That text wasn’t supposed to come to me. Basically read that he thought I got pregnant on purpose to money trap my daughters dad (because every 17 year old is loaded with cash) and how I was slutty just like my mother.  Let’s just say he came running, trying to explain himself but I was beyond the point of wanting to talk, so I had a family member take me home.

 We mended things before my daughters birth, but visits weren’t the same. So anyway, since then there’s been lots of drama with him. This has been almost 11 years. I’ve had him tell me to fuck off because I couldn’t get him a vape and told him not to guilt trip me that he would go do something stupid without nicotine. He’s told my husband he’s worthless, told me I’ll never get anywhere. 

EVERYTIME I try to see the good, but he always snaps. There’s a musician who took his life that Bill really loved, and the other day I sent him a cool pic of said musician to which he replied “my idol I want to grow up to be just like him🪦”. He’s texted me multiple times telling me how I should reach out more because he’ll probably off himself once my grandma is gone. 

I’m constantly trying to go out of my way to see him and it’s always turned to hell if I don’t do everything he wants how he wants it, when he wants it. There’s so much more he’s said and done that’s just completely baffled me. I could never imagine saying anything he’s ever said to any of my kids.

2022-10-11 05:28:52,14,True,2,"I've come to the realization that, as a woman with little to no boobs, there's no way I can ever feel good about myself. 

I've always struggled with self image, as I never was conventionally attractive. But nowadays, that I've managed to force myself to be more ""confident"" and dress in a bolder fashion, I've noticed that it doesn't matter how much fat I lose, or how pretty are the clothes I wear, I will never be the first option of anyone when it comes to my looks because I simply don't have big boobs. 
It doesn't matter that I know how deeply some people have loved me: every person I have ever been with couldn't hide the fact that they liked bigger boobs, which I simply can't provide. I won't ever be like those girls they fantasize about, I feel like I'm not enough, and I feel undesirable just by knowing that they would prefer me if I wasn't flat as a board. Even if they tell me I'm alright like this, I know they're lying to make me feel better, and that makes me feel even worse. As if we all knew that I'm inherently flawed and not attractive by any societal standard or generalized preference, but they can't say it out of politeness even if they know they feel the same.
And no, surgery isn't an option because I'm poor and I can't afford to make this problem go away, so I'm stuck with always feeling like a lesser option, that thing people ""settle with"", instead of being actively chosen. 

I feel like no one will ever like me because of my body type and not despite of it, nor I will ever be the most attractive woman in the room as long as there's someone more gifted in that regard than me, and that's a thought I will have to deal with as long as I care about feeling loved and desired (which is something I don't think will ever change). I am tired of feeling like this, but I know it's just how things are. It's despairing to know I have no way to run away from my own body.

2022-10-11 05:32:08,16,True,1,"My partner and I have been together for 9 years and we’ve been incredibly happy, but specifically in one area of our relationship, we’ve often run into issues. He has often had a history with pushing my sexual boundaries. I also just so happen to have daddy issues from my narcissistic dad, which has left me with a horribly active freeze/fawn response that shows up anytime I’m nervous. The combination of him pushing my boundaries and me being too anxious to boisterously refuse him has been a recipe for disaster. 

We met when we were both pretty young and we’re also both each other first partner, so some growing pains are understandable. However this has been a reoccurring problem. When it first happened he started by fondling me a lot. I don’t recall ever giving him an enthusiastic yes to this. I regret not saying no immediately, but I thought it was normal to be nervous and I should just go along with it. After putting up with it on the occasion for a bit, I wound up explaining that him touching me that way was making me really anxious and we should dial it back. He apologize and stoped, but only for a few weeks or so. Then he’d kind of test the waters, I wouldn’t directly say no right away, and that would just start things all over again. 

This would happen on and off for years and years with varying degrees of sexual actions. I always felt like I had to do them for him to be a good girlfriend, and he’d often act very sad/disappointed any time I would imply a no, which often made me give in just to make him happy. I know it’s bad of me to not say no more clearly though, and I beat myself up about that a lot. I just always made myself push through it because I though I was just being nervous, and he would be happy/wouldn’t be sad if I did what he wanted. I thought it’s what I had to do to be a good girlfriend. 

And over time this lead to him sexualizing and objectifying me more and more without my permission. He would randomly grope me, spank me, fondle and finger me in my sleep, peek under my skirt, pull my dresses up so he could see my underwear, and say all sorts of degrading and sexual stuff to me constantly, regardless of the situation. I had to completely change the way I spoke because anything that COULD be turned into a dirty joke WOULD be. He would constantly bring up sexual stuff in non-sexual situations, like telling me how much he’d love to get oral, while we were just casually playing video games up until that point. One time he even absentmindedly lifted up my dress while we were in his living room, while his mother and 2 younger brothers were also in the room! It was slowly driving me crazy, and it eventually made any sexual touches or topics completely terrifying or me. 

I tried just pushing his hands away and telling him to quit it throughout that whole time, and tried more and more as time went on, but he never seriously did anything to stop or change. He later even told me that he thought I was just being “playful” when I would say no, despite me never implying that. I eventually told him as harshly as I could about all of this and he was completely horrified by the situation once reality set in. Later he said how “he though everything was fine” up until I spoke up. It came completely out of nowhere to him, even though I had spent months doing everything I could that wasn’t blowing up at him to get him to stop. 

Now he’s thankfully agreed to completely avoid sexual stuff with me which I appreciate so much. We do still cuddle a lot, but he doesn’t touch me anywhere sexual anymore, and we don’t have any other forms of sex. We still hug and kiss and hold hands too, I just am afraid to have any types of sex or have way too heavy of makeouts for a while until I feel safe to let my guard down again. The only thing is, I fear he’s falling back into old habits. Lately he’s been saying how much he misses intimacy, and how we “felt so much closer” before I told him how I felt. Or he’ll make jokes about how he “just wants to be loved” and these make me feel both terrible for making him feel sad, and angry that he still is trying to push my boundaries. I understand he just wants to feel loved, and I really appreciate all the effort he’s put into making me feel comfortable again, I just fear that he doesn’t truly understand the consequences of his actions and the trauma I suffered as a result, and that he’s just anxiously awaiting the day we can go back to having a hypersexual relationship again. 

So yeah, if there are any sort of communication tips or any advise anyone knows of that could help, please feel free to share. I’m currently going to therapy and have been for years now, however my partner never goes to any form of therapy despite me recommending it, and has told me that couples counseling would be the worst thing in the world, so that’s probably definitely out. So now I’m just left to struggle with the worry of if I’m in the wrong for not being loud and direct with telling him no all the time, or if I left this all happen to myself and I’m just being a bad partner by not sucking it up and going back to having demeaning sex all the time.

Also I never use Reddit so sorry if I’m missing any specific etiquette.

2022-11-01 20:49:23,2,True,3,"TL;DR : My boyfriend has been displaying countless red flags over the course of three months, including not inviting me to his birthday party and lying about it. I'm not sure if breaking up was the right decision.


Last week I (18F) ended my almost three month relationship with my boyfriend (20M). I met my boyfriend over the summer on Tinder and quickly became official after the second date. 

The first month was alright, although I did notice red flags here and there but didn't think much of it. For example on the second date he was teasing me, saying the only good thing I had going for me was my looks and other jokes of that nature. About a week later he tried getting in my pants at the beach after I explicitly told him I wanted to wait and he even agreed. I forgave him because I thought he was just making stupid mistakes without thinking.

 About two weeks later I caved and decided to have sex with him. He couldn't get hard and claimed it was bc he is used to masturbating without lube, and that feeling lubricant felt unfamiliar. That night he asked me if I could buy him a fleshlight and a bottle of lube, so I did. Coincidentally a week later his ED magically vanished. 

Around the time that this happened, I unknowingly went into a hypomanic episode (which later led to a Bipolar 2 diagnosis). The episode lasted for weeks and I subconsciously became really apathetic and cold. It seemed like I didn't care about anything. My boyfriend was the punching bag for those few weeks, and he figured I was just being a jerk to him, so he broke up with me over text. 

There was no legit conversation that was had about these issues before he broke up with me. I was caught off guard. I became very petty and texted him back saying ""enjoy your fleshlight"" which I then took a screenshot of and posted it on my Snapchat story, followed by a post saying ""ED moment."" As soon as he saw it I took it down, and he shot back with insults about my family and personal health. I did not take it personally and felt what he said was justified because I did something horrible. 

Three days later the hypomania ended and my psychologist became very concerned that I have had undiagnosed bipolar disorder. This was very upsetting because I destroyed my relationship while I wasn't even feeling like myself. I texted and called my boyfriend countless times about the situation over the course of a week and a half, telling him how sorry I was. He forgave me and we got back together. 

I have been extremely self aware of what I've been saying and how I have been treating him. In the back of my mind however, I was second guessing everything coming out of my mouth because I was worried I was sending hurtful messages. 

This time around in the relationship, my boyfriend was the one initiating more problems. He was making no effort to spend time with me or call me (I only get to see him at most once a week because of our schedules). Any free time he had was spent playing games with friends who he never had me meet. If we did call, he would make comments about going back to his friends as soon as I would leave the call or fall asleep on the phone. There was a point where we hadn't hung out in two weeks and he had not called me for 5 days. I felt really unimportant and called him explaining my needs and what has been bothering me. He claimed to have had no idea about this and was apologetic. He has also been sending really wishy washy text messages, and not giving me straight answers (especially when it comes to hanging out). It was almost as if he was trying to make me beg and plead for him to come over, it felt manipulative. So I called him to talk about that as well and he said he didn't realize this either. 

This behavior was fairly consistent throughout the entire relationship but increased once we got back together. What bothered me the most was I was not invited to his 20th birthday party, which happened to be on the same day of the week we typically hang out. I became upset hearing about this and he played the victim saying he walks on eggshells all of the time. His excuse was that it was a ""guys party"" and I would be the only girl there. Fast forward about a week and he confesses that I wasn't invited because he never told his friends we got back together, and all they knew of me was ""crazy"". He didn't want to be ""alienated"" by his friends because of me. 

I broke up with him on the spot after he confessed this, over text. I got blocked immediately on everything. He later unblocked me, saying he blocked me because he didn't want to see what I would post on my Snapchat story this time.. ouch. I take full responsibility for the Snapchat story incident by the way, however it was during a time where I was vulnerable and not taking the proper medication. I was surprised he used that against me. This time I didn't say anything offensive, but was still able to hold my ground. 

It is so hurtful to know that your boyfriend is lying to his entire friend circle about not being in a relationship, after he claims to have loved you so much. I don't think that's real love. One of the last things he said was ""I hope you're happier with someone who isn't a manipulator"" which I think seals the deal that maybe he isn't such a great guy after all. 

I wanted to incorporate him with my own friends by adding him to a group chat and he told me he wouldn't be talking in it. My friends think I gave him way too many chances, and I think they're right. What makes me so uneasy about this now is the role my mental health played in this.

I (24 years old) dated my coworker (25 years old) for 4 months. I had never been in a relationship prior, let alone ever had a crush, but we ended up catching feelings for each other. We hung out a couple times and those feelings only grew, but I was too afraid to ask her out because I felt like I had nothing to offer her because of my lack of experience as she had a lot of experience dating. However, one night (May), I walked her to her car after work and shockingly, she asked me out. That relieved a lot of stress, but added a lot of stress as I now had to learn how to be a good boyfriend.

The first month of our relationship was nice. I was learning a lot, but I was openly nervous about a lot. Especially when it came to intimacy and those nerves would stay throughout the course of the relationship because she would hug and kiss me at work and we would always have to worry about coworkers spotting us. But I worked through it because I liked her a lot. I would go as far as to plan out dates and make sure to help on her any of her personal issues. After a month, I asked her to be my girlfriend and she said yes. She would always remind me that she likes me the way I am and that she would be patient with me learning and that made me happy.

The next 2 months (June, July) were great. I met people close to her, she met people close to me, she was slowly teaching me how to get more intimate (she was down on herself in the beginning because she was a little rusty in certain aspects but I reassured and encouraged her), and we would work through each other’s problems. She would calm my nerves and I would be patient with her problems. We were both putting in effort and we both cared. We were very happy.

However, time came (August) to do something very intimate (you can guess what it is) and let’s just say that I was extremely nervous and I did a bad job and was super down on myself the entire night. I felt terrible and it really made me assess what I was really offering in the relationship. I felt like I was just “nice” and that’s it. She came in to lemme know that everything is okay and that she liked me the way I am (we never ended up getting to try again for the remainder of the relationship). 

August and September were busy months for us. However, September was important to me. Both of our birthdays were in that month. My birthday came first and she pulled out all the stops. I have never enjoyed my birthday more in my life. However, when gears switched to her, problems started to arise. She was stressed as she was also moving to a new apartment. I noticed this and worked even harder to make sure she had a great month. I helped her with moving, I even helped her friends move, and I pulled out all the stops on her birthday as well. 

Even though September was important, it was the worst month for me mentally because I noticed that she was losing interest in me and gaining interest for another coworker who we had just hired. That month, she was stressed, but she would be very dry with me and it felt like she was mad at me all the time. It got to the point where a couple times during lunch, she wouldn’t sit next to me and instead sat with the new guy (23 years old) and talked to him more. I felt like I wasn’t good enough and constantly compared myself (he’s taller, has curly hair, and probably more experience than me). Also, the new guy would know things about her that were never talked about during lunch. I noticed this and worked really hard to make sure she knew that I wanted her, but she was not treating me the same. I felt like an option and then I felt like a placeholder. I felt ignored.

Everything I did wasn’t enough. she broke up with me right in the beginning of October. She said she was frustrated with how much she had to teach me, she had no motivation to be with me, and that even though she feels like I treated her the best out of any partner she had, she felt like we were incompatible. This broke me. I never cry in front of people, but I cried a lot during and after the breakup. When we talked again, I told her I wouldn’t ask her to get back together (I never mentioned the new guy, but already knew so I felt like I couldn’t ask).

Only a few weeks after, she got with the new guy. I have caught them hugging and kissing a few times at work and it hurts to see. How can I move on when we still work at the same place?

Hi so this is quite personal but I’d rather speak to strangers about it instead of close friends because ig that’s not fair for my partner since he knows them all. 

Anyway, we have been in a happy relationship for almost a year and sex has always been good ! 
Lately, I’ve been struggling with depression and even tho it’s not impacting directly on our relationship, I can get more tense, hence more arguments, + I know seeing me ill makes him feel bad. hes been struggling with personal stuff too, so the amount of sex dropped a bit (still once in a week/ every two weeks ig)

Today we had an argument (pretty bad one, ended with both of us in tears) and when we went to bed (the fight was long gone) we started to kiss and he told me how much he loved me, he was super sweet. 
Then the ‘thing’ happened, and it was really good ! He seemed to be enjoying it too

But all of a sudden he just pulls out, kisses my neck, my belly, and just stops. He laid down next to me

I asked him why he didn’t finish (he usually always does) and he said that he just wanted to be inside of me to feel connected and close to me, and he didn’t need/want to have an orgasm and for the ‘thing’ to become more feral but then he told me that he had a really good time, then we continued cuddling.

I didn’t wanna speak about this to him because I don’t want him to think that I don’t respect his consent, and/or for him to feel any pressure in our sex life. 

But I don’t know if I should feel bad about this either ? I’m just wondering if it’s my lack of self confidence that’s making me worry or if there’s actually something weird there.

My brother kept saying we’ll pay you back at christmas kinda thing and gave my boyfriend a 100$ gift card, which was nice but I was taken back but didn’t say anything to my boyfriend or my brother. I think my boyfriend was a bit shocked considering how much work he did for him. 

Now my brother is hooking up to the city water line as he was on a septic system and asked my boyfriend to redirect/redo their plumbing. They already took up all the cement floor together and now my bf has to do all the plumbing. My boyfriend asked me if he thinks my brother will even offer him anything in regards to paying him because it is a really big job. I said i’m not sure and it’s an awkward conversation because it’s my family and i encouraged him to say something. 

Knowing my boyfriend won’t say anything, I called my brother and said can you please just offer to pay my boyfriend. My brother lost his mind called me a cunt and said he was going to block me etc. He asked why i asked this and i said i wasn’t sure if you’re going to pay him. Anyways he continued to yell at me. I apologized and acknowledged it wasn’t my place and explained that i know my boyfriend won’t say anything but it’s nice to just offer, also that he is doing this on his time off after working 10 hours days and on the weekend. It ended in him saying he was blocking my phone number and i told him I was going to tell my boyfriend and perhaps find a different plumber to hire and enjoy spending the money.

After a while he started kissing my neck and kept going down, every time posed and tried kissing my lips but I was refusing every time, after a while I ended up letting him do what he wanted as I was so turned up

He didn't get inside my as first he tried without protection and then when he found one I lied about felling so much pain he gave up and went to the bus stop with me.

2022-02-15 23:48:55,15,True,2,"Hey all, so two things happened recently that are making me feel that my girlfriend and I are sexually incompatible.

We've been dating for about a year and it's been great, we really love each other. We've taken things slow sexually, as we mutually agreed on. Currently we've only seen each other shirtless and touched over our underwear.

However, we recently talked and she said she wants to wait a few years before having sex. She said the concept of it makes her nervous and she doesn't think she'll be ready for a while.

Now, I don't want to rush into it either, but at the same time I don't want to wait a few years. I want to wait about one year or so, maybe even sooner. That's the first point of concern to me.

Also, I told her that I'm into pegging. 

**Edit: I didn't say this out of nowhere, it was very much on-topic with a big conversation we were having (too long to go into) and she's glad that I brought it up. It was very much relevant and I wouldn't have brought it up otherwise.**

I was kinda expecting it, given statistically very few people are into it, but she said she's not interested in doing it and the concept weirds her out.

Now I totally understand that's how she feels and I don't want to make her do anything uncomfortable (in regards to either topic). I'm not gonna try to convince her in any way.

I'm just thinking I might not be happy with that kind of sexual relationship. It's been going well so far, and I love what we have, but I just don't think I can wait years for sex. I also want to try pegging at some point. It's just a stressful situation and I'm sad that it's happening.

Are we sexually incompatible?

We've been dating for almost two months now and we had a talk with eachother about our boundaries and what we find ok and what's too far for us.

I really want to make this work, so I'm here to see if what I'm doing is wrong.

I know she probably doesn't actually mean that long and is just trying not to think about that stuff. I'm pretty sure about why as well because she told me how her friends painted a bad picture of it in her mind and her last relationship pushed her into stuff she didn't want.

Like usually, when she said no more kisses, I'd kiss her one last time before we got back to what we were doing, like watching a movie or anything else. But now, I've been saying ok, and getting back to whatever we were doing and waiting for her to come back and kiss me.

I worked my tail off to pass the physical test, written test,  and panel and chief's interviews and earned a spot in recruit academy, being the only girl in the class. I was beyond proud of how far I came after not making it past the physical test my first go around. I had nothing but good recommendations from division chiefs at the department and various other FF's. I don’t smoke MJ, but I use CBD. I've been a volunteer EMT for almost 2 years now and I've seen things the normal public never would. My family has a history of alcoholism so I stay away from it. I started using MJ initially as a way to deal with the horrible things that happen on the job. It was truly the one thing that helped keep me grounded and from spiraling downwards. I stopped using MJ when I realized I would have to take a drug test in a few months for the fire department, so I switched to using CBD. The CBD I was using was supposed to have little to no THC in it since it was from hemp (CBD from hemp is federally legal in the US). I had finished all of my paperwork and was set to start academy in two weeks when I received a call from the chief that they had to rescind my offer due to a positive drug test. After how hard I had worked I was and still am devastated that I could lose my dream job over that. I live in a state where it's legal medically and recreationally. The chief even told me how both their county and others are working to include CBD use into their SOG's since they have issues with their FF's testing positive due to CBD use. In my own opinion, I would hands down rather work with a squad that used MJ as it's vice rather than alcohol. It is still unreal to me that even though I was considered a top candidate I still had my offer withdrawn even when I don’t use MJ. The fact that even the tiniest amount of THC in your system can get you fired is unreal.

I’m posting this post because stuff has escalated but I’m so not sure. I know it seems like things but neither of us have said anything about it. 
So before he would do things like hug me, sit next to me to close it’s almost on top of me, show me things on his phone that’s right next to his “thing” which is very. Visibly excited and things similar too. I haven’t had the guts to ask him and he has still not said anything about it either. 
Things have getting wayyy crazier. Now we touch each other’s feet give leg massages, when he sleeps over we cuddle like spooning. We stick our fingers in each other’s mouth seeing how far we could get before gaging. We both vape so we shotgun a lot. In bed we wrestle messing around getting on top of each other slapping asses, grabbing asses, touching nipples. Licking each other. It gets crazy.
But one day I took him to a restaurant with other friends and we sat next to each other at a booth. And when we were all done with out food he put his hand on my inner thigh and just kept it there while we talked to everyone else. When I got up to get more food he also put his hand on the seat before I sat and started groping my ass while we talked too. He’s never done things like this in public. And now I’m really wondering are we somewhat dating or is this just horse play still and him being funny.

Edit: Well then this get a lot of attention. First I want to say that I know it seems obvious that he’s probably gay but you guys gotta think about my situation and how it’s really confusing. Though he does all these gay things he constantly talks about girls and fucking them. So I always thought he was just messing around with me like horse playing. But now I understand better with others perspectives that he’s probably actually gay and maybe it’s just for me. 
Second I want to say I now realize that his girlfriend is probably in the dark about all of this and now feel guilty for letting this get so far while he’s in a relationship and will talk to him about it before the next time we hangout or during us hanging out.

Update: So this is exactly what I was talking about. We hung out again and things got even more intense like mounting each other (with clothes on) and pretty much kissing each other’s faces. But I stopped it and had the serious conversation with him. I asked him if he was gay or anything and he said no I’m straight and I explained to him about all the stuff we do and he said” dude I swear I’m straight, if I were gay you would be the first person I would tell, but I’m actually straight, this is just some fun bro”.

2022-03-26 23:33:50,0,True,4,"It's mother's day in the UK tomorrow.


I am NC with my emotionally and physically abusive mother.


She moved away, came back to our town claiming sexual assault ( I don't want to victim shame but I genuinely don't know the truth) then moved back to her abusive ex, with my teenage sister in tow. My brother tried to get custody of my sister after my mum hit her, but that's another story, and not even the tip of the iceberg. 

For a long time I was angry, and sad. Why on earth am I grateful now? 

Because I have a three year old son, who she hasn't seen since 2019, and not because of the pandemic.


Because of the lies, I always endeavour to tell my son the truth, to within his capacity of understanding. 
The lies are countless. Lies about money, lies about terminally ill family, lies about herself so she doesn't seem as bad a person. 

Because of the abuse, if I shout, I apologise after. I take the time to listen to my son. If I feel angry, I leave the room. I teach my son that violence is unacceptable. 

During an EMDR therapy session for the abuse, I had a realisation that an 'accident' I had as a toddler wasn't one at all. I broke my fingers in a door. I remembered vividly seeing my fingers broken and our red washing up bowl full of ice. However during the session, I saw her face on the other side of that door, clearly seeing me and maliciously slamming the door during an argument with my father. That's when I started to question my past even more than I already had. 

Because of the neglect, I work so very hard. I have passed exams recently and have had job offers for better pay. Although my mum legitimately couldn't work due to epilepsy she was not responsible with money, our local social security aid is of a high standard but she often skipped meals or left me riddled with headlice because she couldn't afford treatment but claimed she couldn't see them (due to the epilepsy she's partially blind) 

. At 7 I developed disordered eating habits where I wouldn't finish my dinner at home because I was 'full', where in actuality I knew mum would eat what we didn't and I never wanted her to go hungry. 

I put her needs before mine at 7 and didn't really stop until 21, because her happy meant less abuse, usually. From 19 I financially supported her and paid months and months of her rent. (Social services moved me out at 17, again, a long story.) 
 She did eventually pay me back, but I never got the full story why it hadn't been paid. I only did it so my sister wouldn't be homeless. 


It's not all her fault, she went through horrible experiences before parenthood  
I understand her trauma was generational in nature. 

But she never got professional help. She never tried to heal. 

And she didn't do better. She often chose worse. 

Because of all this, and my paternal grandparents being incredible and giving me an insight and blueprint of how parents should be, I have done a pretty alright job of raising my son, and without knowing exactly how I didn't want him raised, I don't know if I would have the work ethic, the strong moral compass or the zero tolerance of violent behaviour I do now. 

So I'm grateful for every lie, slap, manipulation and tear I cried. Because the cycle is broken and hopefully, he's going to be okay, albeit a little spoiled. I do buy him toys sometimes, just because I can, and not for birthday/Christmas. 

Happy UK mother's day everyone. The reason I had to get it off my chest is because in town today, I saw the bouquets, cakes and candles and teddies. For a moment, my no contact resolve wavered, a pang of wanting the mother I needed, but don't have. The decent mother I could have been safe with.

2022-03-26 23:35:46,3,True,1,"Hi! So my (now ex bf) (M24) and I (F23) met 2 weeks later after (finally!!) leaving my ex of 3 years. That relationship was very toxic &amp; I’m so happy i finally left. i wasn’t really looking for anything when i met him(recent ex) since it was so fresh but i wasn’t opposed. Well when we met it felt like we knew eachother in another life it was such a great connection that i truthfully never felt w the ex of 3 years. We just could talk for hours and i really thought it was something special. So i know it wasn’t great timing and honestly the relationship was very rushed on both our parts. We started seeing eachother every single day and he even invited me to thanksgiving literally 2 weeks after meeting…? Thought that was alittle strange but i went anyway. Everything WAS truthfully great and i haven’t been that happy in sooo long. Aside from seeing eachother everyday, we got into the habit of constantly wanting to go out and do stuff like go to the bars or the casinos and out to dinner several days a week. Well i guess long story short he really became my favorite person to hangout with and even tho it was rushed it just felt natural with him. 

So how the knife thing happened was about 2 months into us officially dating. He takes adderall for work some days and he hates the feeling of it so his logic is “oh I’ll just drink to get rid of the feeling of adderall” after he gets home from work. Now we all know (I’ve been prescribed adderall since i was in the 6th grade, and he has never been prescribed it, his coworker will give it to him when he asks) but drinking on any medication never mixes, especially a stimulant &amp; a depressant. So the night of the knife incident we both went to dinner on a Friday night after work. He took adderall that day so u know what he’s doing. Drinking to try and not feel the effect of the adderall. After dinner his friends ask if we want to go to the bar, we said yea why not and went. Now, when he drinks on adderall he doesn’t know when to stop drinking or what his limit is. So we go to the bar and then it’s time to go home. I didn’t realize that he was drunk (idk how) but i was also drunk but better than he was. I didn’t realize until he gets behind the wheel to drive and about 5 mins in HES driving very slow And swerving. I get so mad at him that he would even consider driving and putting both of us at risk and at myself for not realizing or even thinking of the fact that he shouldn’t be driving at all after drinking. So we made it home safely thankfully and i storm in his house and go up to bed and basically black out. He stays downstairs and continues to drink. I wake up at 4:30am to him calling my phone and him being locked out of his room??? Now i don’t remember if i even locked it but i had to of but i don’t know why i would. Well i ignore the calls bc i didn’t feel like getting up and he finally gets in the room. I felt like i was being stared at so i give it 30secs and then open my eyes. I was correct, he was staring into my soul and he literally looks like he is going to kill me lol. So i just turn back around. The next thing i feel is a scratch on my back. I turn to him and go what was that and he said it was his “nail”. I had a odd feeling it was a knife so i feel around and notice there is a giant pocket knife in his pants????? Now, i had no marks on me but it definitely freaked me out that he just thought to *casually* scratch my back with a knife literally out of no where. I know he didn’t have any intentions to hurt me but it was just scary. 
I was going to leave after that but i had to be up anyway at 6;30am for work so i just ended up staying the 2 hrs. The next day he did send a giant text saying he was sorry and he wasn’t trying to hurt me and he had the knife bc that’s how he opened the locked door but still.

I am no longer with him, i ended up telling his mom and then his mom got way too involved &amp; said we are too volatile together and was telling me to breakup with him. I loved his mom she was like a mother to me but she even said he is a mommas boy and she got into his &amp; I’s head too much after i told her so i distanced myself for 2 weeks and then he ended up breaking up with me a day before my bday while i was going to do it the day after so my bday wouldn’t get ruined. The breakup was very mutual and we ended on great terms and still ended up spending my birthday together. 

I feel like our connection was like a soulmate tie and it really did feel so special. I’ll say this to anyone that I’ll always have love for him even tho it was only 4 months spent together. I saw him out last night after about 3 weeks of not much contact and it was like time never passed. I miss him so much and it hurts knowing our connection is so strong but the timing is bad. 

What are your thoughts on what i should do, move on or try to give it a second go eventually (he did say he’s not ready for a relationship yet again bc he has a lot to do for work &amp; he’s been in a bad place) :/",relationship_advice,Boyfriend *casually* slides knife across my back..?,2.0,2022-03-26

Edit: I think I've answered my own question. I think it's because there's an industry for it so lots of marketing whereas there's no powerful group marketing for women to start having natural hair (some feminists stop shaving and accept others doing so but there isn't like organized promotion to stop shaving) 

Basically, clothing trends and hairstyle trends change constantly, meaning every year or few years or so.

Leg hair in particular has no legitimate basis to be deemed unhygienic (while I can understand why for hygienic reasons some women may opt to shave their armpits or pubic hair)

So why after decades and decades has it remained a norm for women to shave their legs? I feel quite comfortable with unshaved legs, but I know many people think this is not ladylike, attractive, or even clean (which again there's no basis for). Will leg hair in particular ever come back in style in the U.S.? Or armpit hair, which some women are embracing but most don't?

Obligatory apology for formatting, I’m on mobile, sorry. 

Anyway, the story begins with a buddy of mine convincing me and some other friends to join a wing eating competition at a local restaurant. I think it’ll be fun and at absolute worst I get all I can eat wings for the entrance fee of $10. The competition is set up so each contestant gets a tray of 100 wings and the owner weighs the tray before and after to see who ate the most. So the competition rolls around and I’m relieved to find out that they’re using their mild wing sauce (I can’t handle spicy food well at all) and I’m kinda hungry so I’m ready to go. 

The competition starts and around 10 minutes in I start feeling a little kick from the sauce but it’s still enjoyable even though I know my trip to the bathroom later might be kind of uncomfortable.  I keep going, partially because mama didn’t raise no bitch, and partially because I thought I might actually have a shot at winning. Well, the competition ends and I end up in a 4-way tie for second place after eating 2 pounds of wings. Only after the fact did a friend of mine decide to let me know that most wing sauces have dairy in them… I’m lactose intolerant. 

So I hear the news, snag my free t-shirt, and haul ass back to my apartment to pound some lactaid pills in some sort of hail-Mary attempt to not shit my brains out for the next 3 hours, and to my surprise, it worked. I slept like a baby and woke up today, still feeling a little full, but fine otherwise. Then, my stomach rumbles. I jump out of bed and clamber my way to the toilet where I proceed to push the fires from the deepest circle from hell out of my asshole. I finish my business, and wince a little while wiping, and look down into the toilet to see, maybe, four little nugs just sitting in the water. It’s not even close to being over. So far I’ve gone maybe five or six times and it just never seems to end, each run to the bathroom is worse than the last. My poor asshole hasn’t had any time to recover and there doesn’t seem to be an end in sight.

So as I’m sitting here again on the toilet I’m begging you Reddit, please give me any type of advice to make my asshole stop burning like a thousand suns.

Please see post history for more background. TL;DR I had misgivings about my husband, ""Ethan"", going to a bachelor party a couple weeks back because I was in the middle of miscarrying.

He was still planning on going as of dinnertime the day before the full-day event. 

He still won't say he resents me for it, but he admits he was very disappointed when he eventually didn't go because I experienced a lot of pain and a large amount of blood loss (6 ""regular"" pads in one hour) in gushes, and he took me to the hospital that night. 

He texted his friend ""Ken"" and the bachelor ""George"" that night he wouldn't be able to make it because I was in the hospital and we didn't know at that point if they would need to keep me or send me elsewhere or what. 

Ethan told me his friends were giving him shit for it. I learned tonight that Ken called him whipped and said that it was just an excuse not to go. 

Fortunately, I guess, I had good enough blood pressure and I apparently went through the worst of it at home (before any painkillers had kicked in... oh @#&amp;+ that was awful) so when the doctor came in to examine me, he removed a few mid size clots that he could see and gave a prescription for an injected painkiller and rotating doses of over the counter painkillers every 3 hrs at home. I continued to have massive cramps and gushes of blood for 18ish hours after that but most of the blood and the embryonic sac had passed. It was comforting to have my husband home with me even though he could not hide his disappointment and he didn't want to talk about it. 


Ken in short order started talking about *his* bachelor party. Ken and his wife married in 2020 and his original trip (that did include my husband going to Vegas) was cancelled because of Covid, so they had credits towards another trip that Ken has decided he wants to use this September. I also feel like a lot has happened in the last two years and this trip is awfully selfish and unnecessary.

This is where I might be the asshole.

I desperately want to chew Ken out for multiple reasons- first and foremost I think this trip is stupid and selfish and unsafe, but also because he is currently planning this trip for when their second baby is barely 3 months old, he is demanding answers from everyone already (2 weeks after announcing it) while it is a (minimum) $3K each person trip now due to the date and just essentials like food, not to mention the activities he wants to do, and finally for being a shite friend because of how he treated Ethan when I was actively miscarrying and my husband decided to stay with me- even though he really wanted to go and paid for his half of the room.

The first date had gone well and I had a really good time as I believe did she. I felt like she was a likeminded person and very likeable and attractive. The second date was on a rainy day so we decided to watch a movie and go see the sunset. Everything starts going well and we start cuddling during the movie. We leave to watch the sunset but manage to miss it. Regardless we sit on the beach and talk for a while. We decide to go back to my place to eat and chat. At my place we start another movie and cuddle through it. She was tired so I offered for her to stay over. We start cuddling and fooling around in my bed. (Note: I am not a virgin but inexperienced regardless.) Somehow I manage to fumble at this point and it leads to nothing. But this isn't even the worst part. We sleep through the night and in the morning we start cuddling again and then more fooling around. After a while she literally gets on top of me and we fool around for a while but it manages to lead in to nothing. I did try to escalate it but maybe missed a couple necessary steps so it again leads in to nothing. I knew it could have led to something more but just thought she just wants to fool around and nothing more. Then a day later I realize how oblivious I had been. Obviously I do not know for sure if she wanted to actually have sex or not but later that day I realized how oblivious I managed to be. Now I have a feeling she might not be interested in seeing me again as I am a bit oblivious. Which is unfortunate because I thought she was a genuinely fun and a good person.

I hate having to remember that basically I’m supposed to “stop acting like a kid” when I’m not even 30 or fucking 40 yet and even though my own parents certainly still behaved “young” around that age. I hate having to pretend I’m happy with hastily, half-assed efforts to do something “special” for this terrible fucking day of the year. But most importantly, I deeply, really, truly, down to the deepest part of my soul *hate* having absolutely no fucking way of avoiding it.

I hate having to act like I enjoy my birthday. I hate the gifts I get because they’re either things like a fucking tool set, which I don’t need because I already have my own already damnit, but have to be like “oh wow yay a fucking drill! Because there’s not already a mountain of shit I already have to do!” Or best case scenario I get a gift I actually enjoy like the smallest, new Tv that could possibly be bought or God forbid I enjoy a new video game, comic or little something like a figure of my favorite sci-fi or game franchise. You know, because the world would fucking end of I actually got something I enjoyed over yet another fucking gut punch gift that may as well come with a banner introduced with confetti that says “We expect you to enjoy being an unwilling selfless servant! Now get to work!” No, clearly my problem is that I need to be thankful for that $10 gift card to Home Depot that will literally buy nothing you got me. Clearly, rather than just giving me that $10, it was better to give me something we both knew would be more useless than a key hook on the inside of a car.

My birthday clearly isn’t for me so why the fuck do I have to participate? Find someone else if it’s just another occasion to passive aggressively remind someone about your personal views on how they’re not “mature enough” as an adult. Because apparently having a life crushing, soul draining job where I literally have to listen to people piss and moan about their problems all day for a living, dealing with a mortgage and trying to form a family isn’t “adult” enough. Guess I’m immature for not wanting to behave like I’m 60 for the next 50 years of my life.

These people only want to ask about “how’s work?” “Were you able to cover the bills?” Groceries, gas prices, *their* fucking old people habits. But the *second* I deviate from that and want to speak about something I actually enjoy I’m treated like I’m an invalid, immature, or a child that doesn’t know any better at best. Because God forbid I have any interests outside of my responsibilities or obligations. 

Every day I’m made to feel like I’m a child because I happen to just *like* Star Wars or want to spend an afternoon gaming to unwind for the sake of my fucking sanity because the world seems designed to drive people batshit crazy and it just so happens that I wound up with a family that basically expected me to only want to drink scotch, read some asininely dull, boring, and strangely political books - as a gift - before and ever since I graduated University! I cannot stress how much I dearly, down to my core, despise being given books on subjects I just could not give a fuck about (not the Bible, as oddly the one thing I can say is that while I’m religious my family at least isn’t one of those constantly Bible thumping, pulpit smacking types). But it’s apparently so bland and boring for them to know I have any interests that aren’t about living like a geriatric retiree that’s just up to date with their history channel, drinks obnoxiously odorous coffee 5 times a day and because I don’t spend every free waking second on some yard or wood related project BECAUSE MOTHER FUCKER!!

Now she’s not the issue.

The issue is, she has a brother who is nineteen. I am 21F for reference. We both are (his sister and I). Her brother and I started spending a lot of time together over the past few months. We both ended up really liking eachother, and one night we got drunk and we ended up hooking up. We have been seeing eachother secretly for the past few weeks.

I’m worried that if I tell her, and it doesn’t end up working out it could ruin our friendship. Like even if it didn’t work out now, I could see it potentially working out in the future, which I’m totally okay with. I’m also worried about how I would tell her. Her brother and I have discussed options on what we should do, but none of them seem right. The reason why I’m not telling her isn’t for malicious intent, it’s more along the lines that she is quite literally one of the best people you will ever meet. I’m worried if I tell her, she might never talk to me again. And it’s not like I just wanted to hookup with her brother, I developed actual feelings for him over the past few months and they’re mutual from both our ends. One thing led to another, and I’m going to be honest. I didn’t want to tell her I liked him before we hooked up, because what if I caused all this drama and we just didn’t have chemistry or the sex was bad, and then we didn’t end up talking and I made a big deal over nothing. I also can’t tell her oh we stopped talking because the sex was bad or there was no chemistry…it’s her brother she doesn’t want to hear that.

I like him a lot and as time goes on I’ve realized I do want to be with him, but I’m scared of losing my best friend. I don’t know what exactly is the best way to tell her because again I don’t want her to think I was deceiving her or going behind her back etc. It’s not like that. I just wanted to make sure. I’m also worried about the fall because he’s going back to college out of state, and I just graduated and I’m working. So I don’t even know if it’s going to work out by then. But I’m also worried about telling her, getting her whole family involved when I love her mother and father/siblings, and then it not working out.

Childish if you ask me but you know every relationship has its hardships. This is all just so chaotic. But anyways I went to go visit my boyfriend last weekend ( did I mention we’re also long distance ?) we decided to go hangout with a couple of his work friends. We all had a good time, i myself had way to much to drink, but rightfully so since we had a reliable DD. By the time we made it home to his friends house I was almost completely incoherent and by grace of god I made it upstairs and plopped down onto the bed. I had basically zero concept of time but a little while later he came into only to find that I had thrown up an entire subway footlong on his coworkers guest bed. I don’t remember him cleaning it up but I know he did. When he was done I can only assume he turned off the light. He got me undressed and r**** me. I remember it in bits and pieces since I blacked out but I remember how uncomfortable my body felt. How worried I was that I stunk from my vomit or sweat from being in the club. I was worried … i was in now way aroused. I was so dry it’s a wonder how it even happened I was probably completely limp. Anyways enough of the brutal details just know I remember physically resisting as much as I could but I think he just hushed me or ignored it entirely. So this all happened on a Friday night. I finally got the courage to text him about it on Tuesday and really confront him. He immediately wanted to call me. He sobbed on the phone to me for hours apologizing as he knows I’ve been sexually assaulted already more than once and one of the ways it happened was exactly how he did it. For some reason I was comforting him telling him I love him &amp; forgive him and I know he’s a good man. He said he wasn’t thinking about it in that way he said that to him it was like a normal day. He was also drunk. I just have no idea what I’m going to do long term. I’m so conflicted. I’m the type of person that once I hear a hint of remorse I can forgive practically anything.

2022-08-12 00:56:10,1,True,1,"Hi everyone,

Currently going through an interesting situation with one of my “friends” (I’ll explain quotations later) and was really looking for some advice and insight as I no longer know how to navigate this friendship or the next step I should take.

So, I have a friend, that I’ve know for a few years now (20s M) and we started off pretty well. He seemed chill and goofy, was there for me when I needed him and overall became a pretty good friend for me despite some of his problems. But even with that, I kinda have this weird uncomfortable feelings humming in the background. I pay mind but don’t act on them.

Lately, as the years have gone on, his problems seemed to have gotten worse. Some extreme situations happened and I notice his behaviors have taken a turn for the worst. I notice he has really bad coping mechanisms with his stress and instead of opening up and confiding in friends for help, he instead becomes very toxic and inadvertently pushes away his friends as he reveals he purposely “acts out” to make a scene, to antagonize others just to get reactions out of them and overall turns a very normal and innocent conversation about video games and shows about wanting to h*urt himself or how everyday is bleak to him.

It all started to leave a very sour taste in my mouth with him. He was starting to ramp tensions up with the others in the group we had and eventually his behaviors started to get to me where I felt angry and drained just watching him interact with others.

Last year, I came to the realization that I needed to cut this friend off. He was becoming too much and it just seemed like he cared more about getting attention by acting out rather than getting help he clearly needs. 

It was extremely painful for me but I kicked him from the group and told him that I needed to end communications here. He wasn’t happy about it but he left it like that.

Couple of months, he shows up at my house with a gift for me, which was sweet, but again left a sour taste in my mouth as it then felt like he was trying to buy a friendship now. I kept the gift, but I feel weird about having it. He explained he was in the middle of a really bad point in his life also.

Ever since then, for the last half of a year, he’s been reaching out and trying to hang and stuff but I can’t bring myself to text him back. I just have this icky disgusted feeling. I feel terrible because I want to be his friend, but at the same time I feel like our friendship has ran it’s course and he can’t take the hint. I don’t initiate texting him because I don’t want too open that conversation because I don’t even know what to say to him anymore. 

I’ve never had this feeling in any of my friendships. I’m lost on what to do or how to navigate this. He’s very mentally fragile so I don’t want to be too harsh on him, but I don’t want to be too soft either.

How would I navigate this situation???

2022-09-09 22:56:40,21,True,1,"
I’m very confused by my boyfriends behavior. He has these rigid gender roles in his head and shames me for stepping outside my “gender role”. He says it is because my sex drives is too high for a woman which means I’m supposedly prone to promiscuity, he says I’m too straight forward, confident, Etc. His attitude towards women including me resembles much of the pick up artist stuff. He was abusive towards me on many occasions, including emotional and sexual. 

He puts women only in two categories: “good women” and “bitches” and his opinion of me always oscillates between “good woman” and “bitch”. But I love him so much. I have the impression that he only cares about my looks and wants me to be as sexy as possible and then puts me down for not being like “innocent and natural good girls”.


But apparently, this rigid gender role doesn’t apply to him. He now decided to wear only women’s clothes, to date men (pushes me to make our relationship polyamorous), he wants everyone to understand that “men have soft sides,too”, Etc. He once wanted to break up because he decided he was gay, then begged me back again because he had this epiphany that he was bi, then hurt my feelings by saying that men are more fun in bed, Etc.  What do you think is going on? Is the soft boy persona only an act to appear innocent? Or is he very confused about himself?

Also: I am aware that I will get many confused comments because of the fact that he was abusive towards me and I still love him. I tried to leave him numerous times but apparently I’m trauma-bonded to him and stuck in the cycle of abuse. My abusive childhood apparently conditioned me to think that love is something to be earned and that it should be very painful.

2022-09-09 22:58:03,1,True,1,"I have been living with my baby daddy since late 2019 after I met him at his school one afternoon. He is my first and only lover. It was the classic boy saves girl from a shitty home life and shows her the world except for the world was his four bedroom walls and roaming the streets at night. Now don’t get me wrong I loved every day, I’d sneak to his place early in the morning and we’d hid me there till our parents caught on over and over again till they gave up on trying to stop us. We ran from the cops, we got drunk, we partied, we did some crazy stuff. There was the summer of 2020 where we went to the beach almost everyday 
with our friends. 

But every relationship has its flaws and we both screwed up in our own regards. Anyway we started dating in December 2019 and he dumped me in August of 2020. However we continued to live with each other and if he tried to push away I’d hold on the him and then if I gave up and pushed away he’d hold on to me so we were in a constant relationship tug of war. It is relevant to mention that after he dumped me I consistently saw him texting or sexting or flirting with other women even so far as going back and fucking his ex and other women, leaving me at his house or dropping me off somewhere so he could have dates etc. I know this is a long post but bear with me because I have to explain what we’ve been built from. 

Last summer (2021) I found out I was pregnant and we moved to a different province with his parents but not before he rekindled a friendship from years back. It was someone who he’s apparently been desperately in love with since he met her and he decided to try things with her. Long story short it didn’t work out and we are now living in our own apartment with our 9month old son and she is not spoken of, however I know she’s still on his mind. We have a lot of trust issues and other issues obviously because of everything we’ve done but we continue to try and make it work for each other and for our son’s sake. 

But recently it’s become more difficult to be physically or mentally intimate with my partner. I find myself not responding or moving away from him when he reaches out to me. I rarely want to have sex anymore and half of the reason I do it is because I’m worried that he’ll go do something with someone else if I don’t satisfy him often or well enough. I used to watch him walk into to the room and I’d smile or we would cuddle and I’d feel loved and safe in his arms but now, every time he does anything I can’t help but wonder who the last woman he thought about doing this to was and how many people are getting the same complements that I am. I never let myself consider the thought of leaving him because I believe anything can be overcome with time and love and effort and I also believe in soul ties and I’m terrified of having to go out into the world and find another partner but in recent weeks I’ve just become exhausted.

2022-11-10 19:10:28,2,True,3,"I (25F) grew up in a big family with 4 brothers and 3 sisters all older than me. I had a pretty normal childhood, stable life, good schooling, present parents, everything. My problems started when my older siblings started having kids. There’s a particular brother of mine let’s call him G (34M) that I always feel uncomfortable being around my nieces. I don’t why but everytime I see him alone or playing with my nieces I want to take them away from him immediately. My brother doesn’t do drugs nor does he display any predatory behavior but I can’t help it. This doesn’t happen with any of my other brothers. Only him.


I started wondering why I would feel this way about him considering the fact that he has never done anything to me or anyone I know, till I realized that I have very vague memories from when I was age 6/7. I found this weird cause I have a lot of memories from when I was age 2/3 and my memory should be better at age 6. This got me thinking that maybe he did something to me at that age that I can’t quite recall and seeing him with my nieces who are about same age triggered something repressed.


I have tried everything to remember what happened but nothing is working. I can’t confront him, I can’t tell my family about something I don’t remember, how would I even bring it up. I have tried talking to my other siblings about our childhood to see if anything stands out but they remember it exactly how I do; just a normal big family.


I keep wondering if therapy would help, it’s quite expensive here and what would I do if I went to therapy and did remember. Would I tell my family? Would they believe me? What would the fallout be? My family is great we are close, see each other pretty much every weekend, take vacations together. A happy family, how can I ruin that? Is it better not remembering? Should I leave it alone? 


Also My brother has a long term girlfriend and they plan to remain kid free so it’s not a concern that he would do something to his kids. And I do talk to my nieces about safety and what to should anyone try something on them at home, school or anywhere, so I’m sure they would speak up if anything happened. I also keep wondering if his past has anything to do with him choosing to remain kid free or maybe he was just a hormonal teen when he did whatever he did to me.


Or I’m just stressing myself for no reason, maybe nothing happened or something happened but not with him. I’m confused, hurt, sad and angry.

2022-11-10 19:26:08,5,True,0,"TLDR: This is a long one. The situation is very complicated. I am not a very nice person but I am trying my best. I want to get back together with my older Ex but I need to know if this is real and true because I do not want to hurt her. I'm looking for both sides of the argument please and both subjective and objective advice. I want to be with her again (I think) but my #1 problem is I do not want to hurt her again. If possible, I would love to hear some stuff about you all if it is relevant so I can see how your life experiences can be related to mine.

Alright, so let's get some stuff out of the way. Yes, I understand we have a big age gap. And also I realize that I am a HUGE HUGE HUGE MASSIVE ASSHOLE BASTARD PERSON. For clarification though with my clickbait title, I did not physically cheat on her but I instead emotionally cheated on her which I consider to be equally if not more painful for her. 

  
So the older girl will be referred to as Allen. We dated for a relatively short amount of time maybe like 4 - 5 months. She was my manager for a place where I worked and I mistook her for her younger sister (whom I had met in the past). I think she is very gorgeous and super fucking smart. Hindsight 20/20 she was usually right about things. Especially when I started being distant. But just to confirm, we are definitely in two different places in our lives. Sex is important to me btw so I will be talking about it a fair amount. We had amazing sex. It was really really good. According to Allen, it was really good for both of us. I am definitely scared that I am using her for sex because I know what I have done in the past. Continuing on, we talked a lot and have a huge amount of common interests and outlooks on life. We just have a really natural relationship together, even now. I also feel like we both have similar trauma and can help each other a lot in a way that I think relationships build on each other. We went on a lot of fun adventures with was really cool for me as a younger guy. The usual problems exist when she is in a different place in life then I am. I'm starting my career and she doesn't really have one because it's not for her. She wants to be a writer and move to LA and stuff. Sometimes the stuff she says worries me but I am not sure if I'm afraid of intimacy or commitment or if I don't think the relationship can work.

So this other girl (Barry) is someone I had known for a long time. First of all, she saved my life. There was a point where I was going to &gt;!commit suicide!&lt; but long story short she helped me put my life back together. I went on literally two dates with Barry before I was dating Allen and we decided to just be friends. During my relationship with Allen, we started to go through rough patches. Part of this was work, some of it was age difference, some of it was the fact that my relationship with Allen had a deadline (she was going to move but not anymore), and some of it was that I wanted Barry. She was there for me emotionally during the hard times. I should have communicated with Allen about my feelings but I was foolish and still am. Btw, I also think she kind of manipulated me because I don't drink and one night she got me drunk and got close to me that night. It also feels like she went out of her way to get stuff out of me with my situation with Allen and Barry also confessed that she liked me very quickly after my breakup with Allen. I dated Barry for 3 months and then she went away for 3 months and came back and said that we are done. That kinda hurt but we are still on relatively good terms because I want to respect all people. I'm pretty sure she is lying to me about something but that's not my problem. Sex was terrible though. For both of us. Part of it was me for sure but she is kinda a dead weight in the bed. Head was good though. Also, I feel like she wasn't there for me in the relationship. She tells her friends that I was not there for her but I always made an effort to reach out and try to help and do things for her. It was always me going out of my way to do things for her. It kind of made me realize that what I had with Allen was good and that I took it for granted. I think she manipulated me because she was jealous of what I had and then after she took that she threw me away.

For the background regarding myself, I am a relatively successful college student with two majors in four years while also graduating with honors and more, no college debt, and a well playing job lined up when I leave. I want to stress the fact that I am doing well because I personally believe that my life is going really well and I have dreams and hobbies. I'm not super exciting, but also not boring. I'm kinda just your normal average Asian dude. I stress this because I believe that my life is going really well and that outside factors ARE NOT an issue with the situation. I will say that I have bipolar and schizophrenia which sometimes cloud my judgement which is why I'm asking for advice on how I feel. I think I forced myself to try to make my relationship with Barry work. I felt guilty for what I did to Allen and wanted to make sure that I didn't hurt her for no reason. 

So, why am I here? We are debating getting back together. We are both afraid of hurting each other. And I want to be here for the long run. I want to make sure that I can be here for her. I don't know how I feel and I'm here to try and analyze myself. I'm scared and I do not know what to do because I know what I am capable of. I think I love her in my mind but I have a lot of anxiety when I think about her. I'm not sure why I feel this way. Maybe its because I'm not ready? Maybe I don't actually love her and I'm using her? I feel like I want to be with her but whenever I think about the relationship I get scared. And I want to prioritize her first. Is it too soon? Am I doing this to make Barry jealous? There are so many bad endings that I'm not sure if it is worth it. But I still want her.

Is this a good idea or am I just living in the moment? Can I make this work for the long term? I don't really know what older people are looking for in relationships and I've read stuff about working and contributing to the household and stuff that I just don't have any knowledge about.

Shorty after my surgery it came to the surface that my dad has been using meth and other drugs which was insane, I still live at home too and we usually hang out at my house, I definitely think being in this environment dampers my mood, (we do plan on moving out next year tho ) there’s just so much going on emotionally I’m so numb and overwhelmed and I honestly don’t care to have sex. I feel bad because my boyfriends love language is physical touch and idk the way he acts about it honestly pisses me off. He’s not direct that it bothers him but I can sense how he speaks to me and his body language about it, like today we were kissing and he said he wanted to kiss without the intention of it leading to anywear else and I appreciated it. But then he just started doing too much and looked sad so I asked him what was wrong, he didn’t say anything and just stared at me. So again I’m like dude don’t do this bullshit, then he was like I can’t tell you I can’t talk about it and I’m like ???? Finally he just goes “I need to be patient that’s all” while slowly deep breathing. I pretended to not know what he was talking about and then went to make us food. But the way he acts like that makes me want to have sex even less than before. 

Idk emotionally my body has just been so hyper sensitive and doesnt feel safe. It’s lile my body rejects his body when it comes to kissing and sexual stuff. There’s nothing wrong with him tho I just wish it didnt bother him so much bc I am so tired and I just want to be held and cuddled",relationship_advice,I haven’t felt like having sex in a long time and it’s effecting my relationship,3.5,2022-11-10
2022-11-23 23:48:01,14,True,38,"What the title says. 

I will be omitting some details about my experience because I don't want this traced to me IRL. 

I am an ex sex worker. I have done survival sex work in desperate times in my life, and later turned to online sex work because its what I was used to. I did cam modeling, porn, and then of course, OnlyFans. I got decently successful with OnlyFans but decided to close my account because I just didn't want to do it anymore. 

I see people joking about starting an OnlyFans, ""I need a few extra bucks, might as well!"" Or, more misleadingly, hear people boast online about ""I make $50k a month just flashing my panties!"" That is not the full story, and it's probably not even true to begin with. 

OnlyFans is like any other media platform. You need fans, you need viewers, and unlike places like TikTok and YouTube, OnlyFans does not have an algorithm or anything, or a home page in the same way most other media platforms do. You need to promote your link elsewhere and get people to click the link and subscribe to your profile. OnlyFans won't do any advertising for you. And like being any other kind of influencer, it takes time and effort to build a following.

Effort. Yes I said effort. It's actually not easy to make a ton of money on OnlyFans, especially at first. People talk about it like you just take a few naked pictures and post them and then money goes to your bank account. If you want to make big bucks with OnlyFans, you're going to need high quality lighting, high quality picture resolution, nice lingerie and/or accessories, a large enough space to take pics/videos, and you're going to need a lot of time. Time to do your makeup, set up backgrounds, set up lighting and camera, then edit your content, schedule it, promote it, and what nobody seems to know about OnlyFans, is the most successful people also usually interact with their fans. Fans will pay for chats, pay for private video calls, and pay for custom content. So you're also likely going to be offered some money to make a film you simply... don't want to make. But people do anyway because the people who buy custom content usually have a lot of money, and pay a lot. They will usually send you the props and accessories and clothes in the mail--so now you need a PO box. 

A lot of people do OnlyFans on the side and make some extra money, and that will require less time, but still, for it to be worth the money you put into it, you need to get the fans in the first place. They don't just come out of nowhere. And for the larger creators, it is their full time job, and it takes up most of their time. Its not ""easy money"", and it's definitely not ""quick money"". 

I could also talk about the current over saturation of new workers on OnlyFans right now, which is making it even harder to become successful on it. And I could also talk about how OnlyFans is not a company that is kind to the people that sell on their site. But that's not what this post is about. 

Make an OnlyFans or not I don't care. But do your research first, because it's not what everyone on the Internet claims it to be.",TrueOffMyChest,"News flash: starting an OnlyFans isn't fast, easy money.",26.0,2022-11-23

He's aware that I'm interested in women and seems to be alright with it. However, I had posted a comment to a post on an Interest called single lesbians.

If you say you don't know what I'm talking about, its to do with the boob slapping comment."" I think he is embarrassed because his 'relatives' who I'm also friends with on there are aunts and uncles and cousins and whatever. And now I'm worried that side of the family who didn't realize I was gay is asking him all sorts of stuff now and making him uncomfortable.

A few weeks ago I found he had been on a Reddit account messaging people sexually almost every single day starting at the end of August. Several years ago, I had caught him explicitly video chatting with women online but forgiven him. This worse. There hundreds of conversations. Almost every one revolved around fantasizing about cheating on me. The worst part was that there were 23 separate conversations (spread between the first day of the account and the day that I caught him) that revolved around him being sexually attracted to my sister. He described her looks well so I know exactly which one he was talking about. He created elaborate sexual fantasies about fooling around with her. He said he finds her so much hotter than me and has to fight a boner when she wears a swim suit. He talked about ejaculating into her underwear. He claimed multiple times that he once saw her naked by accident years ago when she lived with us for a summer.

Needless to say, I left with our son as soon as I saw it. I have been living with my mother. He claims all of it was fantasy and not real. That what he really was getting off on was the reactions of the people he was talking to. That he wanted to turn people on with how taboo it was. I just feel like if that was the case, then there would have been more variety. He talked a lot more often with women about how he wanted to cheat on me with them, sleep with them in our bed, use my toys on them, etc. But when it came to the conversations about other fantasies, there were only maybe a handful other taboo things mentioned. And not nearly in as much detail. 

My pregnancy was high risk so I couldn’t have sex the majority of it. I had a c section to recover from and then we were very busy with our son. He had sex with me once since he was born. I would have been willing any time, I just didn’t think to initiate it. I feel he definitely chose to masturbate to her rather than have sex with me.

He says he is going to therapy and is begging me to come home with our son. Deep in my heart, I want to. I miss our family so bad. I want to give my son the chance to have both his parents together. And I love my husband.

But on the other hand, how can I ever trust him? Especially around my sister. How can I be intimate with him knowing he preferred to think of her? I have told my best friend and my mom that he said in the messages that he was attracted to her. They say they will support me no matter what I choose to do, but how can I really look them in the eye knowing they know? And if he does talk to people sexually online again, or worse, cheats on me physically, then it will be my fault that my son will have to go through our family breaking up when he is older. 

Would I be making a huge mistake to give him another chance? Has any one handled a similar situation? Is this something that is forgivable in any way?

Let me rewind and explain why this is so important to me and goes beyond just sex. If it was just sex, I would be ok with her saying no, plain and simple. 

But the fact is, the first time I saw Avatar in theaters years ago, I cried and was moved because I felt connected to my Native American heritage for the first time in my life. Some puzzle pieces in my head finally clicked together of what it all really means.

My family had always talked about how my great great grandmother was a Cherokee princess. Like she wasn’t just an ordinary cherokee, she was royalty. I take it seriously. I’ve always wanted to learn more about my culture. I know that avatar is fiction and that it’s not the same- but ive really tried to do my homework and be involved in cherokee culture since then. I have a badass dream catcher collection and also I think I am wolf clan. But I think Avatar will always be my gateway to Native Pride!

Long story short, my love for Avatar over the years grew in other ways. Every time I jerked off and thought where I want to be and who I want to jerk off to, why would I want to be anywhere but in Pandora locking braids with a beautiful blue woman? I will spare the other details….What can I say-reality bites. 

Thankfully post-nut clarity affords me the ability to deal with reality and move on and keep a job and a gf, of course….. but over time, I couldn’t get it out of my head. I finally told her what I wanted and she refused. I told her, it’s just roleplay. She won’t budge.

I don’t understand what the big deal is. I think given how important the franchise is to me on a deep spiritual level, she ought to at least try for the sake of my well being. 

I will add, the best sex I ever had was with someone in a stitch (from lilo and stitch) costume after a Halloween party- obviously I pretended the costume was Avatar the best I could. I was just so lucky to find a situation where blue body paint was involved. I think back to it all the time.

I’ll try to sum this up and best as I can. My girlfriend and I were going through some rough stuff and she ended up moving out. I begged her not to but she still left. We started talking again about a week after she left and we reconnected and recommitted to each other. She was at her sisters in another state during this time and they had a trip planned to Miami. I talked to her every day for a week leading up to this trip. 

The trip comes. She’s there Thursday - Monday. We text the whole time, talk on the phone for 10 minutes Saturday and an hour and a half Sunday. She comes home Monday and tells me she has Covid. I immediately got suspicious, like I just had this gut feeling. So I did a little snooping. 

Come to find out she made out with some random guy she met Saturday. She tells me “we only kissed for a couple minutes” I later find out she sat on his last and made out for almost an hour. I was pretty devastated but I was working through it. 

6 weeks go by. I then later find out she slept with someone Friday night, and made out with another guy Sunday night. I confront her about it and she tells me she was assaulted. I’m very confused at this point. It seems like it wasn’t assault until I found out. She claims she got so drunk she blacked over the course of 5 or so hours drinking only about 4 shots and 2 mixed drinks. I’ve drank with this girl a lot. She never gets blackout drunk even when we drink more.  

She gets very unbalanced, sleepy, slurs words, and is all over the place when she’s regular drunk, let alone blackout drunk. Her sister is a lawyer (also hardcore feminist) and was there the whole time. Never once did her sister hint it being assault, or that she was not consenting. 

This shit is haunting me.    

I would hate to think she’s lying but she has lied about everything to do with that weekend. I’m in therapy but it’s not helping me deal with this. I wonder if I should just break things off after 5 years of being so happy with her. I still feel like she’s lying to me about what happened that night and over the course of that weekend.

It’s 9:00 at night, and the store is mostly empty and fairly quiet. The kind old greeter man greets me as I walk in. I get the ring and a candy bar and go use the self-checkout to rid myself and any poor kid at a register from potential awkwardness. 

Then, I begin to walk out when the security barrier alarm goes off. Shit. The old man comes over to double-check my bag and I happily hand him the receipt and my bag. He looks in it and looks back at me. ‘Hmmmmmmm…’, he says and smiles as if this is an enjoyable experience. I guess it is to him, because he proceeds to take it out in front of the 15 people at the checkout watching me, and walk it back over to the security barrier plain as day to check and see if it truly is my newly purchased cock ring making the alarm go off, and not the candy bar. 

Of course it is, and it beeps again, bringing anyone else’s attention over to my predicament. 

‘You’re all set.’ He says with another grin. He knows he just completely destroyed my libido and he’s grinning. Last time I ever get anything sexual from anywhere but the internet. 


Tl;dr went to the supermarket to get a cock ring, and left the supermarket with a cock ring and a limp dick.

I've (25F) been growing increasingly worried that my brother (middle sibling, 28M) is going to do something drastic to hurt my parents (in their 60s). His behavior has been growing more and more erratic and full of rage stemming from his own mistakes that he continually blames my parents for. I'm afraid he is slowly losing touch with reality as well, I am essentially estranged from him apart from being facebook friends with him and running into him when I visit my parents (and \~85% of the time, he causes a big scene ending up with my intervention and him screaming and yelling as he leaves the house). His facebook posts have been a strange stream of consciousness type of thing and he mentions my parents in a couple of them in a kind of scary light. His most recent one regarding them essentially says ""fortunately, they are old and will die soon."" He's made threats to my mom and my dad and even though he has gone to therapy (paid for by parents), his therapist has taken the route of also blaming my parents for all of his emotional scars and mistakes. Although I'm sure the therapist did this out of good intention to validate his feelings and hopefully get him to heal and move on, my brother has increasingly been refusing to take responsibility for his own actions in the past and the present and is incredibly emotionally unstable. I know he also owns a gun, so that just makes me extra concerned. He has not done anything physically harmful to them during these most recent incidents as far as I know and has only had one time maybe 7 years or so ago where he did get physical. He also has some mild(?) substance use issues (no hard drugs as far as I know though).

I've told my parents I believe he needs to go to a psychiatrist and get some diagnoses since his behavior isn't something a neurotypical person would do and has been worsening ever since he was in his late teens/early 20s. I gave them a recommendation for a psychiatrist I think would work best with my brother, but haven't heard whether there has been any progress with that.

I've been sitting with this feeling that he's going to harm my parents for about over a year now, with a few incidents passing where I got close to calling the police on him but was afraid that I would escalate a situation that my parents could de-escalate on their own. But it's getting clearer to me that even they are not able to reign in his anger and that they don't know what to do. I don't know what I should do or if I should do anything at all, but I figured I would seek out some advice from anyone else who may have been in a similar situation. 

Are there any steps I can take to better protect my parents just in case something does happen? Is there such a thing as being able to request police to patrol around our house frequently or hire some sort of service to protect them discreetly? I will be asking my own therapist about what steps could be taken, but until our appointment, I wanted to hear what other people have to say.

I still hold love for my brother in my heart despite how much I do also have great anger towards him because I know right now he is not the brother I grew up with. Ideally, I want a solution that doesn't completely ruin his life and hopefully instead snaps him back into reality with the skills to emotionally regulate and enjoy life again with our family all together. Thanks so much in advance for the advice.

TDLR: my brother is undiagnosed, but clearly neurodivergent with some mood/personality disorder and has been increasingly antagonistic towards my parents, who he blames for every mistake and for him being the person he is today.

M invited my boyfriend and I to hang out with he and his wife one weekend and we accepted. While there, I told them about what I do as a side hustle; I dabble in adult entertainment on a popular website. I did not specify my stage name nor the name of the website to them for privacy. Not long after talking about it, we moved on to other conversation, we had a nice rest of the evening. 

Fast forward to a month ago, I've pretty much long forgotten about that conversation and M got promoted to regional manager, so I seldom see him. I come in for my shift and my newest manager says she needs to talk with me. I'm thinking I'm in trouble, but she sits me down in her office and the conversation goes as follows: 

""So, try not to be upset.""

""About what?""

""I know you do adult film.""

I'm panicking at this point, thinking I'm going to be fired. ""Oh. How did you find out?"" 

""M's wife found you, showed him, and he showed me."" 

""Am I going to be fired?""

""No, I'm not even mad at you, but I want you to know that she found you, and she's a blabbermouth.""

I told him no, when M asked why because he knows my days off, I told him that his wife makes me uncomfortable and I'm still very upset with her that she violated my privacy by looking for me across numerous websites, found me, and told people without my permission. M told me I was overreacting and that I just shouldn't have put myself out on the internet in the first place. Afraid of potentially being reprimanded, I just stopped answering. 

I talked to a couple of people about it, they say I'm not in the wrong, but I need more than two people's opinions.

The typical routine is to take off my pants, lay down on my bed, pull my underwear down to my ankles, take my right leg out of the underwear so I can spread my legs which in turn spreads my cheeks, and proceed to apply the cream. Usually what I do after this is to pull up my underwear while still in my bed using my clean hand, and get up and walk to the bathroom to clean my hands and cream applier.

Today, however, my very stupid self decided it would be a good idea to stand up and try to pull my underwear up using one hand. It was working at first but since my right leg wasn’t in the right side of the underwear, I tried to lift my leg to put it in there. This resulted in me starting to lose my balance, and eventually I fell on my front side. Keep in my mind I didn’t actually get the underwear on yet so I fell on my penis and legs. 

The fall made a loud thumping sound which my parents in the next room 100% heard. Before they even said anything or started walking to my room, I loudly said “I’m Ok , please don’t come in” while pulling my under wear up after struggling to get up. 

I awkwardly walked to the bathroom and cleaned my hands, while my dad asked me what happened. When I told him he burst out laughing. I was laughing too but it was still pretty embarrassing.

Quick backstory : I met the girl in 2018 during my freshman year of college. We practically lived together, we were ALWAYS together. I did consider her to be one of my closest friends. What made it better was that we were from the same state, only lived about 1.5hrs away from each other so occasionally i’d drive down to see her.

We always agreed on getting a place together and things like that &amp; the time finally came in 2020. It was supposed to start off as just us two but she asked if i was okay if someone else she knew moving in with us as well. I didn’t have a problem with it.

I knew the person because they were bestfriends and would FT often so i’d see him and we’d talk sometimes lol, but i never really KNEW him. Come to find out , they started dating and I never even knew it.

Oct. 2020, we move in and everything is great, we finally got our own place, can smoke in our own apartment without hearing complaints, pretty much FREEDOM. 
 
I usually kept to myself bc i never was a big fan on third wheeling, still kind of not a fan of it but to each’s own. I would hang with them sometimes, but at other times i’d be by myself because as my friend why do i always have to spend time with you AND your boyfriend and we already live together yk ..

FF .. turns out their abusive towards each other. they would get into screaming matches with each other at all times of the night, i’ve physically seen him hit her on multiple occasions, she’s hit him too. We’ve had our neighbors call the police on us and everything.

We did have good times, we used to do tabs together and still have smoke sessions but i used to tell them also that they were making the environment uncomfortable for me and they said they understood and would do better.

At one point in time while we were doing tabs i felt like he would say certain things as a form of manipulation while we were that high for things to be subliminally planted in our heads but that’s neither here nor there.

It’s a lot more build up but, here we are April 2021 and i’ve reached my breaking point. I decided to go back home to my mom’s house and stay for a while, granted i knew he was still being abusive towards her but i felt like i exhausted all i could trying to get her to leave and go to her mom’s house.

We would be on 3 way and he would be threatening to shoot her and all kinds of crazy things. I eventually decided not to go back there and she made me feel like I was never a real friend to her because i decided not to come back and she said i left her to deal with that by herself.

But i felt like i really did try to do everything i could for her, but after a while it was really taking a toll on my mental health, so i chose myself over them.

My boyfriend and I have been together almost 2 years (I’ll be 21 in 3 months for anyone concerned about legality) and today he informed me that there was “no point” in us being in a relationship since I don’t want to have children. We’ve had many ups and downs in our relationship and although I can’t really imagine my life without him, this statement really hurt me. I am a survivor of child sexual abuse starting around age 5 and going until I was about 13. I am also someone who had dealt with sex addiction pretty much since my abuse started and this behavior peaked when I was about 13 up until a few months into my boyfriend and I’s relationship. I have been raped and have experienced a lot of emotional and some physical abuse. I have been diagnosed with PTSD, BPD, and Major Depressive Disorder but have since had my diagnosis reduced to PTSD, BPD, and MINOR depressive order after years of therapy and psychiatric assistance. I feel a lot better and am able to function significantly “better” than 6 years ago. However, I still struggle with sexual experiences and dealing with doctors due to other trauma along with traumas already mentioned. Even though I’ve expressed that children are not something I see in my future because of this trauma and personal reasons, my boyfriend today informed me that our relationship was “pointless” because I didn’t want to have his child (please keep in mind this was in a gas station parking lot). He already has 3 children and a 4th he claims as his own as the mother is his ex-wife, with 4 different women being the mothers to these children. I have no issue with this, I am a very open person due to my own experiences and have no issues with his kids or what he did to get them, but was very hurt when I was told that my lack of desire of children made our relationship a waste of time. I am not at all comfortable with bringing another child into this world not only because of my trauma but also because of the cost, the state of the world, and other personal reasons. Hearing him say this to me though
 I’ve told him several times that children were not a desire was hard, and I’m considering ending this relationship because of it. I am currently on birth control to help with my what my doctor suspects is endometriosis. I cannot afford the surgery to confirm this diagnosis at this moment because of another surgery I need but I plan on having the procedure as soon as possible to rule out or help treat my endometriosis. With this diagnosis comes painful sex and periods, low mood and libido, and sometimes infertility. Knowing that there is a chance I will never be able to physically conceive makes me wonder how my boyfriend will react if I find out I am unable to produce children. I have expressed openness to adoption if we are able to afford it but this doesn’t seem like a good enough answer for him.

2022-03-25 04:26:50,0,True,0,"TL;DR My girlfriend and I had a great relationship, but after one fight, things felt different and have started to become very uncomfortable. I have tried to fix things, but don't know how.

Me(18f) and my girlfriend (19f) met last summer on an international trip and became super close friends instantly. We fell in love and became official on a camping trip before we went to school. We live in different states, and go to college far from each other, so we knew long distance was going to suck, but decided we wanted to try. Everything went fantastic for our first semester, we were constantly excited to talk to each other and would wake up early or stay up late just to talk. Every few months one of us would fly in and stay with each other for a weekend.

Things are different now, long distance is really tough as our love language is physical touch. We have grown apart, and began to fight more. I thought I was asexual for a long time, and told her this before we began dating. She told me that she was as well, but after a few months of dating we progressed from long make out sessions to having sex. It has been great, but when she first told me she wasn't asexual, it freaked me out, as I have had some bad experiences in past relationships. Basically, I got scared and started crying, and we ended up talking all night long about it. Eventually I realized I was fine with being sexual with her, and that I actually really wanted it. Ever since then, things have been kind of different. I know I shouldn't have had that reaction when she told me, I just got really scared. But, we moved on and I thought our relationship would be stronger. Things feel different now though. I'm always afraid of hurting her feelings, and I feel like I have to be super careful about every little thing I say. We have always talked about getting married, and I mentioned having a kid. We were making up scenarios of having fun with our little girl, and I made a joke about sneaking some dessert to our daughter if she got in trouble. When talking about how we want to raise her, I accepted all of the things she wanted to do (she is very close with her family, and I want to respect that). I told her that I think it's important to spend individual time with our kid as well. My girlfriend got really hurt about this, and told me I was making her into a villain, and that I was only describing scenarios without her in them. She has continuously brought this and things like this up, even though I always apologize and make sure to correct what hurts her feelings.

I dunno... I feel like everything has become subtly passive aggressive, and she keeps mentioning everything 'not being how it used to be.' I have asked her how I can be better and fix things, but she won't tell me. She even mentioned watching an old video of us, and she said she misses the way 'I used to look at her,' and wouldn't elaborate. I love her more than anything, and I have tried so hard to be better for her, but I feel like nothing I do fixes anything. 

Things are fantastic when we're in-person, but not so much over the phone.

She is travelling right now, and didn't have cell service for four days. We are usually on facetime every chance we get, so it has been tough without her. When she called me once she got service, she said that the last few days have been a good thing because she hasn't had to worry. I did not really understand, but she was on a bus and did not want to explain. It left a pit in my stomach.

I love her, and want to be her wife one day, but I am worried things may not work out if they continue this way.

Little backstory:

I used to have a roommate when i was in my early 20's. We were really good friends and got a long super well. Back in University i was in a little 'phase' and had lots of variety in my sex life (lol).

For a while I dated a guy and stufff happened and we all three ended up in a threesome together and I had my first bisexual experiences with her. Later we also tried again just on our own. It was fun and I don't regret it at all.

It was all casual and I didn't think much of it honestlyyyy. Sooo when I moved out and got my first Job we still met for coffee but it fizzled out and I thought thats just how it goes with roommates from University.

Few years ago when she realized I am going to move to Europe for a job her requests became more frequent and she messaged me all the time and asked me for advice for her relationship and it became a little bit too much for me so I tried to distance myself from it but it made it even worse. She tried to figure out where I am going to work, who I am going to work with and where I am going to live.

When I got started in Europe she tried to keep an eye on who I am dating and what I am doing all the time and I never really felt like telling her but she ALWAYS forced the issue and silly me always told her. She tried to interject herself in my private life across the atlantic haha. It was wild. In the beginning I thought shes just trying to be a good friend and I didn't have anybody and she made me felt bad for it and said I am using her.

She asked me when she can come to Europe all the time to visit and I postponed it a lot but eventually I gave in. Last year we spent some time together and it was alright. She was relatively normal.

My partner tells me all the time to cut her off and to tell her that I don't want to talk to her anymore and that I don't want her in my life but I always give in eventually cause I feel bad. It became an issue in my relationship too (she even tries to message him sometimes and asks him what I am up to).

Noowww you'd think moving to a different continent would solve the issue but she just messaged me and told me that she booked a flight and that I have to pick her up at the airport on Friday and i dont't want to.

She knows where I live and I am overwhelmed. 

How do I get out of this?

2022-04-19 21:51:25,25,True,0,"My partner smokes cigarettes occasionally and I hate it. When we first met 8 months ago I expressed my opinion and she told me she was 100% planning to quit because she doesn't want to do it anymore. I obviously believed her and she surprisingly quit for 6 months but has started doing it again occasionally. 

My mother was a prolific smoker for years and it terrified me as a child and she literally quit for my benefit but I always feared I would find out she had started again and it's never really left me so I think it's sort of deep inside me. 

Leading on from my mother, my biggest fear was finding out my partner would do it behind my back, which low and behold she has done. 

I love her so much and I know it's not going to kill her to do it occasionally and even though it hurts to know she's doing it, I really want to change my mindset and accept it. 

I've tried to persuade her to stop but it's just going to make her do it more so I want to just accept her, for herself. 

I want someone to tell me how to change my mindset so it doesn't hurt my insides knowing she's smoking? I just want her to be happy.

2022-06-03 23:06:49,15,True,2,"My bf (27m) and I (23f) have been dating for 6 months and we've only had sex about 9 times in that whole time. At first I thought he just wasn't a very sexual person but about a month and a half ago I saw him with a game open and he had downloaded mods to make his female character pretty much naked. When I got closer he saw me and clicked to a different page quickly. I was asked what it was and he said it was none of my business in a mean tone. 

A few days latter same scenario but this time he was taking a screenshot of a online female character that was not his with different mods from before. I asked what he was doing and he exited screenshot mode without saving it said he was doing it to send in the discord for the game and asked if I had a problem with that. I said ya kinda a little and that it made me uncomfortable. He said it shouldn't and then turned around and went back to playing the game without taking the screenshot.

Neither of these characters looked like me so its been causing a lot of insecurities. Especially because we had gone about two months without sex.

Another time I was walking to the bathroom and looked in the bedroom and he was playing an actual dating/sex sim like hunypop. I don't know what the name of the game was but in it his character was sexting a woman. I couldn't read the messages but I've played games like that in the past so I recognized the layout. He kept switching between screens so it was never on the screen for more the a few seconds so he was clearly trying to hide it.

After I was done in the bathroom I told him I had seen it and he tried to act like he didn't know what I was talking about but I kept pushing. I told him that all these things were making me uncomfortable and insecure and he said he didn't know what he was supposed to do about it. I told him that we needed to talk about it because it was effecting our relationship negatively. I sat on the bed and told him how it was making me feel that he was doing and hiding all these things. He said he feels like it is private and shamful thing and that he doesn't have to talk to me about it.

I tried telling him that its pretty normal and that I've even played games like that before and that I wouldn't have an issue with it if he wasn't being suspicious and hiding it. Suspicious behavior leads to trust issues. We could even play a game like that together cause it could be fun. He kept saying that he didn't know what to say or what to do about it. I told him that his lack of physical affection for me was causing me mental and emotional damage and that we needed to figure something out. He said OK and things were better for about two weeks. We had sex a few times and I hadn't seen him play any of those games again.

We had shared phone passwords and computer passwords in the beginning of our relationship. After that last incident he changed both passwords which caused an issue with the computer as I need to input his password to update or download anything on my profile on his computer. Other then that I never used either password for phone or computer because I trusted him. I asked him about it and he said he didnt feel like he had enough privacy and that it was like a panick response to change all of his passwords. It just made me feel like he was hiding more then I've seen.

I have the profile on his computer to play games that are to much for my laptop or to use websites to watch movies and connect it to the living room tv. I got on the computer and he had left his profile logged in to charge his wireless headset. He had a lot of things pulled up and it was overwhelming so I started minimizing them so I could think. I got to a third google tab(? Not a tab but when you click google to many times and it opens multiple different tabs) and it had recent downloads still at the bottom of the screen and it was more sex mods for the first game. Things like nipple clamps and other stuff.

My mood immediately dropped. After a few seconds I continued minimizing things so there wasn't information overload. I switched to my profile and watched the show I was wanting to watch but could hardly enjoy it since there were other things on my mind. I haven't told him that I saw those downloads yet as its only been a day or two since I saw them but we're supposed to be having a talk tonight. I have a feeling of how its going to end, with him saying he doesn't know what to do or say. With nothing solved or compromised.

I really like him and want to work to fix it, but he's not giving me a lot to work with. He says he wants to be with me as well, that our relationship is just a new type of relationship to him and he doesn't know how to be in it. That he has walls up and he doesn't know how to get passed them.

We're supposed to be having a talk about it tonight. I don't really know what else to do other then try and offer suggestions as to how we fix our problems, but every time I do he shoots them down, and thats why I'm here asking for advice from the people of reddit.

2022-06-03 23:19:46,5,True,12,"Throwaway bc reasons, on mobile so sorry for formatting.

This was maybe two months ago. My wife and I were housesitting for her brother and his wife while they were out of town a few days. He told us to help ourselves to everything in the house, the usual. I'm a sucker for pretzels and there were a lot of pretzel bags in the pantry, but they tasted stale as hell. On closer inspection, the best by date was Halloween of two years ago. No big deal, so I move on to a different bag: cheddar jalapeño cheetos, my favorite flavor.

Much like the pretzels, these tasted stale as shit, but it's my favorite so by God I'm gonna finish the whole thing and I do. This is sometime in the early afternoon, between noon and 2pm. Around I think 4pm, I start kind of looking for dinner ideas, and I whip up some instant mashed potatoes (wife and I are sluts for potatoes of all types) and I'm thinking ""damn is EVERYTHING in the pantry expired?"" because my mouth is beyond dry and nothing is saving these mashed potatoes for me, so my wife asks if I want Burger King down the road and I agree.

As she pulls up the menu, I struggle to read what's in front of me. Everything is getting kind of dark, but I assume it's the lighting or something like that. I ask her to drive because I hate driving and she loves driving, and it's as we're pulling onto the main road, when my eyes are watering and I'm struggling to keep them open, that it hits me like one of those cartoon flashbacks: why do I feel HIGH?

I've done edibles a handful of times before, so I knew what being high felt like, but why did I feel high now? The cheetos. I turn to my wife and ask ""hey does your brother ever do edibles?"" ""Yeah why?"" And then it clicks for her and she takes a good look at me and says ""oh baby no.""

Immediately after realizing what's happened, I start having a panic attack because the full effects start hitting at that moment. Yall know what I mean. I'm manually breathing at this point. I remember she asks what I want to eat. I have no idea what I responded with, and then there's a memory gap until I'm sitting at the kitchen table saying off the wall shit. I called one of the dogs the chupacabra. Muttering something about the hat man even though I didn't do DMT. Genuinely have no clue of what happens between the Burger King parking lot and waking up the next morning, except for one moment: my wife looking at the empty bag of cheetos and saying ""this had 600mg of THC, did you eat the whole thing?"" I did, in fact, eat the whole thing.

Anyway, I wake up the next morning STILL fucking high, but much more tolerable. Everything is still swaying a little but I can function as a person now. The mashed potatoes from the day before were not expired, I just had cotton mouth from those damn cheetos. Wife is laughing her ass off while I am BEGGING her not to tell her brother (she did not but I think he suspects it was me). I don't fully feel okay again until I wake up the *next* day. 0/10 worst trip ever, did more to swear me off of drugs than the DARE program could've hoped.

2022-06-03 21:04:00,4,True,1,"I was diagnosed with anhedonia, the inability to feel pleasure, some time ago. I wasn't surprised at all; I fit all the symptoms and it explained so much. But in talking with other people (therapist, friends, etc) it seems to me that there is an entire sensation and subset of emotions I cannot experience, and I'm trying to reconcile this with my experiences.

I've had sex. It was completely unaffecting. The first time it was a neat novelty but thereafter each time was entirely for the other person or me trying to figure out what I'm missing. I can experience some arousal, and I can relieve it through sex/masturbation, but there's no actual sensation of pleasure. The closest thing I could compare it to is sneezing: when the sneeze is building up, you want to get it out, and winding up for a sneeze only to not be able to is frustrating. And an actual sneeze can be satisfying. But I wouldn't ever call it ""pleasure"", merely relieving a discomfort that had built up, like the relief after needing to urinate, defecate, yawn, stretch, etc.

Similarly, do people actually feel an emotion of enjoyment or fun? There are things I quite like—TV shows, video games, books, theatre, my friends, etc—but I term those things as ""enjoyable"" because I'm not bored while I engage with them and it occupies my attention and keeps my interest. But there's no actual emotion that comes along with them; I don't feel an emotion like I do when, say,  a friend hurts me (sadness) or I'm in danger (fear). Those are actual, distinct sensations/emotions, and there's no positive one I have. I can look forward to things, even anticipate them eagerly, but I don't feel any ""excitement"". I can participate in activities that are stimulating and interesting, but there's no attendant emotion of ""fun"". I get as much ""joy"" out of those sorts of things as I get pain out of a limb that's fallen asleep; the pins and needles are distinctly unpleasant but I don't think I could really call it ""pain"".

I feel like a colourblind person trying to understand the concept of red, and it's hard to accept that other people might perceive this thing I'm incapable of. I suppose I'm just looking for a large response group here. **TL;DR: are those sorts of things (pleasure, fun, excitement) actual emotions/sensations or are they just shorthand/a hyperbolic description?**",NoStupidQuestions,Is pleasure a physical sensation people experience?

2022-07-22 03:53:21,3,True,1,"Hi there. So a few things off the bat, I know you all can't give advice on mental health/medical health issues so while my problem relates to that in no way am I seeking medical or mental advice but rather a better way to communicate to my husband. I'm using a throwaway because frankly this situation is weird to describe and I don't want it attached to my main. I'm gonna put a TW for bodily harm but this is not related to abuse in any way. Just, if you're squimish like me ya might not love this. 

I 24F have been married to my husband 28F for just over a month now but have been together for many years and we have a 2 year old together. Needless to say this isn't a new relationship by any standard.

I originally found out about this issue a few years ago when we were still in the beginning months of dating. I thought it was insane and begged him to stop but he brushed me off like it was no big deal. Something important to know is at the time I didn't believe in therapy as I'd had some awful experiences. However at the time I was seriously struggling with my mental health and my husband was the one to push for me to get help. I was unwilling at first but to make him happy I agreed to give it a shot, so I went and tried again miraculously finding an amazing fit that time (4th times the charm?) and after years of regular therapy we both have noticed a drastic improvement to my mental health. I'm so thankful I had the opportunity. Unfortunately I now have his insurance which my old therapist doesn't accept so I have to find a new one but this is just to say I used to think it didn't work and HE pushed me to go. So he acknowledged the benefit of therapy when it comes to ME which is important for now.

Anyways at the time I wasn't in therapy, didn't believe in the benefits so while I did beg him to stop I didn't push for any type of professional help.

After therapy helped me I noticed he still did the thing that worried me so I asked if he would be willing to see someone himself about the issue. He again brushed it off like it was no big deal. I begged him to take it seriously and try to stop which for a few months I think he did. I didn't check him regularly though and you'll understand why in a second. Sorry to be purposefully vague but I feel like if I just say it outright no one will read this because it sounds so ludicrous.

Fast forward to a couple months ago. Just before the wedding I caught him doing the thing. I asked him why he was doing it. He nonchalantly said he just does it he's not thinking about it. I told him he really needed to stop. It wasn't normal or healthy. I was worried about him. He brushed it off and, I admit, I let it go to the back of my mind in the craze of last minute wedding prep. I should've stayed on top of it more but then, I also don't know what more I could've really done.

That's most of the context so now for clarity sake.. he's pulling off his toe nails habitually. As in, as soon as they grow back he yanks them off. I'm shocked they still grow back frankly; I guess I assumed at some point they'd stop? But so far so ""good"". His pinky toes are two bloody little stumps. To his credit his big toes, index(?) toes, and middle toes are never hurt. Just his ring(?) toes and MAINLY his pinky toes (those ones were and currently are the most common. Question marks are because I just realized I've never called toes by name like I do fingers. So.. yeah). He claims that outside of the couple months I was watching for it he has been doing it consistently.

So now it's tonight. Once again I noticed it. I asked him seriously why he thinks it's okay. What is going through his head? He claims he just does it when he's thinking and can't help it. I told him I'm worried for him, this isn't normal. Not to be mean, just legitimately it's not. Like.. if this were his finger nails EVERYONE would tell him it's not normal and he needs help; but because it's his toes he can keep it well hidden. But that doesn't make it less concerning!

He pointed out that I hadn't really noticed but in my point of view a) he usually wears socks and showers in the morning as opposed to my night showers so I rarely see his bare feet; even if I have the opportunity I don't make a general point about looking down at his toes!  and b) that doesn't make it less concerning of a problem!

I asked again for him to please seek therapy. Even just to let a professional know he's doing this so he MIGHT have help. I know it's not gonna be an overnight difference but asking nicely for him to stop and try seriously not to hasn't done anything so NOT talking to a professional certainly isn't gonna make the difference! But he brushed me off again saying it's a waste of time and money. I pointed out that when it comes to MY therapy it was so important he hounded me for months to just try it; not saying I wasn't bad but ""all I did"" was cry more easily and get frightened by mundane things (irrelevant backstory as to why). He's legitimately mutilating himself. Crying a lot and pulling off nails from nailbeds are two TOTALLY different levels of concern. Like yes take both seriously but.. ones obviously a bit more extreme off the bat no?? He doesn't seem to understand and I feel like I'm talking in circles.

If this were just like.. biting his nails or I don't know a normal not bloody nervous tick I wouldn't be nearly as worried but his toes are literally bloody little stumps right now. Where toe nails should be is just a dark scab. It's horrifying to look at. There's a reason pulling nails off show up in horror movies, shit is *effective* only he's not even phased by it!!  Im worried it's only a matter of time before they're infected. Like sure so far apparently no issue but that doesn't mean it WONT happen! They're literally consistently opened wounds.. not to mention the obvious nerve damage since he says it doesn't hurt ""anymore"". DUDE. Not to mention, again this isn't a normal tick. He's hurting himself even if it doesn't hurt directly. You're still bleeding that counts for something!

Again in no way am I asking for mental or medical advice for him or I. That's for a medical professional to handle and I'm happy (and wanting desperately!) To leave it to them! But for those who have had a friend or loved one need help and refuse to even consider they do.. what can I do to better express my concern to him? I feel like I'm borderline nagging him at this point because he's just so nonchalant about the issue.. I feel crazy almost like I'm supposed to treat this as normal too! I don't want to fight him, or monitor his freaking toes like he's a child; but I think he genuinely needs help and he won't even have a genuine discussion about my concern just ""it's not a big deal honey, it's a waste of time/money"" (our insurance has a copay but not one we couldn't easily afford 1-2 times a month for EACH of us! So it's not a money issue).

I just want to be able to discuss this with him in a better, more supportive way? I guess? Rather than what feels confrontational but I don't know any good way to phrase my concerns and would love help from those whove been in similar positions to communicate their worries to their loved ones. I've googled this kind of thing and it does seem to fit with a genuine compulsion/anxiety issue (again not a professional but until he sees one it's all I can do) so it definitely seems like there are options to consider if he would just acknowledge the weirdness of this situation but I can't even get him to that. It's just him ""picking"" as he calls it. I feel like I'm at a dead end here and I'm just baffled. I don't see why he won't even CONSIDER therapy for himself after how hard he pushed me to pursue it for my own issues! Any advice on how to approach this conversation is appreciated. I plan to talk to my own therapist about this as well once I'm able to resume appointments. Thanks in advance

2022-08-18 22:34:10,1,True,11,"This happened about three weeks ago. I was on holiday abroad and crossing the road and there were some poles by the pedestrian crossing probably slightly over a metre high. I was feeling a little hyper and decided in my infinite wisdom to try leapfrogging it (just don't ask why). I fell and fractured my leg (both tibia and fibia). It was pretty quiet had to wait ten minutes for a passerby to ask them to call an ambulance (my phone was destroyed in the fall too) and tried to avoid looking down at my foot the whole time which was just pointing in a completely unnatural way (think Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets).

Eventually the ambulance arrived and I had surgery the next morning which involved a metal 'pin' being inserted in my leg. I spent four nights in hospital in total. (I had never had an overnight hospital stay, surgery or broken a bone before)

I was discharged in the morning a few days later and spent the whole day on the road back home (My Dad came to pick me up, I was not driving!) with my leg across the entire back seats hoping we didn't have to stop suddenly, only to have to register with a local hospital once we got back in the evening which took several hours.

I have been more or less housebound for those three weeks and will probably be for a good while and I can barely move my leg. The doctor told me in 4-6 months, once it has healed or started to heal I will still be walking with a bit of a limp.

2022-08-18 22:47:25,9,True,2,"Me M20 friend F22 (lets call her Girl), we went to same middleschool and highschool, she remembers me from middleschool and I remember her from highschool and we are basically door to door neighbors. But we never spoke to each other bc i was a fat kid (im no longer fat, im now decent looking) and she was and still is a very pretty girl. We started talking at the end of last year and decided to go out as friends for drive in her car, time passes we go on a few more ""dates"" and talk about how none of her bfs didnt buy her flowers and then i decided to buy her hella flowers, we talked how im a virgin and she will teach me stuff as a joke, she did tarot and astrology girl stuff but that didnt rly bother me that much and im saying that bc she was always and when i say always, mean always right about everything she says, and after some more dates we kiss.

 She decided to break up with her bf of 5 months. We continued to kiss and cuddle and i continued to buy her flowers, cute stuff like that but like fwb. She got her own apartment and i basically stayed there every night. The sexual tension rose and one night we agreed that i massage her and i lost my virginity there, we stayed fwb but loved each other, bc she didn't want a relationship with me because i dont have a job and did not go to collage and basically saying I don't have my life together on what i can kinda agree (the job situation is weird bc of some problems in my family but i wanted to do delivery for like a year its a long process which is payed rly well here but Girl hates that job), she is going to another country next year, shes rly toxic, she doesn't want to get attached... After the first sex we rly went nympho mode for like 1 or 2 months and she said i was her best sexual partner ever (shes been with i think 6 guys) and kinda didnt belive me i was a virgin before her jokingly, we really had deep feelings for each other and loved each other and we have sooo much in common, we even said we were probably ""soulmates"" but we were never in a relationship. 

Anyways she needed to go back to her parents place bc she needed to save money and she doesn't like to live with them so almost the whole mood changed, we had arguments every 2 or 3 days. I decided to go to collage this year bc she said that it would rly be good for me but knowing shes ALWAYS right i decided to bail it and decided to go to Netherlands for work at a start of the next year (which i dont even know i will at this point), I got sick for like a week and had a crash on my bike that i wanted to do delivery for, and another week of not seeing her and after that she got rly distant, she decided to get distant with sex also with me (she says its not me its that she doesn't want to fuck anyone which idk but sure) and it kinda hurts me bc my love language is physical touch but okay, and today we started talking about how i dont work and if i rly wanted i could and she cried whilst sending a voice message that im gonna fuck my life up and stuff like that. After that i told her i rly started to listen to her advice but she told me its too late.

And i really think i fucked up here because i didnt listen to her for work, collage and for a bit smaller things, because i disappointed her and that rly bothers me and i cried today and every time after a fight bc (alone in my room ofc lol) bc i always think its my fault and thats weird because i barely ever cried before. She lost all physical and ""mental"" interest in me which is kinda sad because i still love her bc shes my first love and she showed me what love feels like and i know shes very toxic bc of the past relationships and childhood but i still lover her bc of the love she gave me, and most importantly she genuinely cared about me and i have a big knot in my stomach that its all my fault which i know it is but like EVERYTHING. Anyways my question here is what should i do next, i want to get a new bike and start the delivery job bc i rly like it and she says i should get a real job. Should i even talk to her about it, should i stop contact completely or continue talking i really dont know and i need help THANK YOU FOR READING

tl;dr is the title

I work night audit (overnight) at a motel. Last night right after I got to work, a call came in from a guest telling me that someone was calling out for help in the building across from them. I went down to check it out, and found a guest who had fallen in their room earlier in the evening, unable to get up. They said that they had recently been in the hospital for several months and had only been out about a week, and were literally too weak to get up off of the floor. I helped them up, got them sitting on the end of the bed, and we chatted for a few minutes. They seemed very relieved that I showed up, and expressed how grateful they were to not be ""left on the floor for dead"". We had a chuckle at that, I made sure they were all set, they thanked me for my help again, and I continued with my night.

They were found dead this morning by housekeeping, right where I left them. They had slipped their shoes off and leaned back where I left them, but didn't make it through the night.

Should I have asked just one more time if they needed me to call someone? Should I have risked bothering them and checked on them a little while after I left the room? Should I have just called an ambulance right away? They were alone. I left them alone, with their assurance that they'd be alright, but knowing they were vulnerable. And they're gone now.

I feel responsible. I feel a deep, gut wrenching, soul crushing loss for this person that I didn't even know existed 24 hours ago, and only interacted with for a few minutes.

He’s a nympho to an extreme degree, he used to hire escorts before he met me and he gets anxiety if he doesn’t have sex for a period of time that stuff, i never judged him for his past and i was more than happy to give him what he wanted when he wanted it. And then he ruined it. I’ve had a bad few weeks mentally and have been laying in bed all day so we haven’t had sex as much, i can tell it’s been rough on him but he’s there for me and he supported me trough it. Well we had sex a few days ago, first time in weeks, and after i came back from cleaning myself up he had anxiety, i was gone for maybe 15 seconds tops to get a towel, i asked him what was wrong and he just said ”just started thinking about the things i did before”, i didn’t push it further. Well, that same night after he went to sleep i started having problems with our router so i decided to check it out, and then i saw his search history. He has been active on an escort website, chatting with other women and looking for people in our area specifically. Now i am a huge overthinker and my mind immediately went “he’s slept with an escort and that’s why he had anxiety right after we had sex”.

2022-09-12 03:01:03,1,True,2,"I am 20 female and I was in a relationship for approximately 3 years with X. 
I met him when I was 16 and he was 17. 
I had moved to this new city and didn’t know anyone in the area or at the school. 

I am not the most trusting person when it comes to making friends so I really took my time to build and choose my friendships.
I now wish I did the same thing for this relationship.

He was very open and helpful while making me familiar with the area, the school, the people… He is a well known person in the area and has a lot of friends. 
He comes from a very wealthy background and is privileged in many ways. He would also make it known that he knew he was “better” than the rest. This rule didn’t apply to me in the beginning. 
I also didn’t seem to pick up on this behavior or maybe I chose not to see it as it made me feel special. 

The first two months were like any normal relationship. Corona came on the 3rd month. Complete isolation from any kind of social interaction made it even more impossible to make new contacts in this new place. So there I fell in the trap. He was the only constant person in my life at this point. I would spend any free time I had with him. Calling for hours, meeting up when it was possible… which brings me to one of the big mistakes I made: didn’t make any friends. 

Just like that the first year went by. It was a relatively normal and calm year. However don’t be fooled as this was only because of the restrictions Covid brought. 

Second year came and everything this relationship once seemed to be, came crashing down. 
He was all about socializing (which I understood after all that Covid took away) but this enthusiasm wasn’t to be experienced by me. He became this different person when I even came close to proposing an idea where spending time with others was an option. I wasn’t supposed to meet up with girlfriends, go out ( God forbid I did that ) or even go on family vacations. Going out in his words was an act of lower class and didn’t suit me as the person I was.
Well guess what? This stupid excuse worked like a charm for months… I already didn’t know anyone to do stuff with so why bother risking a fight with the only person I knew and had a relationship with? I now look back on this and feel extremely stupid.

Summer 2021 was an absolute hell on earth experience for stupid me at the time. I cried every night for 2 months. He would go out drinking, partying and would disappear for hours. Not letting me in on anything he did. I knew in the back of my head that he was cheating, but I ignored the thought. Cause WHY ON EARTH would someone who loved me this much, who was this jealous cheat? Well they do. 

There was this girl he had contact with on and off, they met up a couple of times and would call or chat frequently. I will refer to her at a later point. 

Besides the going out problem there was also something else: his problems with two different girls.

- He was being sued by his ex for pushing her to commit s.
- He was sued by a different  girl claiming he had sa her. 
- 
 These claims appeared in July. I didn’t believe them at first, but I would learn the truth in a painful way. 

We had planned a getaway of 4 days at the end of summer. We stayed in his seaside appartement and in my mind this was the moment to “fix’ things. 
I had a very low alcohol tolerance at this point as I didn’t drink frequently. He on the other hand was a heavy drinker. We had some drinks at the appartement and I fell asleep. I woke up naked from the waist down, while he was trying to do his thing. I was very shocked and didn’t know what to say at first. You don’t really want to believe it when bad things  happen as you think it is impossible for someone to be like that. I sat in silence and didn’t scream, cry or shout. I asked him why, he broke down. He acted like a little child and pleaded with me for the rest of the night. I forgave him. Call me stupid go ahead.



Summer ended and the relationship became really nasty. I started not obeying him all the time and this prompted a lot of problems. I think my behavior changed because I started to lose respect for him after that night. It really made me think about him and his actions. I felt disgust when I looked at him and everything he did pr said annoyed me to the core. 
2022 came and as summer approached, the relationship was at an all time low. I wasn’t feeling like living through another summer full of crying and he wasn’t planning on doing the same by giving me more freedom.

Before exams started I learned the on thing I always knew: he had cheated. That was it. Something just clicked in my head and I didn’t want this relationship or him anymore. 

I took a brave step towards the girls in my class and got to know them. This one particular girl and I got on very well and she invited me to her house and we went out together. I didn’t even think about him when I made that decision. Didn’t go as expected: he broke up with me. 

I can’t begin to tell you the sense of relief I felt when I read the message. It was short and he didn’t explain it further and I frankly didn’t care. 
Everything went silent for a week. Purest form of peace I had felt in a long time. 

I kept going out and befriending new people.  
He became this ugly monster trying to destroy everything around me. 
He would call me daily, send me messages and switch between pleading for forgiveness and threatening me and my family.

He would send me video’s of people getting shot and told me that would happen to anyone near me.
He threatened my friends and everyone who came near me. 
He told me he would ruin my life and sue me for using him for his money.
He told me he would send me a receipt for everything he bought me and that I would have to pay it back.
Mind you he is talking about the gifts he got me.
Shoes, clothing, books, food he payed for when we went out to eat… 

This verbal abuse continued throughout my exams. I ignored it and I truly didn’t care one bit. 
While this all went down, I became very close with my friends brother and we started dating.

X didn’t know it yet but suspected it. I refused to tell him because I didn’t want him to threaten the brother as well. 

This one night I crossed X when I was out with my friends and the brother. He goes up to my friends and starts saying these ugly things about me:  that I used him for his money, that I wasn’t sincere about my financial situation…

He told them about all the times he payed for stuff, the gifts…
Now keep in mind this boy knows about how difficult my financial sit was at the time. 

2 days further and everyone in the area believes him and his goldigger storyline. 

None of the friends see me in the same way and I stopped talking to them. 
My reputation is totally ruined. I don’t know what to do. It feels like he got what he wanted and I feel out of control over my own life. He took my social life away from me. 
Guess what? 
After he was sure that people didn’t want anything to do with me, he finally left me alone…

Even on our first date he made sexual advances towards me. I was stupid and didn’t know much about relationships so I gave him countless chances after that and I’m stupid for that because that made additional pain. As our relationship progressed he crossed physical boundaries and that lead to so many arguments. He would call me “asexual” and verbally harass me for not wanting to have sex with him. In one example, I was crying from the stuff he said and he tried to shove my hand down his pants and he would say “you see??? you have no reaction”. I don’t want to explain another example it’s more disturbing but in that case it involved my chest. In his cycle of abuse he caused he would apologize. He would try to show how sorry he was by taking me out to dinner and buying me stuff. I was so stupid for being victim to that cycle of abuse. I came to terms that I was abused sexually, emotionally, and mentally. We ended up breaking up which was a real blessing. I feel like if I stayed with him it could of lead to something so horrible like being r*pe. From knowing him I can see him doing that to me. Fast forward to now I’m in amazing relationship with the love of my life and I’m so very happy. I noticed that my ex has a new girlfriend and weirdly enough I feel upset.

2022-09-24 00:32:53,5,True,3,"His name is X. It feels like he just doesn’t care about anything other than friends he had before me or pot. Early into our friendship, I went to his house for my birthday. He smokes pot, while I don’t. I try not to judge and his parents know. So long as there’s no way I can get into trouble, I don’t mind. We could have stayed at his house, but he took me to another part of the city to meet a friend. He wasn’t lying, but he didn’t tell me he intended to smoke pot on a rooftop. Two officers came and asked what we were doing - obviously we said we were just hanging out but they said they were there to stop people from coming there to smoke pot. Thankfully nothing happened but they did take our details. To me, that’s never a good thing. I don’t like to play the race card but I’m a black. I feel awkward around the police as it is. But my brother has been stopped and searched by the police several times (he’s not a criminal by the way and he was let go every time), and as my mother often says, “Don’t tempt fate”. If the police had searched my friend, we would have been the bad guys. I can’t prove that I didn’t know he had pot, or that I didn’t want any. I was very angry with him but ended up apologising. I struggle making friends, and I didn’t want to lose him. While he forgave my temper, it took him 5 years to understand.

There’s a saying. You are who your friends are. Well while there are some lovely and interesting friends, a lot of his friends are ambitionless and into drugs. He’s also friends with a guy who hates Jews. He’s B. I don’t want to go into it. B was once a mutual friend but he confided that unfortunate fact to me. It’s a poor mindset to have and to me, it’s like seeing your friend develop a drug habit. I don’t hate him. I just hope he gets better, though sadly I wouldn’t be able to convince him that what he’s thinking is wrong. He found more ways to be unbearable though because he kept on saying that if I didn’t do what he suggests, I’m not a proper adult. I found it manipulative and because he didn’t see a problem with it, I blocked him. 
Back to X. I don’t like the company he keeps. Even if I did, I’m playing second fiddle to it and all he really wants to do is blaze it and vape. I feel invisible around him and it’s ironic, because he ditched his first girlfriend for making him feel the same way. I feel guilty because he has actually helped me out in life, though the favours have not gone unpaid for the most part. Still I felt like I was wasting my life towards the end and didn’t feel lucky to be his friend anymore. I wish him well. We’re still Facebook friends. I didn’t block him so there is still a chance I can make peace with him.
X has been there for me, but it feels like he doesn’t care all that much, and that I would have never achieved anything fun or meaningful with him.

2022-09-24 23:19:31,13,True,0,"I (24F) have been with my boyfriend “John” (25M) for 3.5 years. We’ve been living together for over a year and are generally very happy.

As the title suggests, some of the interactions between John and his sister Katie (20F) make me uncomfortable and occasionally strike me as inappropriate. I’m not sure how to handle this situation. I’ve talked to John but he refuses to address it with Katie, and I don’t know what to do next. Ultimately my resentment and annoyance towards Katie is continuing to build, and I’m sure that it will start to heavily impact my relationship with John if something doesn’t change soon. 

My primarily ick is that Katie LOVES touching John, particularly on his chest and stomach. She’ll twirl her fingers in his chest hair and comment about how big his muscles are, or she’ll squeeze his stomach and comment on his abs. Sometimes, when they’re sitting next to each other on the couch or something, she’ll just put her arm around him and run her other hand over his chest. This behavior doesn’t even stop when John is shirtless, like at the beach etc. She’ll also do things like cup his face with her hands, and she likes sitting on his lap even when there is adequate other seating available. At least one of the behaviors I’ve listed happens every time they’re together. 

In addition to the touching, some things Katie says make me uncomfortable. For example, when she refers to the three of us taking a photo together as “John and his girls.” She also talks a lot about her cleavage when we’re around. 

I’ve tried talking to John about this, but he maintains the position that because Katie is his sister and not a random other girl, it’s not weird. I believe that even if he doesn’t think it’s weird, he could at least respect that it makes me uncomfortable and try to discourage the behavior.

So I come to you, people of Reddit. Any advice on how to re-approach this topic with John? Any tips on what I could say to help him understand my level of discomfort. I’d prefer not to be the one to broach this topic with Katie since we are not that close, but if you think that’s the best course of action, please give advice for that as well. 

One last thing I would like to add is that John does not reciprocate any of this behavior with Katie. He doesn’t touch her other than customary hugging, he doesn’t comment about her body, and he doesn’t refer to her in any way that could cause confusion as to whether or not they are siblings.

I have been dating my boyfriend for 2 years 4 months. He has a fantastic relationship with my 7 yo/ ASD and my son loves him. We have a decent relationship with each other but I always feel there is something deep missing and I don’t know if it’s my need or something I can marry him and therefore commit to live my life without. We are planning to move in in 8 months when his lease is up, he will  move in with us, right now we spend each weekend together with my son and our friends (camping, exploring, bowling, hanging out). 

The time we get just the two of us is always after my son is asleep and we watch survivor or play Rocket League (video games). I have dated a lot of passionate people and I am a deeply loving, affectionate, and passionate person. It always feels like we are hanging out as friends except when having sex. 

There is a deep intimacy I have tried to communicate I feel is missing, I am learning maybe he just doesn’t function like this, it has caused many, horrible fights. So I feel I cannot ask anymore. It’s the type of intimacy where you lay with each other or are touched and I feel connected and loved. 

The largest way this presents is talking about the futures he will get uncomfortable (but says he’s not) and make jokes and then if I push, get very angry that I can’t force him to do anything. This isn’t my intention this is wanting to know I am not wasting my time with my son, I am not used to not having the passion so this ALOOFNESS leaves me feelings insecure and lacking confidence in his feelings. (There is some abandonment issues there from adoption just for background but I feel at 31, I am asking for a mature conversation in the right way. 

Secondly, I know this is a controversial topic of other peoples phones. I have been cheated on quite a few times and found out through social media, I am aware this is trauma-based and try to calm my anxiety in my head/ without talking and never search through his stuff with the exception of a few terrible fights we have had where I asked, he let me but caused a lot of lasting grief in this area in our relationship. However, now, whenever I go to get his phone to look at the time, music for my son, whatever it is, he looks over my shoulder he says “I’m making sure you are staying where you said you would be. You’re using it for music/ look at a menu not anything else”. So he is obviously setting a clear, personal boundary regarding his privacy and I want to believe it is just this and the respect that comes with my respecting it, however, I am scared he is SO protective that he is hiding something and I do not want to be hurt, or be wasting my and my son’s time. So I essentially, feel anxiety when he acts like this, knowing this pattern from past men, but don’t want to end our relationship but arguing about it or looking when I’m not suppose to. For instance, last night half-asleep I was feeling around between us for my phone and grabbed him (eyes closed down by my leg) and he shot up in bed and asked what I was doing , I told him feeling for my phone, and then he slept with it in the crook of his arm the rest of the night. It was a huge exaggeration but maybe he was partly asleep. I don’t want to be a fool and I also want to have a long-standing relationship and believe this man when he tells me he loves me and is choosing to be with me, would never cheat. 

So in conclusion, (sorry for the long post) : loneliness when I say romantic and true feelings “I can’t wait to have a life with you where I am taken care of, I can take care of you, stroke your face/beard while you fall asleep (he loves this), cook good food and love each other and my son” and he replies “I can’t wait to stroke your beard, too”, it just MAKES MY HEART/STOMACH FALL, I feel sadness and disappointment, like why does everything have to be a joke? But then he says, you don’t get my humor/ you have no sense of humor / come on just laugh. So is this his way of affection or is this deep immaturity where I will NEVER get the loving verbal expression or intimacy I have had in past relationships, give to him, and am craving? Also, the phone issue. 

Ps. He does dishes, buys food for me if asked (not spontaneously but super nice/ I choose to do this spontaneous and bring it to his work so again a difference in our personalities, and he “does” things as a form of affection I think, also his texts are VERY affectionate but never his words. I’ve told him my love language is verbal affectionate, he doesn’t seem to care or isn’t capable since it has been over two years.

all of my life my brother was the favorite child. he would get everything he’d ever want and my parents would always take his side. even when he was clearly the one hurting me and actually doing physical damage towards me (e.g beating me up for no reason, body shaming me saying he’d have a group of his friends come over to our house and kill me etc.) my parents always pushed this behavior to the side only because he has behavioral issues. a couple days ago i finally snapped. we had just started eating dinner and my brother had already been insulting me and being rude and calling me fat and told me i didn’t need that much food (i had a large piece of chicken and mashed potatoes. i’m 116 pounds and a bit chubby, im 5’1) he was pouring some orange juice when he accidentally spilled some and i chuckled on accident. (i forgot to add that i was extremely hungry and hadn’t eaten anything that whole day yet.) he got mad and yelled at me saying “how would you like it if i did that to you” and i stayed silent.then he got up and poured his orange juice all over my food and yelled “is it funny now?” i was so pissed. i hadn’t even gotten a bite of it yet, i was trying so hard not to scream and become violent that i started crying and i lost it. i threw my plate of food at him and pushed him out of his chair and kicked him and ran to my room shutting it and locking it (he’s 120 pounds and i can barely move 60 pounds) later on he came knocking at my room door yelling at me to clean up the mess i made but i just ignored him. i may have overreacted but that’s okay i guess. my parents said i overreacted and then i got so upset i relapsed on sh. and i had no one to talk to this about becuase i felt i needed to isolate myself.

I(28F) and my ex (33M) were working in a remote place and ended up falling in Love and started dating, it was serious and long term, hoping to get married, but we couldn’t reveal to anyone about our relationship coz work wise the consequences would be very bad and would lead to problems in our personal life. I was very serious about him but few behaviours were huge red flags, so somewhere I strung along without giving any indication that I was having doubts about the future of our relationship. 



1. He would get extremely jealous if anyone ever hit on me or got interested, now I’m not bad looking and I do end up getting a lot of attention from men, I don’t cross any lines and don’t entertain that either but everytime it happened he would just lose his shit and start blaming everything on me, it was extremely hurtful. 



2.Another thing was that he’d always remove his work frustrations on me, it was just super annoying and tested my patience. 



3. The final straw is he would really hype himself up and even lie about stuff. 

Anyway I got transferred to a diff city temporarily and within a month of moving I lost interest and in another month I broke up with him, it’s been 4 months now, he didn’t take it well and kept asking to get back together, so a while back I started dating someone else, and ended up telling him that coz he was annoying me so much , he just lost his shit and thinks it’s wrong that I moved on and started blackmailing me with our intimate pictures which he had told me he had deleted, after much drama and me lying that I’m not dating the guy it subsided and he apologised. This was a month back. 

Cut to two days back he’s now asking me to let him perform oral sex on me one last time, I’ve refused and tried to make him understand so many times but he’s adamant


And he just keeps saying I promised and back tracked and he suffered a lot so He will make me suffer as well and that I have no feelings and I should not be able to lead a respectable life I’m just so tired now idk what to do, he still tries to control my life

My girlfriend(20) and I(22) have been intimate for a while now and we have a great relationship overall. We have tried various things and I consider the both of us open minded .

She recently got more comfortable which I like. She started calling me “daddy” a lot more , which honestly doesn’t bother me. It isn’t something I like but I don’t care that much either.

Turns out the “daddy” thing doesn’t just stop there. She actually sorta changes her voice to this infant thing and likes to get into the role playing seriously. It honestly creeps me out and isn’t something I like at all. I went soft.

I spoke to her about it later and for some reason, she feels as if me pointing it out is me saying something about her personally. She pointed out that she has always tried everything I wanted, etc…

Safe to say, we haven’t been intimate since (1 week). She’s been distant ever since too.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm struggling with an addiction to Braxien porn and I was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to stop. It's really taken over my life and has had a negative impact in a lot of ways. 

&amp;#x200B;

I first started watching it out of curiosity after seeing some ads online. I then became really interested in the content and started watching it more and more frequently. It got to the point where I was spending hours every day looking at Braxien porn videos and pictures. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's been really tough to try to stop myself because it's something that I really enjoy doing. But I know that it's not healthy for me and that it's affecting other areas of my life. For one, it's causing me to spend less time with my girlfriend because I'm always either watching porn or thinking about it when we're together. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also find myself getting irritated easily and having a shorter fuse than usual because I'm constantly thinking about porn when I'm trying to focus on something else. It's just really hard to resist the urge to watch it when it's so easily accessible.

My birth was traumatic, baby was in the NICU (for a few hours) due to my emergency c-section and him being hypoglycemic. Baby was given donor milk in the NICU. We had to keep giving him donor milk until mine came in. I started pumping.

My milk came in and I was able to feed, but my husband insisted we get more donor milk ""just in case"". Then he would pull a bottle from the freezer and ""we might as well use it"". I put my foot down, we compromised one bottle a day and I would otherwise breastfeed and freeze pumped milk.

MIL came to help us out the second week we were home and offered to let me nap after. I asked to be woken up the next feed. She noted she could just prepare a bottle and not have to wake me up, but I was clear I only wanted him having one bottle a day and that was at night so I could sleep. I woke up was told MIL had prepared him a bottle to ""let me sleep"". She had no idea how much he should be getting. The next night I prepared his one bottle, then woke up after pumping and noticed a second bottle. I asked my husband about it and it became an argument about her trying to help and me needing to sleep.

2022-10-24 16:39:07,5,True,1,"Sorry for the long build of context, but it’s been racking my brain for too long and could really use some insight. When I (now 30M) was in high school, one of my longtime childhood friends (now 30F) had a crush on me. She invited me to a party she was throwing over this last weekend and during so, invited me to stay the night. We slept together that night and again the next morning. Most of the night’s conversation between us was spent with her repeating how much she admired me back then. I’m a little self conscious because I’m a shadow of my former self in terms of physique so this was not an easy conversation for me but I indulged. To be honest it was actually even a little much at times that she would bring it up. That said, I was really optimistic about what the future might hold between us and felt really excited that we had such a good time. I don’t know if it’s something I said, but I keep coming back to a comment/joke I made the next day when I was about to go home that might have upset her. Keep in mind our entire friendship has been filled with sarcastic banter back and fourth so a joke towards the end didn’t seem inappropriate. (Sorry for the TMI) I didn’t bring condoms so I made sure not to go too far in terms of climaxing in her. One of the last things I mentioned was saying my stomach hurt because I didn’t climax and had “blue balls”. Shortly after, we said our goodbyes, kissed each-other, and I went home. I know she’s been through some really bad breakups and can’t help but wonder if it made her feel self conscious. She had even said during sex that she felt a little self conscious, to which I reassured her I thought she was very attractive. So it’s either that comment or it’s purely just a lack of attraction on her end. What bothers me is just the thought that I might have hurt her feelings to the point that she doesn’t even want to talk about it. For context, she kind of went off the deep end with keeping to herself and constantly going to the gym when her BF cheated on her a few years ago, and I think she jumps to conclusions a little quicker as a defense mechanism to protect herself. Anyways, I want to try and save our friendship if I can. Especially since we live in a smaller town and will likely run into each-other in the future. The problem is she’s a very guarded person and is just not opening up. She barely spoke to me the rest of the weekend. I finally asked if she preferred we just stay friends. She said she had a good time but does feel we should stay friends. I don’t think there’s much more I can say that will allow her to open up and be honest, or if I even should keep pressing the subject. Lastly, to be completely honest, now I’m super self conscious about myself thinking she was maybe grossed out by me. I haven’t had a great last few years and have dealt with a fair share of rejection lately. Also lost my mom to suicide a couple years ago and my love life has been pretty spaced out and nonexistent since.

Like you could throw me in the dead sea, and I would still sink faster than a ton of steel the size of my fist. So when I pick up on something, it’s got to be *really* obvious, and right now, I think I’m feeling some tension between a friend and myself. 

So I (F) have this friend (M) who we’ll call Lynx. We’re both in University and have been friends since high school. I always joke that my friendships are like fireworks - they’re fun and exciting but only last for so long. Fortunately, I’ve had a few that I’ve been able to keep in touch with and literally just two that I regularly talk to. Basically, I’m severely lacking in friends. So the three of us make a fun little trio. Lynx is one of those two. 

Lynx and I have a good friendship. We have the same types of humor, have similar interests, and are down to try new things that the other person likes. We often text in passing about random things and also make a lot of s3x jokes and jokingly seem like we’re in love. Neither of us is bad looking either. We both sit at like a solid 7/10 - give or take on good days and bad days. I also know that Lynx liked me at some point during the early stages of our friendship since we talked about it years later. 

Now here’s where I’m starting to fall apart. I have a high s3x drive, but I’ve also never done it. I’m super embarrassed to do it. Like suuuuuuuper embarrassed. I even popped my own cherry because I didn’t want whoever my first time is to know it’s my first time. I don’t think I’d know what to do in the moment, and with hookup culture, I don’t want to do it with someone I don’t know and have them make fun of me. But dear god, I want to try it so bad.

Lately, Lynx’s and my text have been stepping past where we usually play and have been more extreme. Even though I have a high drive, I don’t get turned on too easily. But, one of the texts he sent suddenly had me gushing so hard that it would put Niagra falls to shame. This has literally never happened before. Obviously confused, I did what any person would do and sat and contemplated my existence. 

As mentioned, Lynx and I are close friends and have talked about literally almost everything. So, I know that he also has a high s3x drive but also hasn’t done it yet. For better or for worse, I also know he’s hung like a literal horse. 

He’s coming to visit over the long weekend for school break, and we have plans to hang out. Part of me wants to ask him if we could try something (and by try something, I mean please let me try sucking the literal soul out of you) because I’d feel comfortable and ok doing it with him. I have a feeling he has some similar ideas/feelings and that he'd probably agree, but I also don’t want to mess up our friendship or have it be awkward afterward. 

Also, remember that I mentioned that Lynx is one of two that make my little trio of consistent friends. I don’t want to end up putting my other friend in an uncomfortable position, even though I know she’d just brush it off and joke about it with me.

I was sexually assaulted at work a few months ago and it's pretty much messed up everything. I've been in weekly therapy since then but I still feel like I'm not back to normal. I have a lot of trouble initiating sex now or accepting sexual affection. I still love him very much, we've been together for over a year. I feel like I've been trying to piece my life back together since that happened to me though and he's struggled to understand a lot of it. I ended up quitting a job that I loved and I've been trying so hard to still meet his needs as a partner.

Today, we had an uncomfortable talk about it that ended in him saying ""I can wait, but not forever"". It very much felt like an ultimatum. We HAVE had sex since it happened, several times... Just not as much as we used to. I don't know what to do or how to fix things. He also asked me what I am actively doing to work on this/fix it and I didn't really know what to say. I go to therapy every week and I make an active effort to push my comfort zone as much as I can.

2022-11-24 00:49:52,98,True,545,"The original POST: [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/z272ip/my_idiot_boss_just_lost_300000_dollars_over_30/)

Please brace yourself, this is going to be long

Today I was in an all-day meeting regarding this issue, and many things happened.

Before, I have to make some clarifications. For starters, I meant 300k. In my county we use the numeric system 300.000,00 instead of 300,000.00 so that’s why.

Also, important for the story is some background:  How the company usually operates is that they buy the product from many small producers and then sells It for a bigger price, my commissions are calculated as following: (Price of sale – Price of purchase) \*10%.

However, a few months ago some of the product that was bought was contaminated with an antioxidant, this makes it considerably harder to sell and it was sitting in a warehouse waiting to expire.

For this reason, and to incentivize sales, management decided to eat the cost of that purchase as a loss and give to us in sales a commission based only on the price of sale (meaning 10% of what we sold of that product)

Now, for the last month we have actually made much more money from commissions, and this benefit will last until the product is sold out.

When I made the sale for 300k, my boss (who isn’t management, but rather sales coordinator) was pretty upset, because it meant that he (and the rest of the team) will have less commission. He actually tried to stop the sale from going throw several times before his idiotic act of rejecting payment, but I had stopped him.

Now, regarding what happened yesterday, the sale was finalized the day prior, the client had accepted the quality, (which is usually the hardest part) and was ready to make the payment in the morning. So, the morning comes, and my idiot boss rejects the first payment right before lunch and does not tell me. Then, he talks to the client while I am at lunch so, when I come back, I do not know what's happening. Then, around 4pm he rejects the second payment in front of me and that’s when the client loses his mind, calls my boss, and tells him there is no business.

I tried calling the client, but he didn't answer me. I learned from the after sales representative that this was in fact the second payment rejection. I just could not believe that my boss would put his job in danger just to screw me over. At this point I don’t confront him, I just go home.

Now, in the evening I receive an email from the office manager (my boss’s boss) saying that there will be a meeting at 8am to discuss the complaint from the client. I arrived at 8am to the meeting and it’s only the office manager, the CEO and me. The CEO starts telling me: “before I fire you, I will let you tell your side of the story”. That’s when I tell them everything, and the CEO says, “tell that fucker (my boss) to get in here now.”

Apparently, the client had decided to file a formal complaint to the office manager but forgot to mention that he was complaining about my boss and not about me. and When the OM saw the 2 emails rejecting the payment, he thought it was my fault and immediately told the CEO about it.

When my idiot boss walked into the meeting room, the CEO yelled at him about being so idiotic and putting his own interest before the company. My boss then replied saying 3 things:

1.  He didn't personally send the emails rejecting the payment, the poor 20-year-old girl that works with us in after-sales did. And he did not give her the direct order to do so, she just misunderstood his comments about how the client should assume the cost (This is total BS)

2.   He has an email from the Office Manager where he specifically says that the bank fees are too high and that he should look into reducing them, this apparently was proof enough that there was no wrong doing on his part. (This is also BS)

3.  He thinks that it was really unfair that I would get such a big commission at the expense of the rest of the team. He thinks it's better for morale in the team if we all get a piece of cake, instead of only me. (Definitely more BS)

After many hours of back and forward between us, the rest of the team and even the client, many accusations, and even tears the following was decided:

The CEO fucking somehow is convinced that he shouldn´t fire the idiot, but instead they decided to fire the 20 year old girl who couldnt even defend herself.

The CEO personally apologized to the client, and got him on board with the business again, but at a discounted rate and with no commission to me (I was punished for not being aware of what was happening with my client)

I will get a bonus of $8K for getting the client, but no commission from sales to him, and also my commission rate will be increased in the following year to 15%

My idiot boss will keep his position, but he will have no commissions or bonuses (everyone discovered he had many bonuses for dicking around).This pissed him off so much he quit on the spot.

The Office manager casually tells me that the now open position of sales coordinator could be mine.

My now Ex-boss then decided to tell the CEO that the sales team was not selling the product before because we knew that they would increase the commission rate if we waited. This pissed the CEO so much, he demanded to see all negotiations in the past months, starting with my client. 

I almost got fired for starting my negotiations with the client after the commission was increased, needles to say the promotion is now definitely not mine. I just didn't get fired because almost every member of the sales team did the same thing.

What a rollercoaster of a day. For all of those who suggested I should quit right away, I am thinking about it, but a 15% commission rate sounds way too good to me. I will have to wait until the end of the month to see if they keep that offer after what happened. And also, who is going to be my new boss.

For context, my bf has looked through my phone before at the beginning of our relationship. He discovered i had a hidden folder with pictures and videos of my exes. He was super upset about this and demanded I delete everything and block them all on social medias, which i did. All the stuff in the folder were from before my bf and I started dating. 

Today, my bf was sleeping and i decided to go through his phone. I saw texts between him and a girl that he hooked up with on multiple occasions. The last texts were 2 days before he took my virginity. I checked his instagram and he still followed her and liked her most recent pictures. 

Now, i’ve had many boyfriends in the past and it was always my plan to save myself for marriage. My bf, when i met him, told me that sex was really important to him and that it wouldn’t work out between us if i wanted to wait for marriage. I ended up losing my virginity to him 1 month into talking. He told me i could trust him and that i wouldn’t regret it and now both of those things turned out not to be true.

2022-02-19 04:12:48,4,True,4,"Hi everyone


Me (M22) and “Hope” (F22) had been friends since freshman year in high school. We became best friends between sophomore year and junior year, especially since we really connected because of similar psychiatric conditions


During our early best friend years I realized how really emotionally damaged she was. She had body image problems and was very insecure. Both her siblings (M and F in their late 30s) ended up drug addicts in emotionally unstable relationships, her parents have been separated but living together for various years, and they’re both mostly normal people.


During junior year we started smoking weed everyday after school, half the time with her 50 something year old tweaker aunt in her crack den apartment. Her aunt, of course, had junkie friends. Hope ended up hooking up with a 40 year old married junkie (friends with aunt) for about a year, she was around 16 and I tried to get her to stop. Her sister and her aunt got Hope into meth until she had to stay in the hospital for a week because of an intense schizophrenic episode. (I am schizotypal). After that she broke things off with the older man and her aunt and stopped doing meth


Later on (all the way up to when she ghosted me) she had temporary affairs with older men. I always wanted to help her somehow, but she always knew she had daddy issues and didn’t seem to want to change it. Her affairs were never emotional, it was always sexual, although she always dreamed of falling in love someday and being a typical 50s housewife with children


We also had another friend “M” (same age). M and I were close but we relied on Hope as a bridge. M and I were Hope’s best friends but the two of us were not best friends


Towards the end of 2019 she had a hook up with another married man and I noticed she became unusually distant. By the start of 2020 she stopped talking to me or would take days to reply. When we went on quarantine she told me she had met a (then 29 year old, we were both 19) guy towards the end of 2019. That’s when I knew he was the reason she was distant. They met through a phone game. During quarantine she traveled to his state to meet in person and stayed for about a week. She came back to our state and brought him over to live with her in her parents’ house


I met him through zoom one day (after a while of Hope not talking to me) and I could see he was a junkie, especially because of his skin. He was standoffish but not rude. She confessed to me that he was a very jealous guy and I automatically understood how toxic he is. The very few times she would text me it was behind his back and very quick texts, just saying hi or replying to very old texts


I stopped trying to contact her because I felt like I couldn’t help her out of this relationship. I know how romantic and fragile she is, and I was very sad I couldn’t help her. He got her into drugs again. One of the last times I saw her in person she was very skinny and no longer hiding her body with baggy hoodies and black leggings. She told me she was pregnant but I didn’t believe her because she would often make jokes like that. The last time I saw her in person was on her porch. She came out behind her boyfriend’s back and we had to speak in a low tone and she was smoking


After that we just stopped talking altogether but then she texted me when her baby was born early last year. He was a premature baby and had to stay in an incubator for a little while because she smoked and did drugs while pregnant. That was the last time we spoke


A couple nights ago I hung out with M and met her new boyfriend. Hope had also ghosted her and we were both very hurt. After we met up she texted Hope and Hope asked M for my number. She said hi to me yesterday morning. I didn’t know if I wanted to talk to her but ended up saying hi hours later. She just replied early today and M and I suspect she’s doing it behind her bf’s back again. I don’t know if I should keep replying to her texts. I was very hurt and never had closure but I feel like she’s trying to reconnect and I’m not sure I want to anymore

We started to have hookups every so often. I never developed any feelings or thoughts about dating. Until this last time. 

 We hooked up this last time. We never had any intimate conversations. We usually have small talks about school, work, and similar interests. Except this time during sex and after sex it felt more intimate. This was the first time he asked questions about my dating life. He opened up about his past relationships. We started to talk about our history together and how it would be if we actually were serious about being in a relationship with each other because it was odd for us to keep going back to each other. 

I don’t know why this time it was different than any other hookups. I know our relationship can’t develop any further but I can’t stop thinking about our conversations.

To occupy this space a moment: A physically male body also makes urine to flush toxins and whatever else, but physiologically cannot create the same process that female ejaculation does. I can “squirt” (awful phrase) only if I am very well hydrated and then can fully void my bladder and ejaculate within a minute of peeing. Trace elements of pee, yes of course it’s in the same space pee is stored. 


From a feminine perspective: we are creatures made mostly of water, we are created and develop within fluid of the womb. The act of creation itself is undulating, rhythmic, fluid, tidal. Metaphor. Poetry. Sacred. Come on! 


To judge, label, criticize, shame, and dismiss are practices that in conjunction cut us off from an open heart space no matter what the topic. I don’t feel like it would be too bold to query that an open heart is a good goal to have? 


To belay the answer based in fear: We endeavor to learn from our pasts, but to live in perpetual response dooms us to recreate those wounds. 


Labels like male/female feminine/masculine are heavy in the collective consciousness right now because the wounds we experience in life can make things difficult no matter who we are or what labels define us. 


Personally, I think a lot of us have a wounded relationship with the more intimate/spiritual/feminine inner realm of being as it coexists with the outer masculine realms of a global society that is performance, fact, logic, and achievement-based. Each of us contains these feminine and masculine qualities, an inner and outer world that searches for balance.

2022-02-21 02:00:15,0,True,3,"Ugh, here we go ...

I have, what I consider to be, a life long masturbation addiction. I realize masturbation is a normal and even healthy activity, but for me, I feel like it's turned into something else entirely. 

It started after I was sexually abused as a young child. It wasn't violent or anything, thankfully, but still definitely abuse. Through the abuse, I learned about sexuality and was taught to masturbate, which I did, a lot. I didn't really think much of it when I was little. I remember showing my friends and trying to get them to masturbate with me, like it was this fun, social, everyday activity and I wanted to share it. At some point I realized this was not typical behavior and I became deeply ashamed. I remember being 10, maybe 11, and getting so mad at myself because I couldn't stop. I tried, several times, but would always come back to it. Eventually I started pretending it wasn't a thing. I learned to hide it. To push it deep down to the darkest parts of myself. I put a wedge between it and my everyday life. A wedge that would eventually fracture my self into two.

The addiction continued to thrive through my teenage years and I used it to escape a whole mess of trauma. Got into partying and heavy drug use, a kid in our friend group murdered someone, my best friend killed our other good friend drunk driving, lots of stupid shit happening all around me. Worth pausing for some context at this point. I'm from the US, grew up in middle class home, and at a glance, our lives were all totally normal. My parents separated when I was young. I'm not sure I understand what was going on in their lives but at a young age, my sister and I, learned to fend for ourselves. By the time we were teenagers our parents were completely checked out and we did whatever we wanted with zero supervision.

Thankfully, I was able to drag myself out of that rut. At 17 I started living with and taking care of a dying family member. I didn't realize it then, but it was the first time I was living a somewhat normal life. I did everyday things like cook and clean. I took her kid to school and got her to her Dr's appointments.  It was cathartic. I started to distance myself from the unhealthy lifestyle I had been living and the enabling friendships. I eventually got a job and began setting myself up for a career. It wasn't enough to pull me away from my addiction however.

As luck would have it, around this same time, the internet came along. With it? You guessed it, porn. My addiction grew up faster than I did. It grew teeth and latched on like a parasite. I became two people. The me that was growing up, finding success in my life through a career, making good money, making great new friendships, and the me that would use work computers to leech porn, go home, binge, and work on my neck beard. 

And this has been my life for a while now. I'm almost 40, almost fucking 40. I've learned that I've been using this addiction as a coping mechanism. It's the escape from all the shit in my past. And, it's self feeding. I masturbate, feel like shit, and then masturbate again to feel better. So stupid. It's also my go-to to celebrate success. Yay, feeling good, time to masturbate. Ugh. I can't escape. I've learned that as a kid I never properly learned how to cope, or how to celebrate. The culture in my family was always don't ask, don't tell, don't share feelings, don't do shit. Did something bad? Let's pretend that never happened. Something bad happen to you? Let's pretend it never happened. Do something great? Neat, let's pretend it never happened. Even now that I'm an adult my parents still act like this. They know now that I was abused as a child and have never once broached the subject with me to understand why and how it happened, or at least offer a, sorry that happened to you, sorry we weren't there to protect you.

I've always been a bit up and down with my addiction. At times things seem not so bad and others it feels awful and overwhelming. At this point things are all time low. I've been working from home for a bit now and it's extremely aggravating. Most days I will spend 3-4 hours, during my work time, masturbating. I can't believe I haven't been fired yet. It's insane. It's so embarrassing and shameful, I feel awful. Other areas of my life are starting to fall apart as well, adding to the stress. I know I probably need to talk to a therapist. I've done this a little bit in the past, it sort of helps, for a short time at least.

2022-02-23 23:54:22,3,True,2,"Hey everyone, this is going to be pretty long-winded, so if you read all the way through you're a real one, and I appreciate it.  

Last week, my girlfriend (19F) of 2 years broke up with me (20M). We met before we both started college (in the Fall of 2020), and have been together ever since up until last week. Every moment that I think of her it hurts. I really love this girl and genuinely believed we were going to get married. I'll go into detail about why we broke up, and the circumstances surrounding our relationship, some of which involve our sex life, hence the NSFW flair.

We met online in the spring of 2020 and started dating, knowing that we would both be going to the same college out in Utah (where we both live now) that ensuing fall. We did the whole long-distance thing that summer, and It legitimately felt like a movie. We are both from two different states, so we actually flew out to visit each other that summer while we were both still living at home. Again, bear in mind that we're young. We met when we were both 18.  

Everything was going well, although there were small issues here and there once we started going to school together and being around each other all the time, they never separated us. As we got more and more comfortable together, I felt like I was always felt like I had someone to lean on, love, and I would always know she loved me. I had my own friends and whatnot, but my girlfriend was my best friend. We shared everything together. We would visit each other's families, go on trips together, share TV shows and movies with one another, sleep together almost every night, etc. *Almost* everything I did, I did with her. I've never been away from home or in Utah without her. Now that she's not here, it feels like I'm living in a different universe. 

I still do love her, and it hurts an unbelievable amount when I remember that I can't see her or talk to her right now. When we broke up last week, nothing has felt the same. I wake up with shakes, oftentimes have to vomit, and nearly everything reminds me of her. I have continued to put one foot in front of the other, however, because I know nobody is going to catch me if I fall. I've been going to the gym, taking care of myself, dressing nicer, staying away from alcohol, and working so unbelievably hard to change the things that caused our breakup (more on that later). 

So, why did we break up? 

Well... a few reasons. Let me start with the biggest. I have been suffering, since I was maybe 13 or 14, with a porn addiction. It has absolutely ruined my life and my relationship. I was spending money on it, consuming it probably twice a day, and the worst part was that I would hide it. I wasn't honest about it with myself let alone my girlfriend or those I cared about. When she found out, I downplayed how much I was watching it, but then she found out how much I *really was* consuming it, and it simply crossed a boundary. Because I wasn't honest about it, she considered it a form of cheating, which I couldn't live with myself to think that I did, but I understand completely where she is coming from. My girlfriend recognized that it was an *addiction* much like an alcohol or drug addiction, but because it infringed on her trust in me, my ability to reciprocate and enjoy actual sex, and crossed a boundary with her, she decided she didn't want to be hurt by it anymore, and I completely understand.

She broke up with me two days after she found out, and at first was willing to work with me on it, but decided it would be best to separate. I have been seeing a therapist nearly twice a week, and it has helped me immensely. I've been seeing him not just for my addiction, but also to deal with the pain and grief of losing someone who meant so much to me.

There were other, smaller issues, too. I believe that she legitimately saw me as her future husband, and held me to some very lofty expectations that I would sometimes inevitably fail to meet. Spending habits (which were compounded with the whole porn issue) were a big drag. I've struggled with that, and she saw that as a red flag. I can see why. I've relapsed into some bad spending habits that have strained me and her trust in me. She would also sometimes make it feel as if her love for me was conditional. For instance, if I inevitably faltered and messed up on working towards a goal I had, she saw it as a red flag. If I didn't want to go to the gym on a particular day, that was a red flag. If I didn't fold my laundry right, that was a red flag, and a disagreement would start. I have no doubt that her love for me was, and still is unconditional, but sometimes her actions and words would suggest otherwise. I have gotten so much better at so many things across the board over the last two years, but sometimes I feel as if I don't get credit for them, or as if she has to help me and look over my shoulder, which chips away at my self-esteem and confidence I need to fix my issues on my own. Basically, I felt like she treated me as a project in many ways, not as a loving and caring boyfriend. She has been dealing with anxiety for a large chunk of our relationship, which probably contributed to control issues. She was seeing someone for it and will start meds soon, so maybe it's something she'll get better at. I'm not a therapist, but it sounds like anxiety, and a boyfriend/future husband that needs a little ""tweaking"" here and there isn't the best combination. 

I have put my best foot forward since the breakup. I have been incredibly upfront and honest about my porn addiction issues. Before, I wouldn't even admit it to myself, but now, I'm open about it with just about everyone who asks about our breakup. I've quit porn cold-turkey, been seeing a therapist twice weekly, been building confidence in myself with changing up small things like the way I dress, the way I take care of myself, forcing myself to go to the gym consistently, and keeping better track of my spending... but it still hurts like hell to not have her here. I have only contacted my ex-girlfriend to get my stuff back out of her room, but other than that, not at all. I'm giving her the space that she needs, after all, my addiction issues really, really hurt her, and there is a hole in my heart knowing that I made her feel a way she didn't deserve. 

Our breakup conversation lasted all of maybe 10 minutes. It was not angry at all. It was amicable, and we hugged each other and told each other that we loved one another. I have no doubt there are still very, very strong feelings between us. I asked her point-blank if there was any chance we could get back together and while she said ""anything is possible, but I would need to get over the hurt I caused her."" She didn't completely shut that door on me, but my heart sank and is still sunk, knowing how what I did made her feel.

When I texted her maybe 4 days later to ask for my stuff out of her room, she responded with a very respectful and nice lengthy text. She said that when I'm ready to talk, she'd try and make that work. I want to get back together not because I'm lonely right now (although I am) but because I know that it *can* work between us and we can both add so much love and happiness to each other's lives. That can happen only when she is ready (if ever), and after I have fully worked through my addiction issues, fully apologized and take responsibility for my actions, and commit to making trust and honesty a priority. I know the kind of man I can be, and the kind of love I can provide her, as well as she, provides me. Hell, I did a pretty good job of it for 2 years. If that is a road she is willing to go down, I would start *slowly*. We would have to start from square one and not pick up where we left off. We would have to go out on small dates again, sleep in our own beds, and live our own lives for the most part, until we could regain that trust in one another. Trust regained in me that I can have my life together without her looking over my shoulder, and trust in her that she believes I have **made** (not promised or said to make) significant changes. I also want her to physically feel better in our relationship by having a better and more fruitful sex life **eventually** (that will come with the removal of porn from my life).

I am not ready for a conversation about our future yet. I'm thinking it will have to be after at least a couple more weeks of no contact. No relationship is saved out of pity, and that is not how I intend to save this one. We haven't spoken (other than that one conversation about our things) at all since our breakup, and I'm looking to keep it that way for a little while longer. She opened the door for me to reach out when I'm ready, so that's what I'll do. 

I love this girl with my whole heart, and I know that things like porn addictions and spending problems don't define me as a man. I am bigger than that, and after I make it clear that I have cleaned up, I want her so bad to go down this road with me because I do see her as my future wife. If not, well... then she can go find another man and accept less. 

I know that someday I will be able to love again, whether that be in a few months with the same girl I love now, or at some point in the future with someone else. It has been an incredibly heartbreaking and painful week for me, and I want her back in nearly any way.

2022-02-23 23:58:31,53,True,302,"As some of you know, I’ve been hanging with my coworker for a few weeks now. It’s been a lot of fun but disaster finally struck today. 

I was fooling around with said coworker in the parking lot before work this morning and not to get into the details of it, but he was finishing orally and he popped out of my mouth as the act was ending. I think it was half my fault for not committing to accepting the result and half him leaning backwards from feeling pretty good. 

That popping out resulted in me getting hit in the right eye, followed by some absolutely searing pain. I fell back, nearly hitting my head on the door to his car, going legs over head. Full on somersault almost. I should have entered the Olympics. Naked girl tumbles in car. Gold medal for participation. 

Essentially it looked like I took a shotgun blast to the face at close range, but you know, in an overly dramatic fashion. It didn’t help that I was naked at the time so I think it was all about as opposite as sexy as you could get. 

My coworker was a gentleman and helped me get cleaned up as best he could with a towel he had in his car, but we had no water or anything liquid so I got dressed and quickly ran into the building we were working in. Of course, the women’s bathroom on the first floor was still locked. Just my luck. It was also almost time for work to start. I almost ran to the elevators. My eye was still burning. I waited and waited. It wasn’t coming. Elevators, am I right?

Finally I ran to the stairs. I heard the elevator ding but it was too late. I committed and ran up the stairs. Of course, being half blind I tripped on the landing and completely ate shit. Full on crash and burn. Skinned my knees and everything. I got up and kept running, making it the second floor. I felt like my eye was getting worse and worse. 

It was not supposed to hurt this bad, it was not my first time certainly. 

One hallway later I was in the bathroom and quickly washing my eye out with water. It still burned. I looked at myself in the mirror and my eye was bloodshot red. It still hurt like hell. My vision was completely blurry and everything still felt a little sticky in the eye lashes. 

It also was time for me to go to work. 

I went into the office and immediately got asked what happened by a variety of coworkers. I just said it was an allergic reaction and I got something in my eye. I put sunglasses and continued to go about my business. But my eye just let hurting. 

I tried to wash it out a few more times but the pain was still there. Finally, I looked in the mirror again. My eye was now swollen red. It looked like I had been punched. 

I went to my supervisor and told her I think I needed to go to urgent care. She was highly suspicious until I lifted my sunglasses and I got a full on “oh my god, yes please go. Are you even able to see?”

My hesitation lead to a coworker giving me a ride asking a lot of questions about what I possibly could have gotten in my eye to cause such a reaction. I felt my cheeks matching my eyes in red coloring. 

Finally made it to the urgent care…only for it to be closed. The next closest place was the emergency room and now my eye was unbearable. We went there. 

After an hour and a half wait I finally made it in front of a doctor. I had to ask my coworker to step out of the room before telling him I got semen in my eye. 

Thank god for professionals. He didn’t bat an eye. He said I most likely just was having an allergic reaction but I hadn’t properly cleaned my eye so the longer it was in there the longer it was going to hurt. 

A much better rinse and some eye drops later the pain immediately lessened. I guess the moral of the story is…don’t get sperm in your eye? There are several other great options I would recommend prior to the eye. 

Stay safe out there everyone!

2022-02-23 23:59:37,6,True,1,"hey all, throwaway because my bf uses Reddit. also apologies for the TMI

so i normally have a hard time finishing from oral (and sex in general). i have been able to finish from oral a total of 4 times ever in my life. 2 of those times were from my bf, who i have been dating for 6 months. he knows i have a hard time finishing but we both know that does not have to be the end goal so we still enjoy ourselves.

however, the 2nd time i finished from my bf (last night) he brought something up to me. when i receive oral, it's almost like an instinct for me to grind on his face and that is how i finished. he always encourages me to do so, and he's never had a problem with it (that he's brought up to me at least). after i came down from the high, he told me he felt like he barely did anything and that i basically made myself finish by grinding myself against his tongue. he looked and sounded so disappointed when he told me that, i felt bad. i reassured him that it was him that made me finish since he was still using his tongue. no doubt the grinding felt good but his tongue movements were definitely helping. i told him that as well but he didn't answer me and went to bed.

i guess my question is, how do i make this right? i grind when it feels really good and i want more, so i thought he would like that i finished from that. that, and the fact that he encourages me. do i stop the grinding? i'm just lost.

TLDR: my bf felt bad that i grinded against his tongue to finish during oral

2022-03-01 01:29:14,11,True,5,"Every relationship has pros and cons , but is sex a good enough reason to stay? 

My partner and I started off as FWB - so sex has always been a big part of our relationship. We have great chemistry and same high sex drive so its been working great for over a year now. 

We are now talking about moving in together and he has basically 'locked me in'

however from my end there are a few things which I know I need in a relo which he cant give me: 

\- hes a decade older so he doesnt like going out , prefers ordering in etc

\- hes an introvert so again prefers being at home rather than socialising 

\- I love to be spoilt, but in this relo its more equal (I guess thats good but deep down I yearn for a man to treat me like a princess and spoil me/take care of me) 

\- One of my love languages is physical touch so I love to be close but sometimes i feel like im being too 'clingy' and so I feel like there is an imbalance of how much love I give and show, and how much he shows me 

\- he doesnt 'believe' in a lot of society values so I feel he is very sinister  at times whereas im so carefree - eg he didnt get me anything for valentines day because he doesnt believe in it.

I feel like our relationship is very 'practical' - we tell each other what we like and the other wants to give it to them. I want something more exciting tho - i want the thrill of going out on adventures and being so in love with each other that the whole world can see . But at the same time this man gives me some of the core things I want in life: 

1. we both have the same financial goals in life (we are actually starting a business together)
2. we both smoke so we chill out and do random shit 
3. we are in a semi open relationship, so I have been seeing other guys and my mans doesnt care. also we have had a few threesomes as we both love girls. I dont imagine having this freedom in any other relationship (my past has always been closed relos and very controlling men) so I am enjoying how I am having the best of both worlds at the moment 
4. ofc the sex is incredible 

So is sex and the other values above a good enough reason to be in a committed relationship?

2022-03-07 19:44:49,0,True,1,"Alright Reddit strap in for this one.
So let’s get the characters out of the way.
Dad(50’s), mom(50’s), brother(20), sister(27), girlfriend(24) and me(23)

So here’s the backstory before the event. I guess you could say I am mentally Ill as I have been suicidal since 14 years old. The reason is my mom is bipolar and I had a really rough childhood. For example moving around a lot, living in a homeless shelter for a time, a lot of mental abuse, some physical abuse at points where she blacks out from rage. (An example is she beat both me and my brother with hair clippers because the clippers were broken and every time we moved because it pulled our hair she would hit us in the head with it.) she would apologize for the actions and as kids we felt bad because we knew she was sick so we tried to make it ok which screwed both of us up in our own ways and etc etc. so ever since 14 I moved and lived with my dad but the psychological/mental abuse was still constant from my mother and she turned her side of the family against me saying I left them and my brother and sister resented me for it, which made me and my brothers relationship go from close to nonexistent. My dad had his own demons that indirectly effected me. He is an alcoholic and every memory I’ve ever had of my dad, he is drunk. Always has been. It’s gotten to the point where I don’t even notice it, I just assume he’s drunk every interaction we have. He has gotten better this past year and went 6 months without drinking which is great but then when he heard about what happened he got wasted and funny enough doesn’t blame me or himself but my gf but we will get back to that. So over the years I would make attempts here and there with bleach in food, taking way to many pills, and recently poisoning myself with mustard gas. Also fyi all these years this has been going on my family never knew of my attempts until recently. But basically they didn’t know until 2-3 weeks ago about all the attempts and in their eyes I was just sick often and still was working and going to school because I would “tough it out”. I ended up quitting school and working in a arcade industry as a technician. I worked for 50-60 hours a week and it was a 3 hour commute there and back. I pretty much was overworking myself as another way I guess to exhaust my body and after 5 years of doing this I found my wonderful gf. She really saved me and it made me stop and  actually value life. She made me actually have a reason to live but of course there’s a catch of over working and it took its toll on me and I ended up just stopping. I quit my job and did nothing but eat sleep and play video games. My gf was there to support me for the year that I took off and this is when I made my recent suicide attempt and here is where the story starts.

When I stopped I decided to blow all my money and do whatever I wanted and then end my life, so I did exactly that and when the time came I broke up with gf to try and get rid of her. she was heart broken but in my mind I wanted her to forget me so she would have it a little easier. But she didn’t let me go and she stayed with my sister for a week to give me space and I planned on using that space to end it. I googled how to make mustard gas to go in my sleep but I ended up surviving and living through it. My sister came to check on me and again had no idea and just assumed I was sick. Anyway I had decided that I wanted to live after that attempt failed and that I needed someone to talk to and from my family history I couldn’t talk to my family because I knew craziness would ensue. I finally confided with my gf and told her everything (fyi we were already planning on me proposing and stuff and my whole family already saw her as my wife and even called her my fiancé for a year) she obviously panicked when she found out and ended up going to my family which I don’t blame her for at all because she didn’t know how to handle the situation. But the reason I didn’t go to my family is because I know allllll of them are crazy. So I spent a few days in the hospital and my family made my gfs life a living hell. They wouldn’t give her any privacy, they blamed her for not knowing what I was going through, they made her feel like an outsider, and they made sure to make her not feel safe in her own home. (We live together btw) so while I was in the mental hospital recovering this was all going on and she didn’t know what to do because if she told me what they were doing to her, I would go yell at my family and then they would yell at her for stressing me out saying She’s making  the situation worse. So 2 weeks ago I got out of the mental hospital and we had time to regroup a bit but my family wouldn’t let me and her be alone. I understood you know me being alone because of what’s happened but I didn’t understand why we couldn’t be alone together in our own house. (Btw I own the condo) so that was annoying but I let it be when I shouldn’t have and my gf is trying to hang in there with me but obviously she can’t because my family won’t let her. So me and her decide we both need to go on vacation. I told her she should spend time with her god parents for a bit and let them know everything so she could have someone to talk to and I was gonna go to Florida with my brother for a week. Honestly the vacation ended up being a great idea as me and him relaxed, and rehashed our relationship and our bond is much stronger as he read my suicide note and said he’s felt the same way and wanted me to know he’s neutral and just wants me to get better. I’m glad it happened. Now here where things fall apart, my parents made a spare key to my house that they informed about in the middle of the week while I was already in Florida. I was mad but understood it was a just in case because of the events (my gf was also unaware of this btw). While I was mad I was doing my best to understand where they were coming from and trying to keep my gf calm about the whole situation. So they had this key and asked me if they could paint my cabinets and have a cleaning lady come in and clean the house so when I get back from vacation it would be a good welcome. I foolishly agreed more because even if I disagreed I felt they would do it anyway so why not just let them do it right? Well…… I find out that they removed all of my gfs furniture and paintings and left them outside for 3 days uncovered…… now what furniture? Oh nothing except our living room couch and oh our king size bed in our bedroom. Now you think they would call and tell me about this right? Well you guessed wrong. They didn’t say a thing until my gf who got back from her vacation sees her $6000 worth of furniture outside. The excuse, the deep cleaning lady ended up breaking our bed so they put it outside instead of in the basement which they thought was locked. The couch went out there as well because “it smelled like piss and the deep cleaner couldn’t get it out” so they threw that outside as well. (note there is no lock on the basement door….) But wait it gets better they replaced it all with cheap couch and a full size bed. Maybe a queen but I just know as I am 5”10 that my feet hang off the bed sooooooo I don’t think queen lol. My gf thinks it was intentional which I am inclined to agree because all that furniture was in her name but to us it was ours not mine or hers. Funny enough the house still has stains all over the carpets so idk what kind of deep cleaning we got but the lady broke our bed (supposably) and our house got organized a bit not even cleaned so not worth at all. I told them off, hard to the point where I pretty much said I am disowning them and that they can’t control my life anymore I don’t want there help and etc. the whole family has turned against my gf and everyone is saying my gf is terrible for me and is controlling me and etc. but if it wasn’t for her they wouldn’t even know and once more maybe one of my future attempts would be successful. I feel like I shouldn’t disown my family and feel terrible for saying all I did but I feel there is no choice left but to disown. I had to threaten them with the police to get them to stay away and with what my gf provided she could easily get a restraining order but I told her to hold off because I’m not sure what to do. They are making me feel like I used them for their money and time when I didn’t ask them to do any of that and I appreciate the cabinets being painted because it looks amazing honestly just everything else went so horribly wrong. But again my mom apparently broke bank moving all the stuff in and out of my house and the cleaning lady and now they feel I don’t appreciate anything they did. I obviously want everyone to get along but my family is making it clear for me to choose a side and I choose the side that I believe is best for me. Because honestly I think she is the one saving my life. But they are saying she is controlling my life but even if that’s true I can’t see it. Maybe I’m wrong though and all these gestures I’m dismissing and just wasted both my parents time and money for them trying to help me, I honestly don’t know what to do because I love my gf very much but I don’t wanna lose my family over it.

2022-03-07 19:53:26,22,True,1,"TL;DR didn't enjoy the sex too much wanted a kind way of telling him how to improve 

Relationship Context: 
We aren't dating just close friends. It's just casual fucking we both made it clear it's not a relationship and agreed we would stop if we met someone we wanted to date. We're both happy with that. 

Situation context 
It was his first time having sex so I kept my expectations low. I have more experience. When I asked him to go down on me he would but he would finger me way too much or just abandoned the oral part and fingered me. I'd already spoken about that before but he was nervous so I understand. I got injured during the sex because he was going pretty rough and it slipped out and just about missed it (not good for either of us)
I haven't ever cummed doing stuff with him(not much with previous partners either) and he hasn't with anyone  which concerns me. I've spoken about this with him too.

The condoms I got were too tight which didn't help (ended up letting him go raw because I have an IUD and we aren't seeing anyone else) 

Im never close to cumming with him which bothers me and after a bad sex life with my ex bf I wanted something more satisfying. He knows this because he's heard about my sex life (with permission from the other party). He said he knows it's not great yet and he just needs time to get it right which I believe but Im still a little upset. 

He's good at the foreplay but he's just a bit too rough and that has the opposite effect. Im insecure because he said that the other girls weren't this hard to please (that wasnt unprompted I made a joke and he told me not to apologise for being picky and that it's ok). I honestly just want to cum but it only works when I do it myself. It's starting to become exhausting. 

How can I communicate that without upsetting him or coming off rude?

Edit: I talked to him and he said that I'm not being rude and it's okay and not to worry. And he just needs to do better (not in a sarcastic way in a genuine way) and he doesn't take it personally. He said that just because the other girls were easier doesn't mean it's your my fault and that I don't control how ""easy"" I am.",relationship_advice,I F18 got injured during sex (M18) how do offer constructive criticism?,11.5,2022-03-07

The guy who brought it had his own joint, while me and the other friend decided to smoke one bong together. It hit us almost instantly - about one to two minutes in we were totally stoned. In fact, he was so fried that his girlfriend who was there with us had to comfort him. He was sweating, and as he said to me a few days after smoking - at one point, inside of his head he was thinking he was dead. He told us not to say anything when anyone asked him how he was feeling, and vomited about 2 hours later. When it comes to me - when trying to walk, it felt like I was really drunk. When sitting, I could barely control the shaking of my legs and I felt my heartbeat really intensively. This trip lasted for about 4.5 - 5 hours.

I read a post on here about someone ruining their cheating BF’s life. And I hate that I’m not strong enough, I was a child when we got together, 13 and he was 18, he was abusive, he would hit me, pinch me, press down on my arms til it hurt, but he would make sure he never left marks. He would coerce me into giving him oral and letting him touch me. Saying it would make him feel better, I’m eighteen now, and in later October I dumped his abusive ass. But I wish I’d been able to do more. I wish I’d been able to take him to court, to make him admit what he did to me, to ruin that stupid perfect life he had. But I can’t, rich parents, and I’m a poor girl in a southern state, who are they going to believe? Certainly not me, I wish I could tell his parents everything, but they don’t deserve that, it’s not their fault their son is a monster. He used my religion against me, my own words, my own mind, my feelings everything.

2022-06-12 03:17:08,22,True,0,"I need help. I’m running out of patience here. I’m 21F and my boyfriend is 21M. We got together first when we were 16 and have been on and off since then. He’s the only person I’ve ever been with romantically, sexually, emotionally, the whole nine yards. I am not his. Our 2 year (consistent) anniversary is coming up in august. In the beginning we formed a friend group, including this 20M who is both of our friends. 

Before moving from Pennsylvania to Florida, we became closer to this friend and we hung out as the three of us, and even started a business together. He moved with us to Florida. We are on year 2 of living together with additional roommates. They still work on business together.

This is the thing. My sex drive is higher than anything and my boyfriends is not. We have sex once every other month and I cannot be satisfied. I am so horny all the time and I have a hard time thinking about if I marry my boyfriend that my life will be like this forever and I won’t ever get with anyone else. It also has a huge negative effect on my self confidence. 

On top of this, I am attracted to our friend so badly. I fantasize about him day and night and he’s given me hints that he’s attracted to me as well. We have sexual tension and are flirtatious with each other and I can just tell what he’s thinking when we talk alone. I want to have sex with him so bad. 

Another thing to note is that I asked my boyfriend about an open relationship about a year ago bc I was not being satisfied with the amount of sex we were having and felt that I needed to get it somewhere else if he wasn’t willing to do so. He was extremely hurt and angry that I even mentioned it. But i wanted to be able to have sex with this friend. My boyfriend says that if I ever did anything with him even if we weren’t together, he would never talk to me again. 

AND on top of that, I am best friends with my boyfriends sister 20F. She was the one who introduced this friend to us. She is also moving in with the 3 of us next year and she likes this friend and honestly wants to end up with him and has recently expressed this to me. 

I am so so so attracted to him and I can’t imagine a world where I continue to torture myself with this fantasy. I need to just experience other people if I am not going to be having sex with my boyfriend. But if I did anything with our friend no matter if my bf and I were dating, I’d lose two of the most important people in my life. Plus he is very loyal to my boyfriend so idek if he would do anything. 

The point is that it is torture and I cannot handle carrying around this fantasy for my entire life bc I know he is going to be in it forever. I’m young, have such a high sex drive, and am not getting any. I want to be with my boyfriend but I also want to experience having sex with other people (just like he has). Especially this one friend. But I don’t see any scenario in my head where I could ever have sex with him and I know it isn’t worth it to lose these two people.

My parents are separated. They have been for the past 7-8months or so. Unfortunately it’s my dads fault. When I was younger I’d see them arguing a lot and my dad would cheat and lie to my mom constantly. She(35f mom) never did anything wrong.

They had an in and off relationship for 25 years until my mom left him, and kicked him out for good.

For example they can be happy for one second, they have a total mental break down, or get extremely angry as well.

I’m sure theirs different types of bi polar disorder.

He had known my sister for about 4 years and had known me and my parents for about 2 years. My parents were naturally not very happy about this and started all sorts of shit when they found out and went completely apeshit when they found out. The police did nothing due to the fact that my sister was at the legal age when they started dating. Me and my family did have several encounters with them though seeing as the instructor would call them on my parents claiming different things. One of these times he called them to tell them that she was being held hostage by my parents. When the police arrived however my sister wasn't even home. Every night I would have to actively force myself between my family to stop them from seriously hurting or killing each other. This continued for about 6 months before my parents threw my sister out of the house. Members of my family would often leave for hours at a time after saying they were leaving to kill themselves. The worst night of it was when my father had left and my mother locked herself in the bathroom with the medicine cabinet. I then spent about an hour banging on the door begging her not to kill herself. I never really recovered from those few months. 



Whilst the arguments at home were pushing me to my limits something else happened. My father had an investigation launched into him by the police accusing him of being a paedophile. He isn't. They dropped the charges after about 6 months as there was literally no evidence. The investigation meant that I couldn't even be alone in a room with my father in one of the most difficult times of my life.



A few months after this my sister moved back in with me and my parents because she couldn't afford to live with her boyfriend anymore. This didn't last however and was just more of the usual until my parents kicked her out again. 


After a while I (about 13 at the time) started speaking to my ""friends"" on a regular basis. I wasn't speaking to many of my previous friends at this point as we had lost touch over the years. Over the last two years of talking to these people I became an absolutely horrible person. I only ever treated people like shit and used them for my own means. That's generally what our group is all about. About a year ago I finally realised what I was doing to people and started actively making an effort to be a better person towards others. Most of the people who I treated like shit have forgiven me but I still feel terrible about what I did to them. I know that any pain I feel regarding it is deserved because i knew what I was doing. 



About 9 months ago I met 2 people, (C, male, 15) and (H, female, 15 at the time ,16 now). I got along with this pair better than the others and quickly became good friends with them when they joined the group. After about 3 months, C and H dated for a week, I got dragged into all of their arguments, I lost contact with H, became better friends with C, learnt what C had been doing, stopped speaking to C entirely, and started talking to H again. After a while I started falling out with the group as I had sided against C in an argument and stood up for myself when questioned about it. After their breakup H and C didn't speak though H did want to speak to C. Recently they have started speaking and in the week since they started speaking again H appears to have been convinced by C that I did something that C actually did. Something that would be a complete violation of trust. I didn't do it. I never would have. 



So that's it. That's pretty much my life story. I regret so many things but it's too late now to change it. I don't know what I'm going to do anymore and it's my own fault.

2022-10-08 05:49:04,3,True,2,"Let me start by saying that my boyfriend is typically wonderful. He's extremely receptive to my needs and asks very little in return. He isn't one to say ""I love you"" frequently, which is a little tough for me, but he demonstrates that love through his actions.

This week is our first anniversary. I recently moved into my own apartment for the first time and am missing most furniture and lot of essentials, aside from most kitchen tools. My boyfriend came over while I was at work and spent time tidying up the apartment and putting my things away. He even bought me some groceries and couple kitchen items I was missing. Like I said, he's wonderful.

Tonight was what we agreed was our anniversary dinner. I'm normally a very casual person, but I dressed up and did my makeup in a way I thought he likes. I felt really good about how I looked. In the evening I made a beautiful dinner: Steak, scalloped potatoes, and asparagus. We had a nice rosé to go with. He complimented the food, thanked me, no issues.

Well, after dinner I went to the restroom and when I came back out, he was asleep! It wasn't even 9:30, and he had talked about intending to stay up late. I tried to wake him up, but he's an abnormally heavy sleeper. He has a tendency to half-wakeup, say something about getting up, then fall asleep. I wasn't able to stir him, so I gave up and went to take a shower and change into some ugly pj's. 

We often have sex in the morning. He stirs, it wakes me up, and we cuddle up and eventually have sex. Even if I'm not really in the mood, 90% of the time I'm responsive because I'm extremely attracted to him and he turns me on. Morning sex is great!

My issue is, it feels like he only wants to have sex when HE is in the mood, and no amount of flirting and fondling, suggestive or direct, changes his mind. Sex makes me feel close to him, and being rejected so frequently is hurtful. It makes me feel like he's not really attracted to me, and only wants me when he happens to be horny (I know for most men, testosterone levels spike in the morning). I've mentioned this to him very briefly before, but it has not been a conversation.

Part of me feels guilty for being unreasonable, because he's truly a good person and considerate, loyal boyfriend. However, my feelings are still hurt. I went through a great effort to look nice for him, which he did notice and tell me I looked great, but I still feel like it was a waste if it didn't turn him on.  I hesitate to bring it up because I don't want to ask him for more than he already does. I also feel guilty that this bothers me so much, and wonder if my mind is placing to much importance on sex. 

For background, this is my second serious relationship, the first being an on-again-off-again 2 year relationship with man who did not love me, value me, or even feel attracted to me, who took advantage of my insecurities to soothe his own. This is also the first time I've celebrated an anniversary, so maybe my expectations were too high. Perhaps I'm projecting the issues of that relationship, even though it ended nearly 3 years ago.

For reference I (20NB) am mentally disabled. I'm autistic, anxiety prone, consistently depressed with suicidal ideations, and I might even have bipolar or be borderline. I'm also morbidly obese (I'm trying to lose some weight) which causes me to be unable to walk for more than 15 minutes, or stand for more than 10 minutes. At that point, I have to sit down. I can't work a regular full-time job. My psychologist and PCP have said so. It would have to be part-time and have accomodations to sit.

This all started back in either April or May, with my first and second disability denials came in. This only happened because I didn't know what the fuck the lady on the phone was talking about. I thought SSI and Disability were the same.

And then, in mid September, 3 more letters came in, all saying the same thing. Denied. We used my mother and father as examples, since they got social security disability income, and they denied us under their names as well. This was my third denial.

At this rate, I'm rightfully pissed off. So is my grandmother (who is my legal guardian), my DSP, my psych, and my doctor. We attempted to lawyer up, but the first lawyer we called said my case wasn't valuable enough (bitch.). The second doesn't do SSI/Disability.

I started joking ""Oh lemme just chop my leg off."" But honestly? It's not really a joke anymore. I need this money to survive. I have less than $150 to my name.

I applied for food stamps and was easily approved for almost $300 a month, but now they're asking for social security proof so that I don't get denied and lose it all. The one thing I can't prove. I don't even have the fucking food stamp card yet, and they already want to yank it away.

I wish I could fall into another major depressive episode so I sleep all day and wake up at night so that I can only eat a breakfast consisting of my portion of dinner from the night before and then go back to sleep in order to save money and food, but my DSP has thankfully prevented that.

2022-10-21 21:08:12,0,True,8,"At first glance this may look like another woman complaining about her cheating ex boyfriend, but trust when I say that finding out he (24M) was cheating on me (26F) was the least important reason I ended up our 5 months relationship.

Everything was nice at the begining, then after 4 months I started to notice certain distance from him. Besides from certain attitudes I wasn't comfortable with. (Nothing that important)

A month later I got to talk to someone very close to him, I couldn't avoid asking if they knew something I should be worried about, because I started thinking he might be cheating on me... That was enough for them to tell me everything I could've ever imagined.

He was not only cheating on me, he used to abuse his ex partners physically and mentally. He even spread one of his ex girlfriends nudes after she tried to break up with him...she was a minor, he already was an adult, and he didn't care. Lastly, he also tried to sexually assault one of his minor cousins.

I was beyond devastated, not only that person told me everything, his own neighbors and family confirmed it after I talked to them. All the previous comments I received ""jokingly"" from them about leaving him started to make sense. But why didn't they told me anything in a serious tone earlier? Because they tried that with the girl before me. 

My ex knows how to attract people, he knows what to say and how to convince everyone he is a good guy, and this poor girl thought he may have changed and was no longer they guy people warned her about. Obviously it ended up bad, I contacted her and she confirmed everything and handed me more proof from her side.

Then why my ex didn't do anything to me? Because my family works in the military. He knew he couldn't do anything to me or he would've ended up in jail for sure. So I took advantage of that. 

Some days later I confronted him about his cheating first, he denied it. Then I told him that our relationship was over because I knew about everything he had done in the past, that he was no longer welcome in my house and couldn't get near my family, and if he did, he would pay the consequences. 

He didn't say anything, he stayed still and only looked me in the eyes while I was saying everything to his face, then he only said ""I will leave"" and left. My sister was recording everything in case he got violent, one person warned me about it. Deep down I wished for it to happen so I would have been the last person he hurt before sending him to jail.

People have told me that I was brave, that I have moved on gracefully and that I deserve someone better, etc. But I can't avoid feeling incompetent, I couldn't do anything on legally terms because my ex didn't do anything to me beyond cheating. 

He has been lucky enough to avoid jail on his previous cases, he has not paid any consequences to his actions. And now he has a new girlfriend. If she's smarter than me she will notice the red flags and leave the hell out of that relationship. I didn't noticed them because he was my first relationship ever. 

It's been 3 months since I broke up with him, 0 contact, blocked him from anywhere. I no longer feel caring or some type of love towards him, I don't miss him. I'm meeting new people, I have fun, I'm living my life. People congratulate me for moving on...but the truth is I haven't.

I still resent him, I still wish for something bad to happen to him. I wish he rots in prison, I still imagine scenarios where I get to put him behind the bars, where prisoners will know what he has done to minors and do whatever they want with him. He doesn't deserve any good, he is a monster and deserves to be punished.

My class ended earlier than expected so I decided to go to Chick-fil-A for lunch. I was already feeling like I needed to go before that, though.

I also carry a pack of mints with me because I like to go through them. I go through them practically like candy.

I order my Chick-fil-A, got it quick as the building was relatively empty. Keep in mind I am a big guy, so I like me some chicken nuggets. My drink for this meal was a large Pepsi, about the same size as those gas station cups you use for the ICEE machine. My food was good, and I downed the Pepsi rather quickly. I had a mint to cover up my breath from the food as my parents were on the way. I know the way around campus well enough to find my way to each building, so I knew which building my parents would arrive at.

Suddenly, I feel my stomach rumbling.

Oh, boy. I guess the mint caused a reaction with the soda while it was coming down, because I needed to go. I quickly got up, deciding I needed to go somewhere secluded to take a shit. I left Chick-fil-A in a hurry after seeing some of my friends who were leaving campus. I saw that the library was close, and despite some of the bathrooms barely being used, I assumed this would barely be touched too.

I entered the library, immediately bolting towards the elevator. I hit the button for the fourth floor as fast as I could, knowing that it was a quiet study room. Someone with me was going to the third floor, but for some reason when the elevator got to the third floor, it didn’t close that fast. The ride was fast getting up, but damn, I needed to go and it wasn’t holding in any longer. The door opened, and I was within safety’s reach

I made my way to the handicap stall so people couldn’t see my agony. I stand over the toilet, my pants down, but it was too late. My shit was fighting to get out of my tightly clenched cheeks, and my shorts got caught between my legs. Luckily, my ass was over the toilet, so I was able to get it on as soon as shit started coming out. 

Unfortunately, that explosive shit didn’t all land in the toilet after I realize that it somehow missed my pants. I turn around and notice that shit hit the porcelain behind the seat and partly on the wall. I grabbed toilet paper and those brown paper towels and did my best to cleanup the shit. 

Here I am, sitting on the toilet in my house, remembering there is a bathroom in the Chick-fil-A. I could have avoided all of this if I remembered about the bathroom.

TLDR: I took a mint after drinking Pepsi and eating lunch that my bowels were trying to shit it all out like those explosions. I speed walked all the way to the library, hoping I could make it to the bathroom.

He's now in a relationship with two kids of his own and I've respected that because I don't want to be a homewrecker and have tried to move on. 
Here's where I need the advice. Jake has come onto me more than once since he's been in his relationship asking for intimate things or to see me ""get off"" which I've always rejected. There was one time years ago when I got tired of hearing him ask for stuff and as an attempt to get him to stop I took off my top for him, which I regret now and I know I was wrong for that incident but I just wanted him to stop asking for stuff.

I'm a 25 year old woman, I gave birth to our daughter when I was 19. We have always had a pretty good sex life, I was happy with it. Ever since I gave birth to our kid, I've had problems with gettting to orgasm alone just by intercourse. My husband is very well aware of that as I have told him almost every single time we finish our routine. But somehow he just straight up ignores it. I suggested to him to do other things, like rubbing the clitoris or just by taking it slow and actually making me wet. Lately he seems to just care how he feels during the intercourse. At first, I thought the excuse that he was tired was actually credible so I went on with it and didnt want to bother him even more. Now he straight up just asks me if I want to go have sex and to join him in the bedroom. I would gladly accept because I really do enjoy sex in general and it makes me feel good. For quite some time now, he would always leave me hanging. I would literally be seconds before climaxing, he would finish before me and would just walk away to go clean himself. I just stay there like he used a freaking sock or something. I went on without a climax for a month, sometimes even two. Then I realised if he cant satisfy me, why should I wait. So I started to sneak and masturbate when I am alone at home. I am not a person who would cheat and find someone else just because something is not right at the moment. Im a very patient person and sadly very quiet. Now that he found out through conversation that I masturbated, he has been ignoring me ever since. Im crying in the bedroom because I feel so bad but also feel mad that he's mad at me for something that he basically caused. Im not very demanding, I would never complain over every single thing. But I did give him hundreds of hints telling him Im not satisfied after our sex. He gets to get laid every single night, by the way. Im feeling disgusted by this whole situation and I dont want to act when Im mad so I will just wait it out. Nothing I ever do is good or right, I guess. I only know that I hate marriage and I miss being alone, I was a lot happier that way.

Just wanted to add here instead of replying to every single comment by saying how much I am thankful for all the advice  everyone has given me. It is very much appreciated. It helped me a lot. I am dostancing myself now and we will see how long it takes him to actually put the matter in his hands and man up and talk to me.

I told him about all the things he made me feel bad about, such as degrading and lack of interest in our marriage, explaining to him that I am not going for the money and luxury and all that I need is simply a little bit of attention and to feel like I am any kind of value to him and that he honestly appreciates me and everything that I do for him. We will work on our sex life as time goes by and he actually agreed to involve some other things into play and not just him thrusting until he finishes. I am very hopeful at the moment and I told him that I need some time for myself to process everything that has been going on since yesterday. He respects that and is actuallt behaving much better and is being more considerate towards me. 
If it wasnt for this subreddit and the people that gave me tips and ideas on how to handle this situation I would probably still be sobbing and crying in the bedroom not know what to do. So I want to take this moment and thank each and every one of you who took their time to post a sentence or two to help me get through this.

2022-11-07 20:20:27,0,True,0,"(Fake names)Last year me (19f) was dating Adrain (20m) for 5 months, me and Adrain were best friends in hs and in the same friend group. We dated in high school but broke up but started dating again last year. I also met Lilly (21NonB) in hs and they were part of the same friend group but me and Lilly were super close best friends, I could have trusted them with so much with anything. Me and Adrian were having some problems because he had a p0rn addiction that was hurting me in the relationship and still wasn’t over his ex, he broke up with me and told me I should seek therapy. I’d cry to Lilly for a week after the break up and tell them how hurt I was and they were there for me. 3 weeks after the break up Adrian came over and slept with me, at the time I did it because I wanted him back and he came because he was just in the mood. Then he just started ignoring me and I’d see him and Lilly always hanging out and posting each other which seemed suspicious, but I didn’t saying anything because I didn’t want to seem like a crazy ex. That was until my best friend since middle school Mary (21f) felt the same I did so she confronted them separately and told Lilly if there’s anything going on to tell me because it’s not right. I later get a call from Lilly admitting to me they been dating Adrian for 2 weeks behind my back, I cried and yelled on the phone telling them how he slept with me not too long after he starting dating them and how I don’t wanna speak to either of them ever again. The both of them got hated by the friend group with made everyone split. Mary still kinda talks to them(which idc because Mary is on my side and she has a kind heart, I just told her to keep them away from me), she works with Adrain and her coworkers told her that he was calling me a crazy ex and she defended me and now his coworkers don’t like him. I Can care less about him but I was hurt most because me and Lilly were best friends for 6 years and they threw it’s away for a guy? And I just wanna know why they hurt me especially Lilly, why me just why? Was I bad friend to you Lilly? I was always there for you and experienced so much with you just why? I tell people I don’t care about you but in reality it’s been 8 months since I blocked you and I just still wished I had answers even though I don’t want you in my life especially since I’m in a new relationship. My boyfriend even tells me it’s not worth seeing Lilly for answers because if they really wanted to see me they would have tried hard to. It’s just still hurts and eats me. Lilly and Adrain since broke up and Adrian has been seeing other people, Lilly currently doesn’t have friends that I know of and has tried telling Mary is was worth it.

2022-11-07 20:28:53,3,True,0,"To add some context, this all happened back in 2019 and 2020 before Covid took over. At the time I, 18-19 female, was having a lot of rocky relationships and I will admit that I was more than sexually active. 

After losing my purity and realizing that men actually do like women that wear a size 16-18, I became an absolute fool. I thrived off of the attention to the point to where I would be dating more than one guy just so I could get the praise and attention I was deprived of when growing up in an overly strict conservative household, especially one that idolized razor thin women.

One day, while going through Hily, I matched with a very handsome guy. He was going to school to be a lawyer and had a vocabulary that wasn’t expected from a 22 year old. To say the least I was hooked at how smart and caring he was and after a few days of talking we linked up and did the deed. The problem I faced after our time together was me knowing he finished in me and I didn’t know where to go to for a plan b. He pulled out but not soon enough. I was too scared to ask my mom because she didn’t know I lost my virginity and in a black household where the idea of your teenage daughter getting pregnant is frowned upon and you get talked about all under your clothes, it’s easier to keep secrets and not risk getting kicked out. I didn’t have many friends and my ‘best friend’ (and only friend at the time) told me to let her know if I ever need help with any form of contraception and I did. 

This girl tells me she doesn’t think the guy finished in me and that I would have nothing to worry about (be very mindful that I was and still am the very definition of GREEN and naive). I wasn’t sure how she can speak for me but like a fool, I didn’t worry about it until a month later when I missed my period. I brought it up to my friend and she says oh it’s nothing, you’re a heavy girl, our cycles can sometimes be late because of our size. 

Again I went along with it but only for another week. Panicking I went to take a pregnancy test, lord and behold I was fucking pregnant and when I finally told my friend, let’s call her Kelsi, she was angry. Angry because I had gotten pregnant very easily while she has difficulty conceiving. She was angry because I didn’t have to try for a child. My friend, 18-19 female is baby crazy and is a very self centered person who was also struggling with fertility. She had tried several times for a child but none of her eggs would stick. 

After her anger passed and she was done making the night about herself, she had the nerve to ask me to go through with the pregnancy so I can sign away all rights to my child and basically play the role of auntie. The kid would still get a chance at life and I wouldn’t need to worry about raising them. Because of how I was raised, I didn’t want to go with plan c. I wanted this child to have a chance but I couldn’t bring myself to go through with the pregnancy. I don’t have my life in order to support a child. I refuse to sign away my rights to my child and still watch them grow up not knowing that I’m their mother. The argument would’ve been you can tell him or her when they’re old enough but no. I’m too prideful for stuff like that and honestly my biggest fear would be the resentment I might receive from them for giving them up so easily. So I made my decision and went through this program I found online that sent two little pills. The experience was painful and I had to wear adult diapers for two half months. I was no longer pregnant by the end of January and I thought that would be the end of it.",TrueOffMyChest,My “best friend” told my mom about plan c and my relationship with my mother was almost ruined because of it,1.5,2022-11-07
2022-11-14 03:24:38,46,True,329,"  So for starters, we met in high school our freshman year. He was an amazing friend to me and even let me copy his notes when I would crash in science class due to low blood sugar (I have hypoglycemia and had gym right before this class). There were even days when he would bring snacks in for me from his cooking class he had before. 

We've both graduated now, have been since 2021, and are moving on with our lives. I have an 8 month old daughter and my fiance and I just recently moved into a new place. We had him over to help us move and he was playing with my daughter and trying to get me to take a nap saying he'll watch her. Looking back on this now makes me physically sick. 

We had him over again for a small housewarming party we did with close friends. This past Wednesday, while I was at my aunt and uncle's doing some laundry and grabbing more stuff that we still have over there from living with them, I got a call from my other friend. She told me I needed to sit down because this was going to destroy my friendship with him. 


Turns out, my best friend of 5 years has been sexually abusing his little sister for years. She's only 6 years old. Even as a young teen he would get kicked out of sleepovers with his friends because they'd catch him in the little sisters rooms trying to do stuff to them. He just turned 20 I think and his step sister called CPS on him about this because he stopped going to therapy for it. (his mother knew about it and put him in therapy for it, but once he turned 18 she could no longer schedule his appointments for some reason and I think he started up again. She also continually left him alone with her knowing this fact.) He got arrested but was released extremely quickly because there wasn't any ""proof"" of him doing things since there was no penetration involved. 

Now you might be wondering if this is all hearsay since I heard it from a friend and not from him. Well, once I got off the phone with my other friend I messaged him about it. The main response was ""I'm sorry you had to hear from a different source, but yes. I'm fucked up and I don't know why."" He admitted he was doing these things to little girls, one of whom was his little sister, and it seemed like he had no remorse. 

It's been super heavy on my mind since I found out because I have a daughter. He's been around her. I don't know what could've happened if I walked out of the room for 30 seconds to just use the bathroom. I trusted him. I didn't think he was capable of something like that. 

I feel like a horrible parent for letting someone like that around my child since I was SAd as a kid by a family member. I know there was no way for me to have known he did these vile things, but now that I know I can't get out of my head about him possibly hurting her if I wasn't as picky about leaving her alone. 

Something could've happened to my daughter and I feel like it could've been my fault if it did. 

I now am no contact with him. He's going to be paying my fiance back the little bit of cash he gave him to get a renewed ID then we will never speak to him again. I hate him. I hate this person that was hidden from me. There was no way I could've known, but I still feel like absolute garbage for letting him near my kid.

2022-11-14 03:30:24,27,True,5,"Yep. I was using my mom's bathroom to take a shower because my little sister was using the main one.
I turn around to get the shampoo that's behind me, and on my right I see this small pink thing that looks like chapstick. Exact same size as a usual one. It's a bit heavy, so I'm thinking ""that's odd, chapstick is never this heavy."" And as I'm looking at it, I see it has a small black button. Out of curiosity, I pressed it. And this little thing has a strong vibration.

I finish up, scrub my hand, and tell my sister about it. Her reaction was a wide mouth and quiet ""she has one?"" I go show her, and she just goes ""Bro if that were me I would kms.""

My mother used the bathroom before I went in, and probably forgot about it or something. But god I feel gross now

2022-11-14 03:48:18,0,True,2,"I volunteer for my university's theatre department as a calling stage manager. This position is often stressful and have little to no thanks. I just closed a fantastic production of Dave Malloy's *Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812*. As I'm scrolling through Facebook looking for posts in theatre groups I come across creative team members and cast members posts about the show. In damn near all of them they list the creative team and always leave the stage manager (and two assistants) off. Even [broadwayworld.com](https://broadwayworld.com) did this too. I am so frustrated with this! Myself and my two assistants spent so much more time and energy into this production than the entire cast, as well as some of the creative time. In fact, I have worked with some of this cast and creative team on more than 1 show and they have left me off their posts. Why? It's such BS.

2022-12-21 22:32:09,4,True,0,"Tl,dr; I was staying at a friends house because he is dropping me off at the airport tomorrow. He had to leave the house to cover a shift for his friend. I got curious and decided to snoop around. I found his diary in his study and read it. It's only from the start of this month. In it he wrote about his relationship troubles and how he feels hopeless. I'm really concerned about him and don't know how to bring this up without telling him I snooped. 

Sorry for formatting and spelling I'm on my phone so I'm not too sure how this will turn on a computer. 

So I'm flying back home for Christmas tomorrow and I asked my friend, who I'll refer to as A, if I could stay at his house for the night and of be could drop me off at the hotel in the morning.  He said sure as he's of now till the new year and would be happy to help. I got to his and we spent most of the day together until a few hours ago. He got a call from one of his friends who manages a shop saying that a few people called in sick and he asked if A could come in and help for a few hours until the store closed. A agreed and told me what happened and that he'd be back in a few hours. He gave a joke speech about how he was trusting me with the house and that I shouldn't throw any parties or invite any boys over and he left. 

After about 2 hours I got bored of watching tv and decided to look around his house. I know I shouldn't have and this was a huge invasion of his privacy but I couldn't help myself. The last time I saw A was 3 months ago and I've rarely been to his house.
I ended up inside his study and saw a couple of books on the bookshelf and a book that was lying flat above them caught my eye. It didn't have a name on the back and it had a plain grey cover. It piqued my curiosity so I opened it and saw that it was a diary for this month.

Now I know I should've put it down and left the room. But A never struck me as the person who would use a diary, far from it. So I started reading from the start of the month and how he feels makes me worried for him. At the start of the month he had a date with a girl from tinder but was stood up and he got worse from there. There were days where he wrote about how worthless he felt and how insignificant he was. He wrote about potentially commuting suicide but he went on to write how that was selfish. The main line that really hurt me when I read it was ""No matter what I do, what success I achieve at work or in my hobbies it's all ultimately meaningless. I come back to a dark and empty house with nothing but myself"". 

A has never been like this around me or my other friends. He's always been the protector of the group so to speak. He plans a lot of out get togethers and has been there for us all. He was there when my Fiancè cheated on me and I was breaking down. He offered to pay for another one of our friends surgery when his insurance got denied. He's thoughtful, kind, strong I can't believe he feels this way about himself. I'm really concerned about him and I don't know  how to bring this up because I know if I do ask him he all brush it off and act like nothing us happening .

i started going out with my bf about a year ago. this is my first real relationship that i have had, and his first as well.  i haa had a crush on him for a while and apparently he did with me as well. we started going out and everything was peachy for the first couple months. we would hang out as much as possible and i enjoyed it.

he is a genuinely caring person, i feel. he brings me coffee and lunch when i cant make it accross campus (im disabled with a really busy schedule, so thats really nice). he invites me places and we usually have a good time! he helped me make my first dnd character, and i really enjoy the game that we are in! i will admit some hesitation to addressing things with him is because of this game. im really attatched to my character. if i broke up with him i would probably have to leave (his brother is the dm).

however, theres some things that im not sure about. one thing is that he has an explosive temper and gets angry at small things all the time. i end up feeling guilty about things or trying to calm him down and i dont like that. i asked someone about it and they said it was fine, we have to accept things about our partners sometimes, but i really dont know if thats good.

we have been arguing a lot lately too, but only about small things. i was driving him to the theater the other day and i commented on a beatles song and said some memey stuff about the beatles (""they suck"") (i dont actually think that). and he just got annoyed with me and made it about how i never like anything he likes and am ""contrary.""

this is more worrying, but i dont know much about men, so bear with me. he is also very horny. i am not, and never really have been. i enjoy sex, but i am only in the mood occasionally (maybe once or twice a month). he gets pouty when i dont have sex with him, and manages to make everything very sexual, and insists that every interaction we have is a little sexual for him.

there have been a couple times where i have woke up with him either grinding on me or just rubbing his dick on me. i think he knows i am alseep when he does it. both times i have woken up to it i have pretended to be sleep, mostly just to see what hell do. thats always been the extent of it, i end up falling about to sleep. i dont know if thats normal or not. any thoughts, men?

then there is a lot of comments that make me hesitate doing things. he says im the best thing that happened to him, that im the leading source of happiness in his life, etc. then he buys me, like a lot of stuff. the dnd players handbook, fancy hairclips, etc.

We had our ups and downs but were basically happy until recently were we hit a low point and I got told what happened in her holiday in August.

A little Background information which I think is relevant: Gf was abused in the past before we have known each other. I have always been supportive in helping her with her trauma, talking with her and also taking her and paying for therapy. 

Now: We had a large argument about the relationship in general, I was going through a rough patch (had to stop my studied due to health and also my aunt died recently). According to her the love „faded away“ by me beeing kinda absent and depressed myself which I totally get. This argument happened in the beginning of January where we then told each other to take some tile for ourselves and think this relationship through.
Today we talked about it and both wanted to try it again, taking things slowly and working on our problems. Everything was going good until she started to cry. I asked what was wrong and she told me „Im sorry that I didnt tell you this before“.

Honestly I thought she cheated or something, but I kept calm and told her to calm down, take a breath and tell me.
She told me the following:
While she was on Vacation (in August 2021) with her family she went to a show the hotel hosted. After the show she went to the bar to get a specific non-alcoholic cocktail. Apparently the bartender noticed how much she liked it and offered her to show her what juices he used in the storage room. At first she was resistant, then she gave in thinking what could go wrong.
She then went with him to the storage room where he pushed her back and kicked her handbag away. He then proceeded to grope her and let her go. She didnt want to talk more about it and I obviously didn’t force her and calmed her down.

Now that shes gone im thinking this through again and I really feel bad for my thoughts but I cannot help it.
Im thinking that why would she even go with him? Even if he was pressuring her into going, for me that would be another reason just not to.I dont give her the fault for being groped don’t understand me wrong, but rather Im thinking why she would go with him in the first place.
I asked her why she didn’t tell me before and she told me she was ashamed which i totally understand and support. 

I really don’t know how to handle the situation and feel bad for even loosing some trust, but here I am. 
I really sound like an asshole here and im really trying to make sense of this but Im totally confused of what to think/do.
I am glad to give her a chance and support here but I cannot help to think why go there.

   I remember reading a comic book by a person who’s pen name was John Doe. It was an online comic about his real childhood story- he and his two friends got pulled over because they had drugs in their car. When the police asked them separately who put the drugs there, they all said themselves and the other people had nothing to do with it.   


   John Doe’s parents found out and sent him to a “rehab” camp for bad kids. He was kidnapped in the middle of the night, thrown on a car, and was driven to a faraway place in the middle of the woods where the camp was. The camp was run on an abusive policy where kids weren’t allowed to speak, show emotions, or go outside unless instructed to do so. Whenever someone did something the ”mentors” did not like, that someone would get yelled at by every single kid in the camp.   


   Eventually, John Doe couldn’t take it and escaped. He was escaped for only a short amount of time before he was tracked down and thrown back in camp.

   I can’t remember anything after that. It was a good look into how the world still works because John Doe was in America and I was so shocked to find out camps like that still exist.

Final edit: again, thank you guys for the kind words and awards! I want to make a final clarification which I can see would be misconstrued by the wording in my post. I don’t shun porn nor have I cut it from my life. What I mean is porn is significantly less satisfying to me than my partner. My partner doesn’t care if I look at porn nor do I care if they do but to me, my partner is so attractive that outside porn sources aren’t really needed anymore for me to get off.",TrueOffMyChest,Porn is useless to me now.,1429.5,2022-02-13
2022-02-14 02:06:19,4,True,3,"I've always wondered why arousal dictates so much about the experience of ejaculation. I can only speak for men because I am one, but I cum more and it shoots farther the more aroused I am, and the orgasm is more pleasurable. 

From an evolutionary perspective, why does mental stimulation have such a profound effect on what is primarily a biological function? If a cave man had sex with both a woman with boobs big enough to get him aroused, and a woman with the biggest boobs he'd ever seen and he reached peak arousal, he'd cum more with the latter than the former. I would assume more sperm is released as well, although I could be completely wrong about that.

What is the evolutionary benefit to him cumming more, and enjoying the sex more, with the bigger-breasted woman? From a biological perspective, the only function of sex is to procreate. That can be achieved with any woman, as long as the man is aroused enough to ejaculate. Why should there really be any measurable difference between the quality of sex with one person versus any other? 

I could just be reading too much into it, but I was under the impression that our bodies were molded by thousands of years worth of evolution, and that with certain exceptions (appendix), everything our body does is because we need it to do that, and everything we're capable of is because we need to be capable of it.  I'm just having a hard time imagining why we *need* to enjoy sex more and produce more semen when we're having it with Scarlett Johansson than we do with Amy Schumer.",NoStupidQuestions,"Why does level of arousal affect intensity of orgasm, amount of ejaculate, or force with which it comes out?

2022-03-08 07:03:28,2,True,1,"Tldr, my girlfriend relies heavily on me and if we were to break up she wouldn't exactly make it in life, I would feel guilty.


So as the title says I (25 m) feel stuck with my girlfriend (22 f). we have been dating for 2 And a half years, started in one city she moved across country to help her family member and we either had to decide whether we break up or I move with her, I love her so much so I decided to move with her. Like many couples we have our ups and downs but mainly it's just ups, But as for the downs they are... well, different. 

She doesn't work so I'm the one who provides income for the most part having basically 2 jobs. Her aunt pays her for assisting her and it isn't too much, she doesn't really get a job because;
 1. She's not that strong, she is shorter than 5ft and can barely lift 15lbs. 
2. She can't read very well anything that involves reading I help her out. 
3. She is horrible at basic math so counting money is out of the question. So that leaves out a lot of opportunities for jobs for her. 

Another problem is general living together, she does cook time to time and do most household duties but she expects me to do as much as her. Dont get me wrong I have no problem doing my part in chores and stuff but after working most of the time I'm just too exhausted and want to relax from time to time, but still rarely have time for myself. Most of it is spent with her cause I want her to be happy and feel loved and I really do love her.

Also she has trust issues big time she thinks that at any point I will cheat on her or that I'm talking/flirting to other girls and that I can't just have a civil talk with them and That all men most likely cheat.

Final problem is the sex life, that is if there is one. we never had sex yet, matter a fact she is still a virgin and she is scared that once we have sex I will just leave her and i understand that so im patient waiting for her to be ready. She does give me a hand job every now and then but that's about it, no oral cause it hurts her mouth.

I love her with all my heart but I don't think I can handle the mental gymnastics or the stress. We did plan to move back across the country to my family and for a better job for me but I still think things will be the same as now. And for the part where I'm stuck she relies heavily on me for her well being if break up she will be stuck with her aunt which just uses her and so she would have to settle for a guy that may not be understanding of her situation and I don't want her to be left alone like that I would feel it would be my fault or I just let her go for my well being and guilty for it.  she is a nice girl and she deserves a good guy bit I don't think that guy is me.

I know this story may seem confusing and I'm not sure I worded it well but if anything else I just needed to get these thoughts off my chest and hear what others think of this situation. Will be glad to answer any questions.",relationship_advice,feeling stuck with my girlfriend,1.5,2022-03-08
2022-03-27 08:46:10,1,True,2,"I (33F) have been with my partner (32 afab non-binary they/them) for 10 months. When I first met them, it was different from any other first date I’d ever been on. It’s like I’d known them my whole life and conversation came so easy. Things have been great in our relationship up until September last year. That’s when I began noticing a change. Nothing major had happened other than them going on detachment for 3 weeks. They are in the military.

We have been through 3 detachments already and that one was particularly hard. We had gotten into arguments while they were gone. After they came back it’s like a switch had flipped. Barely talking to me and no physical intimacy. I picked them up from base. The other 2 detachments, I was greeted with a long hug and kisses. This time I was just greeted with a hello. Normally they couldn’t wait to take off all my clothes and they didn’t have any desire at all. We would have sex every weekend we could considering we only see each other on weekends. 

Things seemed to get progressively worse from there. One of the many ways my partner initiates sex is by grabbing my ass, but they’ve begun this whole teasing thing where they do things they know turns me on but then they go to bed. I’ve mentioned on several occasions that in no way do I want them to feel pressured to have sex with me but at the same time I’d like it if they wouldn’t do things that they know turn me on if their intentions aren’t to have sex. This improved for a bit but has started again. 

We are now reaching a point where we are having sex 1-2 months at a time. It wouldn’t be so bad if there were other forms of physical intimacy to balance out the lack of sex. We don’t even cuddle anymore. They are literally so wrapped up in playing Pokémon Go and watching movies and shows on their phone it’s like I’m talking to a brick wall. Today, we were sitting on the bed and I was on my phone and they got mad at me saying I was ignoring them when I’ve tried to mention that they do the same to me all the time. 

We usually cook dinner together, this time they came into the kitchen and I did all the work while they retreated to my room and sat on the bed and watched TV. Then accused me of starting a fight because I was upset. They said “I’m not a ducking robot I’m not going to constantly do the same things over and over again”. But literally this is something consistent over 10 months that has suddenly changed. They usually text me good morning during the week because I am up later than them. They didn’t quite a few days. Also something that was consistent for 10 months.

2022-03-27 08:46:40,30,True,6,"I know what you're probably thinking, if I were r*ped, I would know... here's the situation. My bf (29) and me (28f) were staying the night at my parents apartment. They were in the process of moving to a house, so most of the furniture was gone. Bf and I slept on a mattress in the living room. He was starting to get frisky. I told him as much as I would love to, I'm uncomfortable because my mom and brother (22) were close by in their rooms and could walk out at any time. He persisted. My initial ""I'm uncomfortable(s)"" turned into begging and pleading for him to stop. He eventually stuck it in. Now my begging was through obvious tears he still claims he never noticed at first. I eventually got louder and more agressive in tone and attempted to shove him off of me. He finally stopped at that point. He went to sleep while I spent the next hour having a full fledged panic attack and then cried the rest of the night. Here's where the confusion lies. Despite feeling uncomfortable because of the circumstances, I am very much attracted to my boyfriend, I feel it may be insensitive to rape victims whose attackers are strangers or family members because that's much more terrifying. Also, I am afraid of confrontation and buckle under pressure, I could've and probably should have been more stern. There was a lot of ""baby I'm sorry but please, please stop"" and meek ""I don't want to do this"" granted I said them over and over...but still... I also didn't physically, hit, kick, scratch at him as I'm sure I would've if I feared for my safety or if a stranger assaulted me. Does being uncomfortable because of the location/potential complications of a sexual encounter qualify it as rape? Because if we had been alone I would have most definitely been down for it so that makes me question it. Lastly, all though I thought it would be a pretty obvious difference, he says he didn't know because in the past I've flirtatiously/playfully told him to stop and eventually gave in.

2022-04-23 01:44:40,5,True,27,"This series of fuck ups happened a good while ago but I put the last of the pieces together today, almost ten years later. It pushed me over the Rubicon I'd been meaning to cross for a while - to make a throwaway account and confess some of my sins. 

Starting university and coming from a sheltered background women were a complete mystery - I'd rarely spoken to girls my age 'till adulthood but by god I wanted to get over my shitty fear and throw myself out of my comfort zone. In a slightly (I'll admit) psychopathic mood on the first day of class I walked down the steps to the bottom of the lecture theatre, took a casual glance up at the hall, looked around in pretend confusion, and tried to spot someone attractive or friendly to sit with, and settled on sitting next to a girl who looked stunning. Might as well aim high, I thought. 

With some nervous chat, and more psychopathy from my end asking to borrow pens (which I had with me but kept hidden) and pencils (which I also had) we broke the ice and ended up becoming good friends. I started to fall deep into the abyss of overthinking absolutely everything. I found a great friendship group over the course of the freshman year, settled into life in the midwest, and at some point we discussed relationships, and she mentioned it would be 'pretty obvious' if she was into someone. 

Well great! That's a huge relief, I thought to myself. She'll just tell me if she's into me. She's not made any moves, we're all good. I don't need to risk anything! In my mind the question was settled. 

And so it began.

The one on one days out (well, friends DO that). The 'friendly' hand-holding (it wasn't weird at the time, but maybe?). The study sessions (well LOTS of people have study sessions), lunches, dinners, everything I pretty much dismissed. It all fell into that nebulous 'eh, well maybe it's just a different culture'. The dancing? Sure, maybe other folks have different personal boundaries and that sort of touching is okay, after all they're international students, right? Trying to sign me up for dance classes? Nah, she just wants to see me humiliate myself on the dance floor. She'd like to see my room? Nah, she just wants to laugh at the mess I complain I've got in there. She goes all the way to my dorms with me for some reason that (thinking back on it) makes no sense, and insists we see my room? Well, it may be quirky but it's nothing, surely. In my room I go 'welp, there you go! Now lets leave'. It sounds fucking ridiculous now, but it was spread out over months and months. 

Now this stuff went on for a good while and though the warning bells were there, in my mind they were the same warning instincts from high school saying 'be careful, this person may be a friend, but you don't know them that well. They might betray you, they might be toying with you'. I've had a bad case like many folks do of falling out with a friend, and that person using my secrets against me so I developed a pretty unhealthy vigilance about this sort of thing. 

And that's as much as I thought about it until I read a meme about 'missing hints' today, and I remembered that, oh yeah, there was that one time she got naked in public for a frat thing (that part I remember very clearly, go team delta kappa whatever) but I forgot until today about the part where she was insisting I, and only I, be the one to do the same. I refused point blank. Fuck that. Nah, she just wants to humiliate me, surely? And also didn't my friends keep asking me if I was into her? I forgot about that too but thinking back these people kept goddamn asking, I remember it getting annoying. Thinking it was a trap I kept telling my friends no, of course not, how could you think such unclean thoughts! The once or twice people had asked me this question in my teens had ended with them going to that person and telling them (yes, this includes my parents walking up to girls and telling them their son likes them). One fun time it become a school rumor I struggled to live down. There was one big difference I failed to realize - most people grow out of doing that shit. Sometimes they want to help you out. 

Let it be known by the council - I think I am big dumb. I'd be relieved if your comments said I'm not big dumb, but I doubt that'll be the outcome. In the spirit of the moment I genuinely thought 'she knows I like her and is trying to get us both naked to mess with me'. A small part of me still, bizzarely, feels that way, or that maybe it was a bit of both.  

For bonus points folks have said to me ""hey, I'm into your friend and want to get to know him better, but don't tell him I said that!"" and my default was ""ah yes, a secret to take with me to my grave. Rest assured, he shall never know,"" like some occult wizard. They've then asked me days later excited ""well, is he into me? Did you tell him?"" and I've had to say ""no, tell him yourself, I'm far too stupid for these mind games"".

I look ancient despite my age because I've been working multiple jobs since I was about 13, using my suicide attempts early on to the fullest I gained a lot of experience and lied until I could get my work permit so I could support my family. My current day is I wake up at 5am work at 6am until about 1pm come home for an hour head to my next job and on week ends I work at a pizza shop however when I get off of these jobs I come home and watch my mentally ill aunt (Paranoid schizophrenic) and grandmother (undiagnosed but age is seemingly getting to her on top of a difficult personality) basically deteriorate over time, I have had to help starting to bathe them for about 2 years now, I cook for them and me, I have to stop them from fighting physically and verbally and take care of things so they don't hurt each other. Despite that I've been successful with women. My dating life mainly began out of insecurity, I wanted to be able to please whomever I ended up with due to some traumatic happenings with my mother as she was a woman of the night and just frequent horror stories of how much people leave and cheat. I've been myself, I've faked being someone I wasn't and if I'm honest it all feels empty, maybe its just because I'm so fucking tired but between bouts of insomnia and my recent 5 year break up. Sometimes I leave my friends company and I pass out or have a small attack of some variety and come back like nothing has happened, i haven't been able to narrow down if its panic induced or anxiety induced. 

I stopped myself from being complacent because that isn't a good idea in general, but that made the relationship hell for me, I couldn't really relax and it tanked my self esteem ,stayed with someone who cheated on me and I knew it. She confessed, didn't cry or shout just gave her a monotone reply because I knew she did it to get a reaction out of me, that was about 2 years in things were ok but then she started getting obsessed with having friends, I supported her through that even though I was jealous and it came out a few times but not more than twice over our ENTIRE relationship. Made me feel like she was trying to replace me or that I wasn't good enough, I tricked myself into thinking her talks of marriage and kids were actually real. I stayed because well we literally spent every day together and she would just come over and we'd hang out all day (I know it sounds cringey and terrible) but because of how much of her time I was taking up it didn't seem like she was. 3 years go by and my family makes stupid choices and I have to work overtime, so I barely have time for her but I let her know if she needs anything at all to come to me. Over the years, I helped this girl sort out her feelings and issues, helped her with college (I didn't give her the answers but I forced her to get them herself), helped her meet new people and friends, tried to be the kinkiest I could be and fuck it sexually I pushed myself to never be satisfied with just once to keep her happy, but even that gets boring for people I understand.

Anyway because of my overtime I literally get home and I pass out, It was an unhealthy relationship because of me, I lied to her so she wouldn't worry and I had a fight with my family about telling her I got hospitalized due to heart issues. She kept sending me cute marriage and baby memes/pictures as I'm away but my responses kind of dry up, I should've done better, but as things start to look up I tell her about how I want to take her on a cruise that was coming up since covid restrictions lifted this summer, and on feb 1st, as I finally get free again, as soon as she see's me she dumps me over the phone and I have a break down. I know handling break ups can sometimes help the relationship stay afloat but after all the hard work I felt I put in I just can't stop crying, begging and I can't breathe. It hurt even more because I told her to get her mom after I tried to comfort her because I didn't want to hurt her with my uncontrolled reaction. She does and her mom tried but a lot of the things said hurt even worse especially since it was so fresh, she thanked me for helping her daughter be better but It made everything hurt so much more, how could like I apparently do all that but not be worth staying for. I hate that my post sounds like complaining because I accept that she probably used me and I'm sucking it up that all that matters is the fact that she doesn't want me. I left her alone immediately and on the 10th of febuary she messaged me for literally no reason after to our friends she called me, possessive, clingy, and hard to communicate with, even though she came over to MY house damn near every day for 5 years. I was upset still and told my 3rd lie of the relationship that I already got with someone else. This post is about why, because I'd rather she hate me and never hear about the fact that I took my own life. What's the fucking point of all of this effort and pain, the world isn't losing out on anything I literally add maybe .5% to the statistic, babies are born every single day. Surely one better than me in everyway will pop out so good riddance to me, hell it probably already happened. 

TLDR: Nothing is worth the pain I'm going through now, so I can watch my friends fucking die? So I can try and end up a shitty father and have both my kid and my hypothetTical wife just fucking leave me? So I can work my ass off in the gym to look literally half as a good as Danny Devito?

2022-05-05 04:49:28,26,True,31,"me and my gf have had this on an off relationship over the last 3 years. We’ve lived together majority of our relationship so there has rarely been much separation during these phases aside from me sometimes going to stay w some other family for a short time. 

During these times of us being not together though, i always try and have conversations to make sure that it’s clear about exactly what’s going on between us in regards to us being exclusive or not. she’ll reassure me that she’s not seeing anyone else but I get this gut feeling that she’s not being very honest bc of her history of lying . I created a bad habit I’m not proud of, where i go through her phone to see how honest she’s being with me. There hasn’t been a single time where she wasn’t lying to me. Whether it was harmless flirting or full on evidence that she had been having sexual encounters.

she always says I’m just being too sensitive or “that’s what i get for minding her business” 
I’ve even found texts of her mimicking me to friends about me being emotional about these experiences with her and that it’s my fault anyway.

Anyway fast forward to current day I’ve made the decision to go to the Navy. 

A few nights ago she went out, didn’t come back home and the next day she said she was at a a friends house and fell asleep. I didn’t trust her so i went through her phone and found texts of her asking her bff to cover for her and for condom recommendations and later in the thread explaining how her and some guy had fucked all night. When i confronted her she ofc got mad at me but then later swore on her mothers life that she didn’t have sex with anyone. I know this is dumb but i took her word bc i know how fond of her mother she is. 

Well i made the agreement with her that bc i have the money to, i could pay the rent in full or half for her so she didn’t have to worry about taking on the full expenses of the apt and not have to worry about being homeless when i leave and Also during the pandemic she 100% took care of all expenses between the two of us until i could get back on my feet. 
Even when i wasn’t financially stable for a while i always made sure i could do something for her for her bday and she never really has done the same but even still this year i was willing to do one last nice thing for her. I planned to book her and her sister a vacation. So i went on her Ipad that i got her for Valentines Day to book the trip but remembered I had took some pictures the other day and wanted to send them to myself to make a collage which i regularly do. Instead i found screenshots of her talking about pregnancy scares and being fucked raw and nutted in last summer, a time where she told me we were exclusive…. 
Even rn she’s out and told me she’d be home for us to get dinner and she didn’t even send me a courtesy text to not wait up.
I’m thinking of letting her know she needs to figure something out this month before i ship out next month.

Small update: i really appreciate you all being brutally honest w me and waking me up that i was tolerating such bs. I don’t have much family or friends so i guess i got kind of dependent. I think i need some therapy to heal from childhood traumas that even allowed me to withstand such treatment for so long! She’s on her way home now and I’m going to have a talk w her.

He introduced me to his friends and for a year things were great I felt accepted for the first time.

On the night it happened it was a house party I was happy and having fun and drank too much, the night was coming to a close so I was in the garden sitting down on one of the chairs having a smoke to sober up and Ryan's best friend sat down next to me.

We were chatting about the evening and what had happened but he kept saying sexual things like how I had a fling with a girl kept asking how he wished he could have a threesome. He started touching my leg and moving further up and the only thing my stupid brain could think to do was to pretend to be asleep so that he would stop. He started touching himself I heard the noise of his tracksuit bottoms and I opened my eyes a crack to see what he was doing I felt frozen i couldn't move I couldn't think I couldn't open my stupid mouth.

My boyfriend came out after a few minutes and sat down, he joked with his mate that I was asleep I felt frozen how can I tell him that his friend had just done this? How the hell can this guy act so normal how can he hide it? Would he take my side? Would be believe me? 

My boyfriend called a taxi and this friend came with us, he kept touching my upper leg in the taxi so I kept pretending to sleep but he wouldn't stop, my boyfriend was right next to me I was wedged in the middle. I felt so disgusted with myself for not screaming, shouting or doing anything I just froze. I don't know why I couldn't move I feel so much regret and shame why couldn't I just say something. 

The self loathing never stopped I still feel it now. I broke up with my boyfriend after a month of it happening because I felt like if I told him he would see it as cheating because I didn't speak up. I feel ashamed. I never wear skirts or shorts now because of it just so that they can't touch me there.

So I work at an elementary school, and the people who work in my office are very cool. One of the secretaries and I have had a prank thing where we like to scare each other with loud noises. It’s just an ongoing funny thing we do. Usually we just yell each  other’s name, or maybe we yell “good morning”  or something, and try to get the person to jump. 

Recently I was in a dollar store and I saw  these party airhorns. They were only two dollars, and they were very very small.  I really didn’t think that they could even be that loud. I mean I’ve actually heard the type used on a boat and I know  those are insane, but this was like 1/3 of the size of one of those. So I bought one. 

So it’s the last day of school, I’m full of energy, and I run down to the office. My coworker and a group of teachers are all sitting around and I point the air horn towards my coworker and then it goes off, incredibly loud, hurting everyone’s ears. Honestly, it was like 10 times louder than I expected it to be. 

People are now  visibly upset at me, like really upset, asking me what the hell was I thinking, some people look like they’re about to cry. One person kind of yelled at me and stormed off. 

When the office clears out it is then I find out that there has just been a medical emergency. One of the staff people had actually been bleeding on to the floor, and  been picked up by ambulance. The coworker I share the pranking with told me the staff person might’ve actually just had a miscarriage.

Usually I know what’s going on at the school, especially if there’s an emergency. But I had just been on an important call in a different section of the school, so I had  no idea. I apologized profusely, but nobody wanted to hear it.

I f(22) started seeing this guy m (23) almost a month ago and things have been almost too good to be true, we met on tinder which is ew but whatever modern dating is what it is, we talk all day everyday and FaceTime most nights out of the week and all of our dates have been great. Last night I went over to his house for the first time and I ended up meeting his parents, I brought flowers and alcohol for them as a way of saying thank you for letting me come over which went over really well. His parents are really sweet and accepting, his mom invited me to come back and said we’d cook together and watch some shows we both like. 

The thing that has me feeling really weird about everything is that we ended sleeping together for the first time and the whole thing was awful. We agreed to use a condom which he had absolutely no problem with butas it turns out part way through he took off the condom without telling me and after finding out I freaked out and he basically said that there wasn’t much we could do about it and that he was sorry and then went on to say that when he disappoints or upsets people it makes him anxious and upset but he didn’t really validate my feelings.

I was introduced to all his close friends. One particular female bff had me a little iffy. They always said that they weren't each others types.

However, recently while about to answer my aunt calling his phone. For starters we were both off from work and he was tired from work, he was taking a nap. We were cuddling and i happened to notice a peculiar feeling seeing him message his fbff. I was uncomfortable about their flirting with one another. They didnt do it in front of me. Which i wouldn't have minded or cared because i did that sort of talk with my own bff cause we knew each other since 2008. Shes my fbff. Yes we had sexual relations at one point of our friendship but we knew we didnt belong together so stayed friends. I never kept that from my partner tho.

Moving on, during one drunk escapade, it was my bf, me and our shared buddy (we'll call him A). My bf was sharing a personal story, and happened to mention he had a thing for candace when he was younger, about 17/18. We'll that shocked me because he said he never had feelings for her like that ever. I stayed quiet about it, and they still talked but in front of me it was just friendly. I dont know how they've talked on the days im not with him and our kids. In the messages between them its scarce( almost feels like things were deleted). But he calls her babygirl and says i loves and misses her. And she says she loves and misses him too. I'm a little numb and really upset like im a bout to snap but im also dominated by numbness. Was our whole relationship a lie? I had caught him cheating before but with a different friend i didnt even know about who happened to be his ex. Im not sure i can talk things through if i confront him now. 

For reasons, after the first time he cheated i got petty and sent flirty texts to my ex. But i never deleted them or did anything different to show i was hiding them. I WANTED him to find them so he'd know how i felt. My ex knew the plan and still played along because he said we're friends and id help you with anything. When he asked why i did it i told him there wasnt any feelings i was just trying to get money he owed me back. I said i dont see how he could be upset when he had been sending vulgar things to an ex himself especially a topless pic she sent him. And he had said there wasnt feelings he was just worried about the exes daughter and didnt know any other way to keep an eye on her. (Least i only sent texts.) Still i knew what i did was wrong and we had a talk and apologized and we settled things together and ended with a hot, steamy shower before bed.

But we are different in some behavioral stuff, and the anxiety of, shit, though we essentially the same, and share the same values of life, we are different, and it just hits me.

Like, for example, I like to swear a lot. And I want to do it in front of her, if I stumble on some bad situation. But I can't do this, because she doesn't appreciate that.

Then it restricts my freedom and I just shove this frustration down, which you can't do, because this eventually will build up and then you have an argument or whatever, in the future. The only thing I can think of, resolvement-wise, is having sex with her like an animal, and she really likes that.

Sometimes, she will turn away from me trying to kiss her, I get frustrated of course, but she's just teasing like that, and when I turn away myself, she'll lean in and kiss me passionately (like, double of what I wanted to do). So she provokes me to have a passionate, animal-like, rough sex.

It's very hot, but it has some problems in it. I feel, the only reason to stay and endure our differences, is always touch each other (she likes that as well, very much) and have furious sex, like, every day. But it doesn't rhyme with my life. With stuff that I see in life on a daily basis. With my world view. But man, I would have lied if I said that it didn't calm me down in a way, I really love being with her because of that reason - my body is as calm as it could get. It's my mind, that's where I see the trouble.

Constant anxieties, feeling not myself, feeling, I'm losing myself. Doesn't help that she wants to have a baby, but I'm not ready for it, ALTHOUGH, I can't imagine having sex with her with a condom.  I mean, we tried it from time to time, on her fertility days, but it feels so unnatural it just brings everything down.

But also it feels like, with that sex I'm kinda punishing her, take revenge, one-up her for our differences, for how I can't express myself to her. But I just can't help not agreeing with her most of the times. So the sex is the only weapon I have against her.

Does anyone know what might be going on here? I'm confused. I love how my body feels around her, but my mind is just in a constant anxiety mode. No, with her it's fine, it's when she leaves doing her own thing, that's when the reality kicks in, and I resort to my, living-alone-on-this-planet habits. Love and patience just doesn't mix well with my world view?.. I don't know.

She says, we should live together, it's because I live alone, that's why that happens to me. But I don't want to be babytrapped with a person I'm not sure about. I don't know

**Tl:dr:** My body and mind feels great with her, but without her around, I resort to my loner habits and those two lifestyles just don't match and I have anxieties on the level of, why am I on this planet, and I feel I'm losing myself and I'm with a wrong person, because to me, in a healthy relationship, you should be ok with being alone, and the relationship would be just a nice extra

**Edit:** Sometimes I wish I could just use tinder, to see what other possibilities are... but I don't allow myself to use those, because I'm faithful to my girlfriend

The closest thing that helps me a lot is talking to my therapist about it, or here on Reddit, because man, sometimes I think (and thought actually, as I has gradually pulled myself into this mess) this relationship, as much as it helped me (it really did) feel myself more, destroyes me also.

So, i’ve been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts these past 3 years for many different reasons. However, 2 weeks ago, i’ve chosen that I no longer wanted to live the way that I was. That I wanted to heal and learn to love my body again. I’ve started to journal and meditate every day and it’s been really helping me. I’ve been really proud for taking the initiative to help myself since I came to the realization that no one was going to help me other than myself.

And yesterday, I had this crazy idea of revealing past traumas to my mom.  I thought it’d be a good thing to get things off my chest. 

I told her that I had gotten sexually assaulted while we were on vacation. That he forcefully penetrated my rect** while I begged him not to and for him to stop multiple times. I also told her about this memory of us at the airport. How I still remember her trying to wipe food off my cheek and how I got startled since he had bitten my cheek a few times. I told her how I got slut shamed for some other situation and other things. (I only ended up telling 1/4 of what i wanted to tell her)

Finally, after throwing a few “ohs”, “aha” and “okays”, my mom told me that it was in the past and that I should learn from it. That I should learn to have brought respect for my body so that I don’t easily give myself again. That we all get a slut phase, but that I should learn from it. That I’m lucky that it wasn’t as bad as other girls. That it could’ve been worse. That I should move on from it (which she isn’t wrong about) and that I should see the bigger picture. 

I tried defending myself, but it was pretty useless since she continue babbling about life lessons. 

Eventually, she got tired of scrolling down her instagram and changed the conversation to absolutely useless things. She started to realize how little I was engaged to our conversation, so she tried to fill the silence with more anecdotes of I don’t know what.

I was completely disconnected at that point. She finally told me that “I can always share to her and that she wouldn’t judge me” before going to bed. I then went out for a very long walk to try to stay calm, but I couldn’t help myself from crying.

I didn’t ask for advice. Nor did I ask for life fucking lessons. All I wanted was for her to hear me out. To reassure me. To tell me that she loves me and that it wasn’t my fault. 

It was so hard for me to share this to her. But, I should’ve known better since every single time I tell her anything concerning my mental health, she tells me that i’m overly dramatic.

I just don’t know where to go from here. I’m having a really hard time letting this one go. I usually always find away to excuse my moms behaviour, but i’m finding it really hard to move past this one. 

She realized I was cold today. She even asked if I was mad. I told her that i’ll be fine by tomorrow hopefully. Then she asked if I was mad at her and I just told her that it was going to be okay.

Should I tell her how I really feel? I am scared that i’ll make a fool out of myself just like every other time. And to be quite honest, i’d rather limit my interactions with her from now on.",TrueOffMyChest,I finally told my mom about my sexual assault after 2 years and here was her reaction.,44.5,2022-07-04
2022-07-08 02:35:09,8,True,2,"So to put you guys in context. She and I met 6 years ago in high school. We became very close friends and 2 years later we became a couple. We were going to be 4 years into our relationship in November this year, but about 6 weeks ago I got really mad at her because we were having a casual chat conversation and it came to the topic that she met a guy from another country through Omegle in December 2021. She told me they talked about irrelevant topics and exchanged instagram users. And that since then they have only had conversations from time to time and that they both mentioned that they have partners and that he even told her about his girlfriend. Honestly the only thing that bothered me was the fact that I found out 6 months later, as I thought it would be something you would have to tell your partner. By the way, we both still live with our parents, so a lot of our conversation happens through text messages or video calls.

***I also have to mention that I have anxiety/panic attacks, paranoia and compulsive anger disorder, among other possible as yet undiagnosed mental issues. Therefore our relationship has been very marked by times when I overreact to small problems, lose my temper and end up insulting her because something may happen that makes me think she did something disrespectful to our relationship, or a man may have said something offensive to her and I want to defend her, etc. She has made the decision to break up with me on a couple of occasions in the past, as she has always insisted that I need therapy and professional help as the last time I went to therapy I was about 12 years old. I am aware of that but never had the courage to take that big step. On those occasions I always appeal to dialogue with her to get her to reconsider her decision.***

**Going back to what happened 6 weeks ago**: after getting angry with her and arguing, things were a bit cold between us. She was trying to talk to me like nothing happened but I couldn't treat her like nothing happened, I can't stand ignoring issues. So she decided to ignore me because of that. The next night she went out to a church event in the neighborhood where she lived a few years ago. I had no idea it was a church event as I only saw the pictures she posted on instagram. I freaked out and started texting her saying things that I have to admit, were a little offensive. We were arguing and then she told me that the best thing is that we should break up. After that day the next few days I spent trying to convince her that it's best if we talk before making such a big decision but she refused. We are really close and we are used to tell each other how our days are going and go out every weekend since I have a job in addition to college. But after that everything felt very empty. 

After another couple of days she tells me via text message that she is going to an event at a nightclub with some friends from her class. This event was from a university organization of her faculty. But she didn't even support that organization. I asked her directly why she would go to that event since she doesn't even support them and doesn't like nightclubs and **her response was: we were invited**. That made me so upset and I had a severe anxiety attack. I got so angry, I started calling her, texting her, but she ignored me. I only caught a glimpse of a story on her instagram account but I didn't know which club it was. After a couple of hours her mom sends me a message asking for my ex girlfriend since it was late at night. Talking to my mother in law I found out that my ex girlfriend told her it was an event AT HER UNIVERSITY. She didn't tell her that the event was at a night club, so I told the mom that the event was at a club and my ex found out I told her mom and then hshe blocked me from everywhere because of it.

I was so desperate that the next day I went to her college to talk to her. She ignored me so I waited for her classes to finish and tried to talk to her but she refused and continued on her way home with a classmate of hers. There was a point in the ride where she got off the bus, I followed her, and she told me to go to the nearest mall to talk. Apparently she wrote to my mother telling her the situation and asking her to pick me up. I fell into the trap. But my ex told me she would come to my house the next day to talk.

The next day we talked, she told me how she felt so hurt by me that she could no longer be my partner. I told her that I finally understood the gravity of my situation and finally made the decision to go to therapy. But she insisted that it was too late. I felt devastated. I had never heard her so determined to break up with me. She cried, and told me that in spite of everything I was very important to her and that she wanted to see me get better.

After that we kept in touch but no longer as a couple. I felt very uncomfortable because I still see her as my partner. Until a couple of days after talking at my house I see that she uploads a couple of pictures of her on her instagram. I write to her asking her how she could upload pictures as if nothing, if a couple of days ago she told me that she felt devastated and sad just like me. That had me baffled. She got mad at me for asking her that question and ended up blocking me from everywhere. 

Since then I started therapy. A couple of weeks ago I convinced her to meet me to talk. She agreed. I told her how I was feeling about it, how I had depression, suicidal thoughts. But she just said that she was comfortable with us not being a couple. And that she couldn't see me as a couple anymore. In the end our conversation that day ended simply with goodbye.

I still feel enormously devastated and very sad. I was diagnosed with depression. Every day I think about hurting myself. 

I have discovered that she goes out with her friends as if nothing has happened. It hurts me a lot that she is involved in a big political project (a project that I encouraged her to join) that I will no longer be a part of, and that in general, she goes on with her life as if nothing has happened and therefore I will not be part of those good and bad moments of life. We have chatted on a couple of occasions. I tell her how I feel but she says nothing will change her mind. Which hurts me because she stresses that she still cares about me, but I don't feel that way. I think she just doesn't want the burden of feeling like if something happens to me, it was her fault.

**TL;DR:** Grief+Stress = low sex drive. Boyfriend is upset about it and struggles to communicate, which makes me want to have sex even less.
____

My boyfriend and I have been together for 5+ years. Our relationship started off as purely sexual before we fell in love and built a life together.

Unfortunately, my sex drive has just gone over the last couple years, and I feel like he’s not communicating about it in the most healthy or effective way… which just makes my sex drive lower.

We haven’t had sex in a few weeks, and I know he wanted to last night: I told him I wasn’t in the right headspace, and he immediately respected that, which I’m so grateful for. (If I’m being honest, there have been multiple times where I felt really pressured to give in and have sex, just because he would get really upset, frustrated, and hurt if we didn’t.)

I stayed up all night deep cleaning, doing laundry, vacuuming, writing, and crying - I eventually went to bed around 5 am. This morning, he spilled coffee grounds over a surface I cleaned last night and got really angry and frustrated (Shaking his fists, saying “Fuck!”, tossing things aside.) He was angry I wasn’t getting out of bed, since we need to run errands before he goes to work today. I made a calm joke saying, “it’s okay - don’t cry over spilled coffee.” Which he didn’t appreciate, he told me to shut up, and that he didn’t want to hear it.

I asked if he’d like to talk about what was really going on, since he was far too angry for it to just be about the coffee, and he said he didn’t want to talk about it, that it wasn’t an appropriate time. We moved in with my mother last year, and he said he didn’t want to talk about what was bothering him while she was in the other room, and he really didn’t want to talk about it now while I have so much going on in my life.

That’s when I knew his frustration was about our lack of sex, and it feels like that outburst almost negates how kind he was to drop it last night.

I think I know why my sex drive has been gone:

I’ve dealt with a lot of loss over the last two years: my father died suddenly in Nov 2020 (which is why we moved in with my mom: to help her with the bills while I take care of the estate), and my “Other-Father” as I called him passed away a week ago. 

Other-Father was my dads best friend: he helped raise me, taught me to throw a football, supported me as a close friend and confidant my whole life. After my father passed, he and I would talk on the phone every week. Losing him has been a huge gut punch, especially since I’m one of his only “family members.” He didn’t have kids, or a partner. I was his daughter, and I loved him so, so much.

When I’m thinking about my dead fathers nonstop, sex and horniness is just repulsive to me.

On top of that, my job is incredibly stressful, I have two estates to handle now, and I’m uncomfortable with how much of the mental load I have to take on at home with the chores. I spent all yesterday ironing his clothes, doing all of the laundry, matching dozens of pairs of his socks, cleaning up his exercise equipment, and it felt like a slap in the face when he lashed out at me this morning.

I know if he approached me and asked how I was doing, and what he could do to support me, and had a gentle conversation about our sex life, I would be feeling much better about things. But he doesn’t like talking about his feelings, I had to really push to get him to say that his anger wasn’t just about the coffee this morning. 

I love him so much, and I just don’t know what to do. I know we need a relationship counselor, but I wanted to get some input here first.",relationship_advice,My (29 F) boyfriend (28 M) is upset by my low sex drive.,8.5,2022-07-17

In 2015 I (25f) took my first full time job as a trainee teacher assistant at my local school. I was 18 years old, and was simply there to help out students with additional needs. I was being paid $10 AUD per hour. A few weeks into the school year, I had to go on camp with a few classes of 12-13 year olds. We went and camped at a local beach. 

A day or so into the trip, I see the students acting suspicious, like they are hiding something. I find out that they have found a native bush rat (which are really sweet, clean, cute Australian marsupials). They had terrorised this sweet baby to the point where it was in shock, and they had poured a sugary syrup of some sort over its entire body. 

I immediately told the the camp staff and the teachers I was on this trip with. They made the students release the marsupial back into the bush, and there were no repercussions, much to my pleading. We have local wildlife rescue centres and they were not interested in contacting them. I was not allowed to do so myself as I was on the clock and had other duties. I was told not to intervene further. 

I was upset. A few hours later I secretly went to check the area that the animal was released it. I found it in the same exact spot. It was labouring. It was very clearly slowly dying. And thanks to the students, ants were crawling all over and began to eat parts of its face. I couldn’t bear it. I burst into tears but knew what I had to do. I put the beautiful creature out of its misery as quickly as I could. 

I never told anybody what I did. I still think about this regularly and how things could and should have gone differently. I love animals, and never even kill insects. I’m crying typing this. I just want to forget.",TrueOffMyChest,I will never forgive those kids,6.0,2022-07-17

He pressured me into sex 2 months in, when I was 14. He ended up SA-ing me in the bathroom of a party in 2020. I was routinely having sex with him, even when I was a minor and he was legally an adult. About 8 months in, the arguments and abuse started. I was putting in so much effort to keep him around but he didn't even want to try to make it work. During December of 2021, I finally broke it off. I was in so much pain and strife that month. But he tried to win me back. He danced me around in the rain and made love to me instead of having sex with me. After 2 weeks I caved and got back together with him. The same cycle of abuse started and my mom found out about the SA, so I was forced to break it off with him. I started talking to him and I had sex with him again about 2 weeks after that incident, but I had to leave again when one of my friends started to threaten leaking information about him on the internet.

My other classmates saw the commotion and I begged them to just call the teacher. They all laughed. Even my other so called friend called the kid my boyfriend and we would make a perfect couple. I don't even know why I was friends with her from begining, she was sick in head if she thought that was good thing to say. I begin to lost consciousness and that mf came up to me and said ""I guess you were not the strong girl after all, you couldn't even fight the kid."" That words hunt me to this day. I thought that was it, I'm going to die. I remember laying on floor, I never felt so weak in my life. I looked and saw teacher slaping the kid to move away from me. My friend who called the teacher came up to me but that is all blur to me. I remember locking myself in school bathroom. When I came back to hall, my so called friend made another joke when I will make out with my boyfriend which I called her disgusting and sick for thinking that. She got hurt by that but I didn't care. I never blamed a kid bc what I knew about him he is good kid and I would never want to hurt a kid. Even if I tried to fight back I would be in trouble for harming a kid. I constantly have nightmares about this and when ever I tried to talk with anyone, everyone is saying ""You got attacked by kid with disabilty. That's so funny"" or just laugh it off. What traumatised me the most is that my classmates who I thought I was close with laughed at me while I was screaming and begging the for help. I always had nightmares about what if teacher didn't come in time and my last memories would be people laughing at my body.

Me (19M) and Abby (Fake Name 19F) started dating our junior year of highschool, I always enjoyed the time we spent together and I really love spending time with her now. We just click. We'd hangout at each other's houses and I got along great with her family, as did she with mine. At the end of our Junior year, she asked me out. While I was a bit apprehensive about saying yes, I agreed but told her upfront that I was attracted to big girls which she definitely isn't a big girl. We both agreed this wouldn't be a problem. As we both love spending time with each and both have similar goals. We both wanna have a family, we both wanna live peaceful lives. 

Fast forward and both of us are in college now. At many points in our relationship, we've been sexual and while I love foreplay, making out, eating her out, and doing certain kinky bedroom things when it comes to intercourse I simply can not perform. I am not attracted to her in that manner, I wish I was, and she obviously wishes I was but it just doesn't happen. I like my girls with a big soft tummy, jiggly thighs, stretch marks, and love handles. God, I love me some big girls but Abby just isn't a big girl.. 

I don't know what to do. I love her and I've told her many times that sexually we won't click but she refuses to take no for an answer.

2022-11-11 00:26:02,1,True,0,"Tw: sa, abuse, stalking 

When I was 17 I dated this guy Michael. Michael was a good Christian boy and I wasn’t. I didn’t believe in God and I was bisexual. We ended up loosing our virginities together on Valentine’s Day. 

After a few months he started raping me. Coercion, while I was asleep, wouldn’t stop when I asked him to. One time when we were having sex it was really painful because I was coerced into having sex, I asked him to stop, begged him but he didn’t. The next day I was super upset about it and I asked a mutual friend if she thought what happened was rape and she said “no. Michael is a good Christian boy he would never rape you”. Turns out she just had a crush on him and didn’t want to believe he was a rapist. After 6 months of being raped consistently, I finally left. You probably wonder why I stayed for so long, it’s because everyone told me it wasn’t rape, it was normal. I was mentally abused by him and was a narcissist who would love bomb me at any time I thought about leaving. 

A week after the break up a mutual friend messaged me that he was going to rape me too. 
A month after that a friend of michaels stalked me. He found out where I worked at from Michael, took screenshots of me from michaels account, got hired where I work and sexually harassed me for months. He said he was friends with Michael and Michael gave him permission to date me. This friend made work a living hell. He ended up quitting because people hated how he treated me and all became very rude and distant towards him. 
Two months after that I had one of Michaels friends message me on Instagram to figure out my relationship status. Plus more rape threats. 

It took getting married to get the messages to stop. 

Please don’t ask me why I never reported any of this. I did report the sexual-harassment to my managers at work but nothing to the police. By the time I realized what was happening and that I was able to report it I had no evidence and I feel like it’s all insignificant now.",TrueOffMyChest,My rapist friends stalked me,0.5,2022-11-11

2022-12-15 23:41:38,3,True,1,"My boyfriend (42) and I (34 f) generally get along well, we’ve known each other for five years but our relationship has oscillated between friends, no contact, official, and back again. This relationship has been filled with ups and downs, but we grew so close as friends we would come back together after taking space.

That being said, we are a great creative team. I don’t think either of us has ever laughed harder with another person. That’s why it makes it so hard for me to understand his behavior. When we first started hanging out he insisted that he couldn’t date or be in a relationship. I agreed as I had just gotten out of a long term relationship. I think we were both comfortable with the situation, however within a few months of us hanging out almost every day and consistently having fun I started to notice his dark side. His dark flits in and out often enough to throw me off guard and question everything. 

He becomes nit picky and highly critical over random things for seemingly no reason. I feel like he resents me and I’m not fully sure why. We’ve gotten in bad fights before. There’s been a couple long periods of no contact between us (well on my end anyway, he would still try to contact me.) Last night he broke a boundary and what was so frustrating is it’s something I’ve brought up to him at least once a QWERTY for the past 6 weeks. I’ve asked him many times to not give me unsolicited advice. But it’s like he can’t help himself. The thing that drives me nuts is I won’t even be asking a question or talking about a problem. Yesterday, I told him I was excited about finding Reddit and being able to get all this information and kind words, etc on Reddit. First thing is does is start asking me about my privacy and telling me I’m going to get murdered or dozed and this place is full of creeps and I shouldn’t talk to them. Then he proceeds to demand that I go through my privacy setting with him even though I told him I wasn’t interested in his advice, I’m an adult and I’m highly capable of making good decisions and protecting myself. What is most insane about this was his reaction. “You know the way you can’t accept feedback is concerning.” Excuse me? I didn’t ask for feedback I was telling you something I was happy about, but I will gladly welcome feedback from you if I asked for it. It’s to the point where I cringe thinking about telling him anything because I’m so sick of his patronizing lectures. He said he was just being protective and that I don’t know what I’m doing. Y’all this was just yesterday, but especially lately, and it more so that since I set the boundary he keeps pushing it. 

It’s sort of a recurring theme in our relationship, his dark side. I can’t quite put my finger on it but it seems like he doesn’t trust me to make the right decisions for myself. He says things to scare me almost. If I say I’m going out he tells me many variations of me getting raped if I give men the wrong impression. He did not like any of my male friends and would tell they were just hanging around me to eventually sleep with me. He puts doubts in my head about how I am as a mother and often mentions his abusive mother. Worst of gives me “parenting advice” even though he has no kids, and gets upset if I don’t follow it, than once again mentions how bad his mom messed him up. Anyway these are a just few, yet recurrent grievances he has with me.

Well last night I just set my boundary didn’t talk to him til later. When he point blank asked me if his brothers don’t talk to him anymore because he’s mean. I just answered pretty frankly and said people don’t really want to be around a judgmental person who brings them down and questions their choices left it up that well he writes me back and I think this is the part that confuses me the most where I feel like I’m going crazy. He said I never asked you for advice wow you are disgusting if I want advice or if I want to hear feedback I’ll ask for it then he told me that I’m always trying to tell him what to do and how to act. I very calmly replied that I did not think this relationship was working anymore. I was tired of the indecisiveness the back-and-forth and the disrespect of my boundaries and his passive aggressive behavior towards me I told him I needed some space and I just did not want him to contact me, I would contact him. 

Well I wake up too many lovely voicemails which said some iteration of what are you talking about we are together we are not boyfriend girlfriend we’re friends we’ve always been friends that’s what we are. Literally two days ago he was sending me pictures of engagement rings and we were talking about moving in together in the house that he’s been remodeling and we’ve been on very good terms actually since we got back together we’ve been communicating well and this isn’t all in my head we were in a relationship this time. But he’s trying to tell me that we weren’t in a relationship and that he thinks that we’re better off as friends. Almost like he’s trying to one up me or act as though I was being dramatic or I was being sensitive or misunderstood the situation. And it’s not uncommon for him to flip things around completely after I just said something to him him saying the same thing back to me. I don’t know how to describe this behavior but I would love to have a word for it so I could better understand and maybe do some more research on it.

At this point I honestly  I’m  at my wits end and I think I want to cut it off for good but I would like to understand his behavior a little more. Maybe in this way I can learn more about myself and what I do to trigger this behavior in others or just what causes him to act like this. I want to make sense of it all. I guess I just want to understand thisbetter and stop feeling so confused.

TLDR: My boyfriend doesn’t respect my boundaries. Our recent interactions have left me so confused and feeling so betrayed and I think I should end it for good but I want to understand his behavior more.",relationship_advice,His behavior is making feel like I’m going insane.

We were sending texts and pictures like dumb teenagers, but I didn't know at the time he was screen shoting and saving all that stuff. He would also share them with his friends. During the one time we were doing the deed at school (Gross and stupid, I know) I told him I wanted to stop, but he kept telling me that we should do it. I ended up relenting because I felt weak and vulnerable and like 'no' wasn't an option. Just a bit later I wanted out, so I tried, and he was forcing my head to go down on him. I said no, but I don't even know if he heard me or not. I'm disgusted with myself and even now, almost a year later, I can still feel it. When it was finally over, I avoided him and cut any contact with him. This year he would show up in my friend circle and just seeing him made me shake and panic violently.

Nothing came of it because they all wanted to forgive him or forget him, and his sister never got back to me. He went after the most vulnerable people I know, and I retaliated by loudly talking near or around him, whenever he showed up, about how he's done so many horrible things and that he should just die. He was reported for most of the sexual harassment and assault claims, and through a friend, I learned that he was supposedly threatened with criminal action. I told my closest friends about what he did to me, and he found out and was telling people I was a liar. He admitted to what he did while still denying he raped me.

Tldr: my husband broke my trust and boundaries how do we move forward from this, is there a way to come back from this. ( Nsfw some kink mentioned)

I do not give permission for this to be shared.please forgive grammar and format it has never been my best skill.

I 32(f) have been with my husband 32(m) since highschool 14 years there have been a few hiccups over the years but they were often due to still learning how to have open communication and finding ways to set healthy boundaries. For background info my husband has always enjoyed exploring any new kinks together I never felt shame for bringing up something I wanted to try and I thought he felt the same with me. 
up until very recently I have always felt very safe, and loved in my relationship however I felt as tho there have been some red flags popping up recently husband has been attached to his phone more often and seemed a bit cagey if I looked at his screen when he was on discord which I knew he used for games primarily. I have pretty bad anxiety and between that and the behaviour I cracked and looked at his old phone that he still had logged into everything while he was out ( I know this in itself is a breach of trust I will not defend it, it was wrong I did apologize for this) what I found upset me ( a server he had joined for furry content)  it wasn't the content itself that hurt  I knew it was a kink of his and I had never judged or shamed him for it but the fact that it had the ability to join discussions around the content and be apart of the community, and he had never discussed if I was comfortable with this. To me if he was taking apart conversations without my knowledge he may as well have been cheating, inviting other people into our kinks is a hard boundary for me. There were so many tabs that I could not look at them all to determine if he was chatting and found nothing in his DMS. When he got home I confronted him about the red flags only to give him an opportunity to be honest with me he got defensive so I asked to see his phone he complied after a few mins as he was swiping on his phone. When he handed it over he had deleted all DMS as well as the server he was apart of. At that point I felt heartbroken because it had proven that he was lying to me I then told him I had snooped and knew what was actually on his discord. He didn't imideatly apologise I actually had to fight with him for him to see how he just ruined the trust I had with him. He said he deleted it because he had been planning to anyways and that he felt shame for the kink which to me is so stupid because he had already been open about it before. He also swears he never took part of the conversations he was just there for the content as it's sparce on other platforms that don't have chat. I feel like my heart has been shattered I don't even know if I can trust his explanation or his insistence that he wasn't chatting with others. He broke my trust violated our emotional intimacy and I just don't know where to go from here. I still love him but idk how he's gonna make this right I feel like I'm always gonna be demanding to see his phone or peeking over his shoulder and I don't want to feel like I have to do that for the rest of our life's. I honestly considered leaving him as soon as he lied to me instead of coming clean but he has always been my best friend in every way I can't even imagine what life would be like without him I want hugs and comfort from him but then I don't even want him to touch me I feel almost disgusted by it because I feel so betrayed.

My boyfriend said he hates when I go visit my family because I dated my brothers best friend like three years ago. We didn’t even have sex as he is quite religious and waiting till marriage. We dated for two months but he infrequently messaged me and we were both busy with life. 

Two years ago I started to date my boyfriend. 

I am visiting my family for the holidays. He just now addressed his uneasiness with me dating my brothers friend and said that’s why he has been distant for the past week of me visiting my family. 

My brothers friend who I dated hung out with my fam on Christmas stayed on my parents couch as his flight home on Christmas was cancelled and my brother didn’t want him to spend it alone. 

My boyfriend said that he gets pissed when I go to visit my fam because I potentially will see my brothers friend. He seemed livid and I had no idea what to say as he has never mentioned this before and I literally do not care about my brothers friend romantically at all.

He said he doesn’t want to ever visit my dads family because the situation is just so awkward. 

He said he knows we had sex and that I told him that and I was like…..? He literally is very religious and told me he was waiting for marriage and everyone who knows him knows this. 

He asked me why I would do that? Why I would date someone who I may have to see all the time in the future. I told him that it seemed like a good idea at the time. He is a nice person. I was single for two years already. He was a good person and my fam could vouch for him being a good person and he lived in the same city as me so we started to go on dates. I have messaged telling my friends it would take him three days to text me back so it wasn’t that serious. 

What am I supposed to say or do? Mind you he just mentioned this to me after I addressed the reason for my trust issues was him still having nudes of his ex saved but not mine saved and that I have won’t let me look at his phone when he looks through my phone when I sleep without me knowing

2022-12-27 06:18:58,16,True,2,"i'll get straight to the point, i've (19f) been in a relationship with a guy (23m) for 3 months now and sometimes i feel like i'm expecting him to think about me or care more, enough to go out of his way to do things that he never does. 

i was leaving for a vacation over christmas and mentioned that i wanted to drop his gift (a sweater) off beforehand. he kind of went ""oh no, but i don't have a gift for you yet. i'll have one after you come back, so let's see each other then."" (for reference, he comes from a different culture than the other previous boyfriend i had, who was canadian like me) 
i just called him and when i mentioned bringing his gift again and he said ""oh no"" again but when i asked what, he said ""never mind."" i'm seeing him tomorrow, and i'm really worried that there will be awkwardness if he forgot about what he said (the gift thing) before i left. 
i also feel like the novelty of new relationship has worn off already. he spends time on his phone when we hang out, always takes way too long in the washroom when i'm at his house (like a disrespectful amount of time to the point where he keeps me waiting for like 15 mins), and kind of treats cuddling and kissing as a chore. to top it all off, we haven't had sex in 2 months because he doesn't like condoms (he won't make me go on birth control, and he keeps saying he's going to get a vasectomy, but we just don't have sex anymore and every time we get intimate, it always ends up with me finishing him off. i don't get off at all.) 

i don't mean to compare, but despite the fact that my ex and i were not compatible personality wise, i NEVER had any of these issues with him, and i NEVER doubted that he loved me or was thinking about me. 

i'm not sure where to go at this point. are my standards too high, and if so, should i confront him about it? he does work 6 days a week usually so i feel like i'm being too expectant, but i also don't think any of my complaints are invalid. what do i do???",TrueOffMyChest,are my standards too high?,9.0,2022-12-27

From what I could gather from his vague answers the taste and smell are not really the problem,  it's just that he does not like the activity. Now I know I should not pressure him into performing any sexual acts he does not want to do, yet it's one of the few things that really gets me turned on and makes the sex amazing for me. I've told him that it is important to me and that it might be a dealbreaker, so I proposed trying out different things to see if he might like any of that stuff better (dental dams, flavoured lube, different positions like 69). He had not brought it up nor taken initiative to try stuff out with me (and I'm definitely open to stopping whenever he gets too uncomfortable). From his dismissive and frustrated responses I've become reluctant to bring up the topic again.

Before I get comments like 'don't give him bjs' I personally think sex shouldn't be so transactional, and as I like giving him bjs I wouldn't really want to stop that either. 
It does feel a little unfair if I'm honest, though, but I feel bad about feeling that way. 

He has a lot going on such as depression and I can imagine sex not being on his mind much because of it. He's working on that currently. 

Is it fair of me to ask him to try stuff with me, or would that also be pressuring him towards doing something he doesn't like? Should I expect some initiative from him to try and meet me half way or should I respect his preferences? I really don't want to break up over not receiving oral, yet it does feel like a dealbreaker if I can't ask him to try to work something out with me.

2022-01-25 16:31:38,20,True,2,"I’d like to preface that my choice is not religious, but partially cultural and mostly related to statistics and wanting the *best* partnership I can possibly have with him.

Last night I had an epiphany of sorts: Over the weekend when he was at my place, I felt very disconnected to him, and I told him I wanted us to interact more before he left for home. We didn’t end up doing much together — We’ve been lacking in the communication department, and balancing free time with together time.

But then we had sex before he left. And it slipped from my mouth, something like “I’m glad we at least had sex. Now that I feel connected, it’s OK if you go back on the computer &amp; do your own thing.”

Yet soon after, I was once again feeling lonely and he was gone.

It hit me that I’m simultaneously getting bored with sex and I feel like I don’t know who he is. We don’t know how to support each other. Most of our relationship consists of spiraling away into ADD (we both have it) and never making time for anything, for ourselves individually or each other… *And sex is a great bandaid solution for all that.*

I have even, at times, thought “We don’t have much going for us right now, but at least we are compatible sexually.”

He has a caring and wonderful person and takes care of me when I’m sick or down, but I want us to connect even more and honestly I think’s sex gets in the way. 

I have read articles that, statistically speaking, couples who practice abstinence until marriage report better sex and better relationship happiness, *and lower rates of divorce.*

I realize now that I’m not even sure if he *wants* to marry me (we are fully committed in terms of dating and he has said “I’m never going anywhere else, never leaving you” but that’s not enough!). He’s getting the benefits of a committed partnership with me without ever having to tie the knot. And what if he gets bored? I’m already getting bored. There has to be something we can do to get to know each other better. 

From what I read, couples who practice abstinence are happy *not* because their vaginas are closed or whatever, *not* because of “avoiding sins”, but rather because they’ve gotten to know each other on an emotionally intimate level before sex. 

And, *lower divorce rates*? SIGN ME UP. I want a happier relationship. I want a lasting one. If this is the path to get it, and this is what I want. But how can I explain this to him without scaring him off? 

I think it will still be beneficial to practice abstinence from now on, despite what we’ve done before. 

Early on in the friendship, he expressed his desire to practice abstinence till marriage, citing that while he isn’t religious, he believes the idea works (just like me!) but then he did a 180 and said he wanted to do it with a bunch of girls and that was an issue for us but we fixed it when we started dating (I secured myself as his first). At least I know there was one point where he was OK with it?

I need your advice: How can I bring it up without being hurtful or sounding like I’m withholding sex to hurt him? And should I bring it up via phone call or in person? I can hardly wait til next weekend — it feels too important to me.

**TL;DR:** I’m in a sexually active relationship and I notice that we jumped to sex too quickly. It’s an easy, quick way to feel connected but I worry we are ignoring critical parts of our relationship, like communication and time management. I want to start practicing abstinence from now on so we can focus on building emotional strength between us (I think it’s possible for both of us)… And, studies show that couples who wait report higher sexual satisfaction, higher relationship satisfaction, and lower divorce rates. I’m *very* serious about having the best kind of relationship we can have, and lowering our chance for future divorce. But I honestly don’t know if he feels the same way. I need your advice: How can I communicate this to him? I’ve bagged him in the past and I don’t want him to shrink back in fear.

I hated school life or anything to do with my peers because they were either beating me up or they were my “friends” and I got to be aware of their burgeoning sex lives which made me jealous and resentful. I turned more and more to porn because it didn’t judge me, or hit me, or shove me into a wall, or laugh at me in front of everyone if I asked it out; porn was a safe and familiar space in a cruel and miserable world, and it appeared to satisfy a primal urge.

I no called, no showed, several times in a row. By all logic, I should have been terminated. Apparently, I wasn’t. Even a month later.

What happened was that I had gotten the news of a very bad man who did very bad things to me had gone to jail. He had sexually assaulted/abused me. For months. *Months* on end. My life during 2021 was constant hell. It fucked me up pretty severely mentally, and even physically for awhile. But this is good news, right? Fucker’s in jail.

It was good news. But it meant I had to start talking to detectives. Start telling my story to mutual friends. Explain over and over what hurt me.

i (20F) went to the gyno the other day for unrelated reasons to this posts concern. while i was there my doctor noticed something that was off &amp; took a swab/test.

i tested positive for the sti no woman wants.

i am in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend (22M). we’ve been officially together for about 5 months, but have been on &amp; off for the past 2 years.

about 6 months ago, i caught this same sti unknowingly from someone that wasn’t giving me full information about their sexual acts. i didn’t figure it out until a month later &amp; went to get tested &amp; got treatment. during this time my boyfriend (ex at the time) was showing me signs of him being interested in me again. (a lot has happened. especially during that time. he hurt me in many ways). but i so desperately wanted him back. so, i broke things off with that sexual partner &amp; i told my ex about him since he had planned to come into town surprisingly early (we hadn’t seen each other in a long time since he had left). obviously, i had to tell him we couldn’t have sex.

during the time that he was here, i was still on the week of my treatment. we *did* have sex. after i asked him multiple times if he was sure. we used condoms. until the last day. when i first had this infection, the doctor didn’t inform me about much of it &amp; i didn’t really look into it. i should have. so, we both thought it would be okay to use no condoms on the 7th day of my treatment. i don’t even remember how many times we had sex. probably 2-3 times that day.

i say all of this after had having to *calm down*. the doctor confirmed that this could easily be a case of us just passing it back and forth. especially because he came back 3 weeks later &amp; of course we had unprotected sex. so, now that i’ve calmed &amp; done more research im able to present this situation logically.

my boyfriend is an amazing person. he hasn’t always been great to me, but he has tried &amp; improved so much since the beginning of our relationship. i can see that he truly loves me. i feel like it. i really really do. and i love him. he is my best friend. i just don’t see him ever doing anything shady like cheating to me. i know to take what reddit says with a grain of salt, because at the end of the day i’m the one that knows him best. but i’m an anxious person. of course the thought has crossed my mind. but i just really don’t think that’s the case.

do i need to worry?? the doctor made it seem like it really wasn’t a big deal, and that that is probably exactly what happened, and logical me tells me that that’s true.

edit: i also want to add that i *did* get tested right after he left again. like i said, i did not do my research. and apparently just because that test came back negative (2 days after potentially being exposed *again*) does not mean that it wasn’t present in my body. i’ve read that it takes at least 2 weeks before it can show up on any test.",relationship_advice,I need advice/reassurance,2.5,2022-04-07

They have  also cut back on our bonuses as well as making all PTO time unpaid.

Besides the religious emails, donations, and rhetoric they have imposed on our company they further slap us in the face by coming to work driving Rolls Royces and Bentley's which they park out front for everyone to see.

It is very one-sided and not as often as I would like to get the intimacy I need. I have brought this up to her time and time again and it seems like there’s always a different reason why she does not want to have sex as much. I respect her boundaries to say no but I also have needs physical and intimacy.  She is an incredibly beautiful woman with a VERY high sex drive.  I know her like the back of my hand and she is an extremely sexual person but I respect whatever her reason may be that she gives me when she does not want to have sex.  So I started to masturbate.   I told her that I don’t masturbate when we first started dating but that was because I didn’t need to because we were having sex frequently and it felt natural and satisfying and she didn’t make me feel like I was burdening her. So instead of trying to have sex with her today, I decided to masturbate instead. I have brought it up time and time again that I would like to have sex with her more often and it has not changed so I decided at the alternate solution. She walked in on me doing it. She looked deeply upset and offended.  She didn’t even say anything and just left our apartment.  I would like the opportunity to explain myself to her.  I would also like to understand why she got so deeply upset, although I suppose that could be because I told her a long time ago that I do not masturbate.

They’re really big on physical touch, like giving people hugs, “friendly” kisses, (i hate this, i’m autistic and i can’t stand hugs or being touched.) and even being naked in front of me for no reason because “it’s not weird and we’re just friends.” i’ve made it clear i’m not okay with it. 

now this friend and i are VERY close, like best friends. we’re constantly together, basically a package deal. Lately they’ve been pushing my boundaries SO far, for example giving me kisses on the forehead as a way of trying to make me feel better, telling me they love me every single chance they get, hugging me, “jokingly” asking to make out etc. lately i’ve been distancing myself as much as i can, which is rude, i know, but i figure it’s better to just give myself space to calm down instead of yelling in their face. i hung out with another group in one of my classes that we share, and i made it clear i didn’t want to talk. they asked me if everything was okay and i said we need to set up better boundaries and left it at that.

Well today we got into an argument because they were laughing at something while looking me in the eye and i got frustrated because they wouldn’t tell me. i jokingly said “stop being so cryptic” and they blew. the fuck. up. they started yelling at me saying I was the cryptic one, i don’t have the right to just up and leave whenever i feel like it, and that i was an asshole. i just packed up my things and left the spot we were sitting and now we aren’t talking.

i kind of feel like TA because maybe i should’ve explained to them why i was being weird, but we had also talked about having a discussion later on about boundaries, because that wasn’t a conversation i wanted to have at that moment.

2022-05-12 17:26:49,14,True,65,"I (19M) am a college student. My sister (17F) had this obnoxious friend who we'll call Stacy (18F). I knew her a little bit from high school. I guess Stacy got kicked out of her house and needed a place to live. My mom being the kind hearted person she is let her stay at our house. Since I wasn't living there she took my bedroom and when I visited which was often since my college was close, I'd sleep on the couch. That's fine. I'm not mad about that. 
The first month she was there, everytime I saw her she'd flirt with me. One day she cornered me and kissed me. I told her I wasn't interested and this of course pissed her off. She started breaking things that belonged to me. Throwing parties and trashing things. I told my mom and sister that she needs to be more respectful of our stuff. My mom ignored me and said she was fine. My sister took my side. This led to their friendship ending. Great. Now she'll move out. NOT.
Stacy stayed 8 months and during this time she bullied my sister and kept getting me in trouble with my mom. One day my sister told me that Stacy got an abortion a month after prom night and used my mom's money to pay for it. I shrugged it off. I wasn't a petty person. It was none of my business. It also got revealed to me that during these parties she threw at our house she had a lot of hardcore drugs. Since I was never there for them I couldn't prove it to my mom at the time who was fed up with my bullshit. She also started stealing money from my mom to buy expensive clothes. It was a mess that I had to deal with since my mom and sister ignored it. Oh well.
After these 8 months of partying and theft were up, Stacy went to go live in Texas with her weird uncle. I thought it was all over until she visited for Thanksgiving unannounced. The whole day Stacy bullied me and my sister but acted kind and sweet to my mother. When she left, I told my mom the next time she was here I wasn't going to be polite. I texted Stacy and told her, my sister and my mom that if she every came back I was going to tell my mom about her secrets.
6 months later Stacy shows up. Did she think I forgot about my promise? As soon as I saw Stacy I warned her that I was going to tell my mom if she didn't leave. She laughed it off like I was kidding. I wasn't. I told my mom about the abortion she got back in April and that she did it with my mom's money. I told her about the drugs and the stealing. My sis even pulled out text messages between Stacy and her of her bullying my sister. As soon as this all came out Stacy started cussing me out and yelling. I was just laughing at her. She was showing my mom her true colors. She leaves.
My mom told me it wasn't my business to publicly out all of her dirty laundry. Even after all this she's still my mom's perfect adoptive daughter.

Later I told her I was worried and asked her if she thought about hooking up with him. I honestly wasn’t expecting her answer to be yes, I was beyond hurt because it made me feel so set aside. And then she dropped the bombshell that she just wanted to be friends, claiming she wasn’t going to fuck around but wasn’t ready for a relationship.

I said I can’t do that because I can not forget my love for you, I have done so much for her, bended so many of my values. She told me I was tiring, exhausting, my emotional support puppy, and told me if she put up with my shit, no one else would. She claims she didn’t say the last part, but I very vividly remember and it hurts like a hot knife.

I offered so many times to travel so we could meet, and every time we got close to it, an argument happened so we called it off. Yes we were long distance and yes it started like that, but it doesn’t change the fact I loved her.

So I blocked her, I knew in my head I couldn’t heal when she was hurting me, but everything in my heart said I want to be with her. She reached out asking to be friends, I told her I can’t just forget love. She did that three times, most recently being yesterday.

She reached out, begging for me in her life because she is lonely, she says she wants me, but I tell her I still love her so how can she expect me to be just friends? She said that she doesn’t want a relationship but still loves me as a friend, that hurt so bad because I did everything for her, I tried my hardest, I loved her with every part of my being, and she wanted to let it go. 

I asked her if she started dating and told me she lost her virginity a month ago, I felt the most powerless I had in a long time, all those memories we had, they felt like nothing, all the offers I made felt cast aside, all the times I stayed up late to help her through her problems, they all felt forgotten. I said I was happy for her, but honestly I just felt a hole in my stomach

She begged to be friends but how can i forget this? I asked her if she could learn to love again, she said that she needs time as just friends, and even then it’s a maybe.

I can’t risk my mental health on a maybe, the idea was so amazing, but she wasn’t willing to put up the work to repair or restart our relationship, so I asked her to block me, because each time it’s so hard to block her.

She said no because she needs me, and told me she saw my posts on Reddit and is worried about me, but I know she only wants to not miss me, because each time she reaches out it hurts a little more. 

So I blocked her, I didn’t want her reaching out again, so I made all new accounts, starting over. And that hurts so much because it feels like it’s my fault, the only thing stopping me is the small barrier of being blocked, but I know she forced my hand, and it hurts so much.

She started taking medication for ADHD around the same time it started to drop off so she claims its the medication dropping her sex drive. She listens to a lot of sex/relationship podcasts and claims to understand how important a healthy sexual relationship is but never seems to put it into action.

If we do have sex its usually after me mentioning how little we have sex so it seems like she does it only to silence me. It's also very much the same everytime, its missionary for a while till she cums and then we stop. She is very sensitive down there so sex never goes for longer than 15min and majority of the time I dont get to cum. When it comes to blow jobs, theyre also very rare and she seems to get over it rather quickly so I try to cum faster so she doesn't need to be down there for long.

In the past 2 years we've had sex maybe 10 times and its extremely disheartening to think your partner has no sexual urges or drive towards you. I have also been cheated on in the past so I have issues when my partner becomes less intimate with me. So the past 2 years have been difficult for me, which I have mentioned to her countless times.

There is not a single fucking thing that does not send him into a mother fucking tails

It was his idea to invite my nephew to live with us. He made the moves to get him a job and made it happen. My nephew is over the moon happy. 

I seriously considered divorcing him before this all happened. After a lot of consideration I decided to stick with it for love. For some reason I do love this man. My nephew has been here for 5 days and I already regret allowing this to happen.  I regretted it by the end of the first day.

Before this was set in stone we had the talk about the weed smoking.

Me: so now that you have copd you are going to quit weed when our nephew gets here?

Him: yeah I am killing myself by continuing to smoke weed

Me: ok because I have an evangelical brother who would not be happy with me if you were a bad influence

Him: no way I would let that happen

So i wasn't worried at all about things going south, you know loosing my last family of origin family member who means the world to me

My nephew was here a few hours we moved his stuff into an extra bedroom and we drove down to my house to drop off some extra furniture that was in the way.  My family was in the truck. Hubs and I are alone in the car.

Him: So I guess now I can't smoke weed anymore

Me: we discussed this

Him: everyone else gets what they want but I can't work on my cars . (He has no garage at his house. He has wanted to build one but he doesn't not want to pay for it himself)

Me: already desperate and ready to blow things up. alright I'll just tell my family you smoke weed and I'll let them decide what to do.

Him: no don't do that I guess I'll just deal with it. I just don't know how much more I can take because everyone gets what they want but me

My thoughts: *i should just divorce him. But ever time I leave I go back.l because he gaslights me into thinking I am crazy*

Me: you should build a garage

Him: with what money?  I need that for my upgrade on my c5 and I need to start buying parts for my tempest. So I guess I'll just be miserable and maybe kill myself

Me: you can smoke weed I don't care you just have to hide it

Him: yeah but now I can't just sit on the couch  I'll have to go outside 

Me : yes well you understand you are threatening my relationship with my brother and you know how I feel about this. (Hint: it would break my heart for reasons too complex to explain now)

Him : I don't want to have to walk on eggshells in my own house.

We ended up having sex. This is somewhat important to the story. During part of it, we were almost in 69 but she wasn’t quite on my face. We did our thing and both finished.

She had actually had a few drinks earlier but not nearly enough to be drunk. During this game we were just having a good time, joking around with some of the Randoms in the game. After about 10 minutes she starts making sexual comments, For example. We would ask stupid questions like 'do you drink water?' or 'do you eat hotdogs?' just for random humor, but when my GF would join in, she would say 'I like sucking d\*\*\*'. It was odd but I didn't really care. But as time went on she would talk to the guys and start flirting with them directly. For example, the was a guy who would keep knifing her at the beginning of the round and she would respond with 'Hey, you keep knifing me. Do you have something for me?' Eventually one of them started complimenting her and asked if he could do something with her, to where she flirted 'yea, you could do that, I don't mind.' The part that really hurt was when one of the guys said 'Dude you got your in' following her response.

After that I instantly left the game, left the call, went on do not disturb. Flirting with other guys was exactly what I had to deal with in a previous relationship where my ex had fully cheated physically. Now, my GF is not an e-girl or internet girlfriend, we've been dating before she ever got a PC. I've never seen her act like this in our whole relationship. Following she called me asking what's wrong and I texted her how she was flirting with other guys in front of me and how we set a firm boundary at the beginning of the relationship for no flirting with other people. And by that obviously like hockey, actor, music or firefighter flirting idc about. Afterwards she responded saying ""But you flirt with people, so wtf'. By that she is referring how myself and my guy friends will jokingly flirt with each other but we're straight, she is a straight girl flirting with straight guys. In my opinion, I think there's a big difference between the two.

This is gonna be a long ride because I have to get some things off my chest and I moved to a foreign country and I kinda need to rant a bit.

EDIT: TL;DR at the bottom but I'd appreciate if you read it as a whole.

Me(23M) and my now ex(24F) were together for 2 years. The relationship was amazing except for the last 3 months. She's been my rock. In our relationship, we ALWAYS no matter what the circumstances were supported each other. She was religious, I'm not. She wanted to wait until marriage for PIV sex but we were still very active sexually. Only no was PIV. I never asked for more because I was so in love with her that this new ""normal"" was enough for me and I was satisfied. Our communication was so strong. She loved me deeply. She had some big issues with her family and I was her everything. We were on the same Uni and same degree but she was 2 years above me. She was a brilliant student. I'm more of a ""Doing the bare minimum to get passable grades"" kind of guy. She even supported me on lessons and my GPA was over the roof after I met her. I also helped her a lot both mentally and physically so you got the picture.

But, over the course of the relationship, things changed. She started to get annoyed by me and accused me with being childish most of the time. I was always told by my friends and family that I was much more mature than my age.  But I guess that wasn't enough for her. At the start of the relationship, we started as long distance. I'm not really using social media that much so she only ever saw a couple of photos of me when we first met. The first time we met on Instagram, we started talking for DAYS. We were 7/24 speaking and we both felt the connection. After 1 month, she came to my city to visit me and it was like we were together for years. We both never felt that kind of bond and passion before. After that we became official. Because of the pandemic, unis were closed so that's why we were on different cities. After that first official date, I took a big step and moved to her city, which our unis were located. I had a challenge in mind. My family always supported me with everything. I know that I'm self sufficiant for the most part but I was eager to find out if I could survive and stand on my own feet without my families help. So I stopped getting any financial help from them. I moved to that city, got a job and for a month I staid in a hostel. My ex was a HUGE help. She was with me on the every step of the way. After that first month, I moved to a friend's house so I started living with a friend of mine. My ex even offered to pay half my rent because she was working and gaining twice the money I was. Of course I said no and after a while, my friend moved out from the house so I started paying double the rent but all was good because I actually like living alone. My gf was living with her parents. We both were working and studying so we were seeing each other 3-4 days a week at first.

Because of my high grades my gf actually motivated me to move to Europe for 1 or 2 semesters for an exchange program. She also did that exchange program before meeting me and she was always talking about how important a lesson that was for her. It changed her view of life and she was always saying that it's an experience everyone should gain. Even as a child I always wanted to go abroad and learn about different cultures so I was of course on board. She help me study for the tests and I was selected! After that, things kinda took a turn. She was super happy for me but at the same time she became much much more emotional. I mean I'm also an emotional person so seeing her crying made me cry. She was both very happy for me but also super heartbroken because we'll be ldr again. At first I planned to go for 2 semesters but seeing her like that and also being the crazy stupid lover I am, I decided maybe I should call it off. I was ready to cancel all the plans but she gave me a huge speech and encouraged me that no matter what happens I should go and live that experience. Whether she was in the picture or not. So I decided that  I'd go for only 1 semester as a compromise. She was reluctant but ultimately very happy. But whenever the Europe comes up to the conversation we were both very emotional. She was having lots of insecurity issues that maybe when I go there I'd left her or get bored of her and the ldr situation. Let me tell you this; I've NEVER been unfaithful to her and never even entertained any flirtious moves. Same goes for her.

Anyways, the last couple of weeks and months were really rocky because the stress was huge, she graduated and started working on her dream job. We were constantly fighting but always sticked with eachother.  2 weeks before my flight, we had a HUGE fight and I said some nasty things to her so we broke up.  We didn't speed for a week, I was with my parents so I was in my home city. For my last week I moved back to my house at her city to set things straight with her. We got back together and talked for a LONG LONG time to figure things out and eliminate the toxicity.

It was such a relief because we were really arguing constantly before that. After that talk we became much more closer. She started a vlog just for me to see and watch while I was away. The day has come. We went to the airport together. I flew. I got into the dorm room while I was face timing her. We saw my new room together for the first time. We decorated it together. I made my first grocery shopping with her. We were doing everything together as much as we can. The first week was really good. I started making some friends in here. There was like a 8 people group and they invited me out so I said yes. Also told her that and she was a bit uncomfortable because she didn't know the other people and told me that don't be late. There were some time gap between our countries so It was really late for her when I was out. She kept on preassuring me to come home because it was getting late but it wasn't on my timezone. I didn't wanna upset her so I went home early. I was keep on compromising but her jealousy got out of hand. She was very restrictive. I made 2 girl friends in here and they were from my country and even the same uni same program as me and my gf's. She knew them but not really much. Only by name. Those 2 girls, let's call them Carly and Jane, they were super friendly with me and they were well aware that I had a girlfriend which they also met her in person on the classes before. She was even jealous of them inviting me out or helping me out around the city. We started fighting again. I was trying to please her by not going to social get togethers much. But I've noticed that I wasn't making any progress. We, again had a huge fight because she was telling me that since I came here I changed. I stopped prioritising her and loving her. I keep on trying to convince her that I was doing my best to no avail. Jane and I really hit it off. She had a humor just like mine. We were vibing like crazy. She was undoubtly incredibly attractive but we were both friends. We were calling ourselves by ""Bro, king, fam, brother, sister etc.""

I started getting distant with my gf because we were always fighting and she was really making my life miserable. When I wasn't talking to her, I actually enjoyed my life here but as soon as I get my phone and started talking to her things goes to hell. I had a duty to 7/24 assuring her that I still love her and still care about her. Jane and I started doing activities together. City tours, going to classes together, going to bars and my gf hated that and again we had a huge fight. I told her that I want to break up with her. Because I couldn't. I literally couldn't anymore. I still loved her so very much but things were toxic as hell. Don't get me wrong, I was also being a dick to her. Because she made me live hell on earth in here so I was not happy. She was not happy either.

She practically begged me to stay and she'd fix things. She gave me lots of promises and lots of oaths to completely solve all of our problems and if I go and leave her, she'd be dead. She said that she can't live without me and I was her everything and ever since I was gone to another country she messed up, she had no joy in life except me etc. So of course I was convinced and I gave the relationship another shot.  Lo and behold, after 2 days we had a fight again. Jane was inviting me to a house party and she said that why is she always on your ass, why can't she even breath without me etc. etc. and I told that I'll go to the party beause ever since I came here I was always at home and I was feeling left out. She told me not to go but I did go. We had the ugliest fight ever and I, again broke up with her. I was also sharing these situations with Jane without going into details. Only saying that things were rocky between me and my gf and that I can't continue with the relationship etc. I told Jane that me and my gf broke up an it's final. She grabbed me by the arm and we went to a bar to get high and talk about it.

We were drunk and we were living in the same apartment complex. I escorted her to her room and than I went to my room. after maybe 20mins she called me and invited me to her room to show me something. When I went into her room, she was wearing a lingerie and there were lights, candles everywhere. I was shocked. I was just staying in the door. She quickly grabbed me and dragged me to the room. She started making out with me but I was both high and I was miserable because of the break up. I told her to stop but she didn't. I mean I was also going with the flow, partially. Things got heated and we were on her bed but I again said stop. I JUST broke up with my gf and I can't do this right now. I mean I knew for a fact that I couldn't even get it up even if I had tried because my mind wasn't in the game. She said that she wanted to cuddle with me and sleep together. I didn't want to at first but I was wasted and said okay. We cuddled and went to sleep. Around midnight I woke up and she was making out with me again. I participated for a couple of minutes and than stopped and said I can't do this let's just sleep. She just went to sleep, so was I. The following day we went to a cinema together. After we came home she invited me her room again, I went with her. We talked about the movie, played some Q/A games and started making out again. This time I didn't say no because I really found her incredibly attractive and couldn't say no again and again that much.

To no surprise, I couldn't get it up. She tried really hard but... No. All I could think about was I was betraying my girlfriend even though we broke up. She always had issues with Jane, while I was defending her as my friend. Jane got in to a really bad mood and asked me If I find her attractive. I said of course, very much. She than asked, then why are you keep rejecting me? If you don't wanna be with me just tell me. I told her that I really like her and really find her attractive but my mind is all over the place and I can't concentrate. She then turned her back on me and started to sleep. I went back to my room. The following day, she invited me out and we had a date. It was really good. I was feeling ""normal"" again after a very long time.  In the meantime, my ex was bombarding me with text and begging me to get back. I told her again that I can't be with her anymore. She kept calling me and saying nasty things for leaving her behind.

After that date, me and Jane finally had sex. It was amazing! I was describing myself as a high libido person but Jane was even more so than me. She was limitless in bed. We had sex 6 times on that day. She was making me feel incredible. I wasn't having PIV sex for 2+ years so I was like a teenage boy again. We had sex everyday, everywhere. We were cooking together, going to school together, going to our part time jobs together, going to parties together and I started living in her room. We were living a couples life but never had THE talk. So one day we were clubbing and a girl approached me, she was making advances on me, Jane saw that and just pushed the other girl. Jane was upset and angry. Told me that if she wasn't there I wouldn't decline that girl's advances. I calmed her down and when we went home, we talked. I said okay, If you wanna be exclusive, I'm down. But, loyalty is a two way street. If I'm asking it from you then you're getting it from me. She agreed. We started officially. It was 2 weeks after I broke up with my ex.

Again, we were on a party together. She was being the DJ so I was alone most of the time. After awhile she joined the group and started dancing.  I saw a guy came up to her from behing and held her waist. He was grinding her. I observed. She kept on dancing, basically allowing that. I went to her and said give me the keys. She was shocked. I repeated. She said what is going on. I told her that I'll pack my things so give me the keys. She dragged me to a private room to talk. She said that that guy was her friend and he meant no harm so she couldn't just push him away. It would be rude. I called bs. I said that was incredibly disrespectful and I want to have nothing with her. She started crying. She said that she never had a romantic relationship before and she didn't know the boundries. She didn't think dancing would be a dealbreaker for me. If she knew why would she do that right in front of my eyes. I then again asked for the keys. She said that If you're not gonna sleep with me tonight, then we'll never sleep together in the same bed again. I said don't threaten me. I won't sleep with you tonight because honestly you digust me right now. She cried and gave me the keys. I packed my shit and went back to my place. Not long after, maybe 20 mins, she came to my door. Tried to talk and fix things but I wanted space.

The following day she came to me again and apologised and promised me that this will never happen again. I took her word for it. Things were awesome for a couple of weeks. We were still having lots and lots of sex and doing activities together as a couple. One night we went to clubbing with friends, it was 5am while we were going home and it was a 40mins walk. It was freezing outside and I was only wearing a shirt. I was freezing. I jumped and made burpees while walking to keep myself warm. She played some music and we were both drunk. We went silent. It was a silent 15-20mins and I just concentrated on keeping myself warm. She had her jacked so she was fine. When we got home she was SUPER MOODY. I asked her what's wrong. She said that if I cared for her and looked at her once I'd see that she was crying the whole way home. I was like, Wtf? I'm sorry if I made something to hurt you, why were you crying? She said nevermind. I said, No. Can you please talk to me? She said she wants to sleep. I asked her to cuddle me to warm me up because I was still freezing. She told me that she wants to sleep alone. I was hurt but I said okay and went back to my place. The later day I never approached her or typed her or called her. It was the only day we never speak since we first met.

I slept at around 1 am and I woke up with a door knock. It was 4-5am. I opened the door and it was her. She was incredibly drunk. She started to making out with me on the door but I stopped her and make her sit down. She said that she's super drunk. I said yeah, I can see that. She told me, You  didn't reach out to me today. I said, yeah. She said, don't you love  me anymore? I said, this has nothing to do with my love. You're drunk. Let's just sleep and we'll talk later. She said she's gonna puke and she got up. I thought she was going to the bathroom so I said I'll come with you. She said, no. I don't want you right now. I said, okay but you're in a bad place right now, let me help you. She said no again and just went. I waited 5-10mins and I just wanted to check up on her if she made it to her room so I walked on the hallway and looked around. After that I knocked on her door. She opened, I told her are you okay? She said yes but I'm gonna sleep. I said, okay can we talk in a more available time? I don't know what's going on. She said she didn't want to talk. I said that I'm asking to talk twice now but she keeps rejecting me. She said that she just wants to sleep. I said okay and went back to my room.

The following day a mutual friend of mine invited me to a club. I asked her if Jane is coming. She said no, we'll just be 4 people. I said okay. I then again went to Jane's room before the event to sort things out. She said she's also coming with us but doesn't wanna talk about these things. I said that's strike 3. You're keep rejecting my initiatives to talk. I have nothing else to do. We went to a club with 5 people including us. 2f 3m. I noticed that one of the guys (We never met him before) was keep talking to Jane's ear and she was listening and talking to her. I said okay, that's normal. After awhile I saw that his hands were on her waist and he was behind her. I just looked and observed again her reactions. He wasn't grinding but there were definitely contact. He was holding her waist and they were dancing. Again, right in front of me. I said enough was enough and I left the place without saying a word. She didn't came after me. I blocked her on all social medias because I was honestly done with her. The following day, she made her friends come and speak to me about the blocking. I told them what she did was disrespectful and I won't tolerate that kind of shit. She came a day after. She was holding a present box for me. I didn't invite her to my room but she just barged in. She sat on my bed and told me that she wants to talk. She said that she has nothing to defend herself. She has no excuses. What she did was fucked up and she had no explanation. She apologused profusely but she said that maybe she wasn't relationship material. All of them are her words, she said that maybe she's not able to sustain a healthy relationship and that I did nothing wrong to deserve that kind of behaviour.

She asked to still be friends and also have sex but she can't even able to meet my bare minimum expectations abd blocking her was a very harsh thing to do to her. I mean I knew that she was an egoist person but this is just narcism.  I told her that I'd never be friends with someone who knowingly hurts me. She did that as a power move and knowingly. She said that she didn't do it with the intention of hurting me but she just couldn't get herself to be ""thoughtful and nice.""

I was quite shocked by this response and told her that what I was expecting from her was bare minimum respect and even that was being thoughtful and nice? I asked her to leave my room and never contact me again. She again apologised but said that please don't cut me out of your life. I really love you and care about you. We don't have to be besties like before but let's just be friends. I told her that we have lots of mutual friends and I'll always be civil around them. I'm not hostile towards you but I'll never have conversations beyond greetings with her. She cried and left the room.

So, to conclusion: I know that I did the right thing. I know that she and I were not a good match. I know that she was a rebound relationship but I still see myself missing her. Also, I bare the guilt of ""betraying"" my ex gf. I'm surprised that what keeps me awake at nights are not my ex but Jane. I still think about Jane and still look at the photos we have together. Maybe that amazing sex is clouding my judgements but I can't seem to get over her. It's been 17 days now. I broke up with 2 girls in this past 2  - 3 months. I both have the guilt and the grieve with me.

How can I resolve these feelings? I started hitting the gym. I'm following a good diet and a good gym program but other than that, I'm just going to school and work. I don't wanna be in the same room as Jane so I'm ditching our mutual friends' invites because I know that she'll be there.

I think I should go out more and meet new people and create myself a new friend group but I was in my comfort zone for SO LONG. I have loooong lasting really solid friendships but they are all at my home country. I was domestic for 2+ years. I never had any issues with relationships with woman but I'm kinda rusty and not in the mood I think. But I do know that making some friends both male and female would be good for me.

I'm open to advices and also maybe for some chat?

Thank you for reading.

TL;DR: Me and my gf of 2 years broke up after I moved to Europe for 1 semester. I went into a casual relationship and then a full on relationship with the girl that I told her not to worry about. Which resulted in a disaster. Now, I can't get over the rebound relationship because the sex was amazing and on my relationship with my ex, we didn't engaged in PIV sex because she was willing to wait until marriage. I don't know if I miss this rebound because our body chemistry was extraordinary and the sex was good or did I really catch feelings? Also, It ended bad so I cut contact with her but we still have lots of mutual friends.

I wanna detach myself from them because I don't wanna be in the same room with her. I started hitting the gym. I'm following a good diet and a good gym program but other than that, I'm just going to school and work.

We were friends but didn’t really talk much and I had a boyfriend at the time. 
When I told him my boyfriend cheated and was crying etc he consoled me- and even kissed me. But after that I pushed him away and ignored him at work even, he’d text me but I would ignore the texts. He’s a really quiet guy so I never know what he thinks or even that he was interested. 

I hung out with him again a year later with my friend and his friend but we didn’t actually really talk- but he always texted me and kept in touch even if I ignored him. 

In 2021 we started texting and talked about seeing a movie together and he wanted to get a hotel, and I didn’t know how to feel about it because I was catching feelings. We texted a ton and even swapped pics- but I ended up blocking him for a month because I was just confused because he suddenly went dry- and he’d text my number asking me to unblock him. 
After that we ended up seeing each other and kissed again. I was (19) he was (22)

Well this year we started texting even more and he’s just really sweet? And he asked if he could be my “side boo” and that we could be there for each-other. I agreed, but we never made any like boundaries? Well I never text him first and he texts me like “Goodmorning” “how are you” “wyd” bla bla bla but will also disappear and wont respond for hours. But he is busy too. I think he’s just keeping me “interested” but idk. We meet up I’d say once a week and do the do lol in his car. And we never really talk, we just have sex and that’s it- I even let him record us loool- not long ago I asked him if he wants to go see a movie and he said he was down but it was never brought up again. And  last time we met up he didn’t even bring condoms- and was very talkative with me and told me a bunch of stuff about his life and stories etc etc and I was just caught very off guard. He even played music. (We did end up going to the gas station to get some but idk) he even wanted to stay and talk after the fact and asked if I wanted a milkshake. We didn’t text after that but two days later he texts me that he’s really stressed and feels super numb and I said if he “needs” me I’m here. And he said “just you being sweet is enough” and it’s just very weird and out of character. He’s usually just very quiet and kept to himself, we’ve never really “gotten to know eachother” like that before. I don’t know why he’s tried so hard to stay in my life all these years, he is a VERY attractive man and he’s soft spoken and sweet. he knows a lot of pretty girls too. 
What’s with the sudden change? 
I don’t understand men at all very well. 
Why has he kept up with me all these years?

My wife and I all have mentally ill friends, and we decided a good way to deal with the depression of everything going on was to write suicide notes and bungee jump after reading it. 

Recently my bio dad came back into my life and was in the room when I read mine aloud (I have bad speech anxiety and was practicing funnily enough) and he realized just how bad my life was without him in it. How all of my trauma essentially settled around not having a father figure/protector in my life at all until I hit 23. 

It hit him hard, and I was outside crying with him and we talked for a while but in his own words “that scarred me in a way I don’t think I’ll ever be able to get past, that I left you to go through that alone” 

Tl;dr: Read my suicide note in front of my bio dad who hadn’t been in my life and made him hate himself for not being there.


Edit: Whoever reported me to the Reddit Care bs, I’m fine. I’m not actually going to kill myself. This was more so an off my chest “this is my story, as my last words” idea to deal with the pain and stress of our lives in a therapeutic way (therapist approved of it) and it hasn’t happened yet but I’ll update if the falling sensation helps at all when we do go.

Edit 2: Since people are confused and calling biodad a deadbeat: he was not in my life because he had no idea I existed. My biomom decided to have a one night stand with him and got pregnant despite birth control and condoms being used. He left to go home overseas after his business trip to the States was over. My dad lived all the way across the world in Seoul while I live in the USA, and we reconnected after my aunt, his sister matched with me on a DNA testing site. He isn’t a deadbeat nor did he have any chance of knowing I existed since he never left contact information. The Asshole here is my biomom as it took me doing DNA tests to find my family bc she continued to lie to me and say that I had the same father as my half brothers (who has already compared DNA to me and was a half match maternally) he’s not a deadbeat YALL. He straight up had no idea until my aunt got in contact me.

Edit 3: (a little late but here we go) The assumption is that this is Suicidal Ideation: it is not. Therapist approved for all of us too. For all six of us. Some were apprehensive, but I sent them with letters explaining and my number in case they wanted to triple check what we intended to do. It’s kinda like a release thing. A lot of people are imagining it’s a simulation of suicide and that’s not it at all tbh. What we’re doing is reading our “reasons why”, shredding them, jumping and letting go of them. So we finally get that release. Positive endorphins from the adrenaline after reading your soul to your closest friends about why you feel like you’ve suffered enough and you let go of the negative with a coming influx of positive emotions. 


I would NOT be encouraging my friends to do this if any of them were suicidal, since as many pointed it out, it may make things easier for them. 

Also, for reference, mentally ill people are usually the more awesome ones to me because I can relate to them better. And mentally ill does not equate suicidal. Some friends are just agoraphobic, depressed, have anxiety, etc.  Some are using this as an outlet to face trauma like myself. 


We ARE NOT DOING THIS AS PRACTICE FOR THE BIG JUMP.  And unless you’re a healthcare professional and can prove such with a psych degree, please do jot tell me that this outlet is unhealthy.

2022-07-21 03:49:25,5,True,0,"TL;DR:

I (21 F) started seeing a guy— we’ll call him W (24 M)— that I’ve known for a long time, and I had told him beforehand that I never want to have kids. He said he wanted a relationship with me and we dated for a week. One day, while having sex without protection, he didn’t pull out, he bought me Plan B, then he broke up with me over the phone because he wants kids someday, all before noon that day. We still talk just the same as before and are still friends, and I’m planning on hanging out with him next month. Does it seem like he was using me? Should I ask him??


Now the full story:

W and I first dated in high school, I was a freshman (15yo) he was a senior (18yo). Dated for a week before his parents broke us up because of the age difference. W graduated and went away to another state for military, but we stayed in touch. I started dating another guy and we lasted 5 and a half years, we just broke up last November.

W and I started talking everyday and watched movies together, played video games, had 7+ hour long phonecalls, etc. The topic of kids came up multiple times, and I always said I’d never want them. He didn’t give a direct answer, but he seemed to lean towards not wanting them as well. 

He came to visit last month, and we planned lots of fun stuff to do together. The first day, he made out with me and wanted to have sex. I gave him condoms, but when we tried them, he said he’s never used one before and it kept slipping out, so we ditched them. We continued having unprotected sex throughout that week, he just pulled out. (We’ve both been tested.)

After a week, he said he wanted a real relationship with me, and for me to really think about whether I wanted to go long distance, since he’s military and all. I decided he was worth it, and we were both really happy and excited; we both consider ourselves difficult people to match with, but he said I matched him better than anyone else could. 

Fast forward a week, it’s the day he had to go back home. Had a breakfast date, got handsy in the car, and I decided to pull off into a remote area to have sex. I had condoms on me, but it was routine at that point to not use them. 

Midway, he stopped for a minute and was like ‘oh shit.’ Basically, he said he was pretty sure he didn’t finish yet and it was probably mine, but wasn’t sure. I said we could stop and get Plan B after just in case. We continued, then he asked if he could finish in me, since we were getting Plan B anyways. I said ok, he finished in me, then as I was getting cleaned up, he kept apologizing to me and said he expected better of himself, like really just beat on himself. I wasn’t sure how I felt, but I told him it was ok, shit happens. He bought me Plan B, we went for a walk in a park, then he made his way back to his state.

After leaving, he called me to tell me he wants kids someday and we should end it. He said he didn’t break it off sooner because he “wanted to see if anything could be salvaged.” He said we shouldn’t drag things on, as one of us would eventually have to compromise, and that would lead to resentment. I cried and he did too, assured me it wasn’t anything I did and there was nothing wrong with me, told me to never change for anyone, not even him. 

We’ve since gone back to the same way we were before, watching movies and talking for hours at a time. I booked a flight to visit him next month for a week. 

So my problem is:
Although we’re still friends, I still can’t help but feel like he did me wrong. It really seems like he used me, especially since he had sex with me all those 2 weeks and waited until AFTER he left the state to break up with me over something he already knew.

English isn't my first languages, sorry  
My best friend ""Marc"" (23m) and me (22f) are friends since we're 15. We share the same friend circle so I will tell you guys instead. 
Everyone is always joking around that we're gonna be married someday or just assume we are a couple. He was there for me when my dad died, he visits my mum to talk to her when he is in town, you get it. 

The funny thing is, we both have very specific types, he likes blond, petite, small women and I like.. well, older guys :D I am nothing like the girls he used to date, he is nothing like the guys I dated. 

I'm living with my boyfriend together in another town, and I always told everyone that he is so cool about my friendship with Marc. He just accepted that we are inseparable and thats it. I am so (was??) grateful for that. He trusts me 100 percent. Well. 

This weekend, Marc and I were visiting friends in another city, got drunk af, clubbing and or friends were tired and decided to go home early, no biggie, we were on party's/in Clubs 1000 times together. 

Fast forward way home. Marc starts talking about how horny he is (nothing new, very open with our sexlives) and FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE WE KNOW EACH OTHER my drunken brain was.. I don't know... Interested? 

We got home, straight to the shitty small sofa. Heatwave, so the less clothes, the better. But I had still a huge shirt and a slip on, he boxers. 

Because of this shitty weather, we weren't able to sleep so we chatted for a while until the topic falls back on his horniness. I clearly remember saying ""yeah you do you, I don't mind, have fun!"" And him saying ""well no that's weird haha"" 
Then I laid my arm on his chest and he began to just (I don't now the English word and I'm too tired to look it up. Fingers on arm, slightly moving, you know?). And then we kissed. The problem of being absolutely honest about our sexlives is that he was 100 percent aware of what I like and not. The sex was really really good. 

After that we talked and decided to take this to our grave. Bot directly after the sex and again sober in the morning.  I love my boyfriend like hell and I want to marry him someday. I am 100 percent sure this will never happen again. 
Marc and I were both fine after that, we slept on that sofa the next day again, and nothing happened. We talked like always and there was no tension. 3 hour car drive back home, everything as always. 

I am still pretty confused tho and I am dying to tell my bf, because I tell him everything. But I took the easy, selfish road and will not. Even if he would forgive me, he would want to break up contact with Marc (understandable). I will not do that under any circumstances. 

So yes, I'm feeling like shit, and can't sleep. On the other hand, I'm getting flashbacks from one of the best sex I have ever had.

Now a few years into our friendship at the beginning she moved slightly out of the way.. not crazy far but with neither of us able to drive.. and busy lives, we rarely saw each other in person for the most part, even now.

And she's had an incredibly tough life, I mean her strength is unparalleled. She's been through so much abuse and asshole ex's.. and when I say abuse I mean basically all forms. 
And I know it all, we have absolutely no secrets between us. None. She knows everything about me and we love each other in a way few people ever do.. but our lives never really brought us together..

8 years ago I found my ex fiancée, had a child.. and split up a few years ago. And in that time she also found her husband and got married.  (I'm summing up a long story here)

They split before me and my ex did, and after we finally did a few years .. we actually met up and connected again properly for the first time in years, but she wants to try making her marriage work again.. I was upset but...  the ""taken advantage"" part comes in now.... 

like I said we know everything about each other.. including kinks, fetishes and fantasies.

And she's a mess, she knows that. I don't judge her for it.. or anyone. But her ultimate fantasy is to be awoken in the night to being ""assaulted"". Not just in a way you'd expect.. but she's always included my kink (as you can probably guess from my username)

She loves to beg and plead for someone to stop, but knowing they won't. She's the definition of submissive and it absolutely gets her going.
She visibly gets flustered and very red when she talks about it.. 


And the crazy thing is I think she actually wants me too. She's said so much that she's totally into trying my kinks, and I can't say I haven't thought about us. 

I don't even care she's married tbh. Hell, that's one of the main factors behind why she loves the idea so much..

In the past, I’ve always had to be discreet and quiet during sex due to living with parents/roommates. I didn’t realize until i was with a partner when i was 18 and didn’t have to be quiet, that it had basically trained me to be mute during sex. He pointed it out and I’ve been self conscious about it since then. Flash forward a bit, and I just got out of a 3 year long relationship with a different partner. With him, i was super comfortable so i never really thought about it again. He also didn’t give me head but maybe 5 times, so most of the time we were having sex i would be kissing him. Now that I’m out of that relationship and having sex with new people, the self consciousness when a man goes down on me has returned. I have always just thought I don’t like getting head, but i think it’s that I’m in my head (haha) so much that i can’t enjoy it.

A few weeks back on August 1 I had a widowmaker heart attack. I am only 34.  My life has changed drastically since it happened. Ive formed a fear of food and have barely eaten besides what my husband forces me to and even then its bately more than a few bites.  My hair is falling out due to all the medications im on. I am just so tired and drained. I have been out of work and went back before my doctor wanted me to because without my income we are drowning fast. My depression hit an all time low on tuesday night when i was expecting the little bit of pay i shouls have gotten. 

I went back to work at the end of a pay cycle and should have gotten 2 days in this check. Silly me forgot about my benefits coming out and my net ended up being 0. They took everything. We have nothing to grocery shop for 3 more weeks. My kids start school (4th and K) next week and we dont have school clothes. I have bills due and my state doesnt have any options for people in my situation because at the time i got a paycheck ""within the last 30 days"". 
So when my pay didnt come in and i saw my paystub say ""0"", i lost it. I was useless now. I cant even provide for my children. And I went to the dark place. 

So after my kids went to bed I started writing letters for my children to open years from now. I had a plan. I knew when, where, and how I was going to do it. I went to bed trying so hard not to cry. Planning to get a few more days in at work so they would at least have some money in a few weeks when this pay period ends. My 9 year old woke up and came into my room. He said he had a feeling wake him to to come hug me and his words were ""Ill never leave you, mommy. I love you"". How can I respond to that?? My 9 year old promising to never leave me and here I am planning to do that to them? 

I have a traumatizing history with therapy and ive been reluctant to go. But just those little words from my child makes me want to. I hate these feelings. Ive never been depressed or had these thoughts until this heart attack happened. And struggling this bad right now with getting my kids what they need isnt helping at all. Ive reached out to family, friends, called 211, applied and applied and applied everytlwhere and got nothing but ""No"". 

Im not even sure what Im expecting by posting this. I think just getting it off my chest and out there into the universe might help. If you made it this far, thank you and I appreciate you.

We’ve done pretty much everything together over the past couple weeks. We ate most meals together, if I was hanging out with any of my friends I’d ask him to come with and vice versa, we did homework in the same room, we’d study together, etc. 

Last Friday we threw a very small party in our dorm (15-20 people) and we were all over each other all night (holding hands, I played with his hair, he vaped in my mouth).

We kissed a couple times over the course of the night, then when our friends left, he asked me to sleep in his bed. I think we can guess where it went from there.

When i was 18 and i was in university i had a lecturer who’s best friend was his co lecturer. Bit of a weird set up i know, just know that it was an automotive course that i took. Anyway the co lecturer (who was 45 at the time) and i (let’s call him B) really hit it off. I was the only female in the class and i was the youngest in the class. 

B and i used to talk a lot in class and he used to make a lot of comments about how i was his favourite student and used to give me special treatment and praise me a lot. I don’t know how no one else noticed or maybe they did and just turned a blind eye to it. Anyway one day B said that we should meet outside of class so me being a dumb girl who recently “became an adult” i jumped on the opportunity. We met at a secluded location and well the rest is history. After that day we decided to meet up again, and then once more at my house - this was about 2 months after i graduated so we hadn’t seen each other in a while.

When he arrived at my house he seemed very off, almost like he had something on his mind which i wasn’t really mature enough to deal with at the time so i acted like normal. We tried to fool around but he had problems getting it up and he just decided to get dressed and leave. It was pretty strange to me but i didn’t think too much of it. 

We didn’t talk after that, i didn’t hear from him for about a year when out of the blue he text me asking how i was. Me being a dumb 19 year old i didn’t think anything was up with that so i just replied talking about myself and how good i was and then i asked how he was and i never got a reply. 

About a year after that i got a job working at a local garage. By this time i was 20. I had the lecturer (let’s call him D) that did our welding class come in as a customer and we chatted about how things were etc. I then asked about B and he informed me that B passed away a year prior. I was blown away. I asked what happened and was told that he committed suicide. I was even more blown away. When i asked why he said no one knew. 

I went home and did some digging and found his obituary post from the funeral home where he lived and it said he left behind a wife and 3 kids. He had his own business and 2 dogs that he loved dearly. He used to frequent classic car shows as he had 2 classic cars that were his pride and joy. I destroyed this man’s life. 

I am only assuming that the guilt of cheating on his wife ate him up. He text me out of the blue and i thought nothing of it.

She had a lot of mental illnesses like BPD, Bi-polar depression, and ptsd. I thought I could handle it all. She was extremely suicidal, i went to bed a lot of nights sobbing. Not just because i was scared, but because of the things she would do or say, and the slow realization that i didn’t love her, even though i planned my life around her.

She was jealous of all of my lets say “female friends”, especially my best friend (who i did have a relationship with in the past). I understood her jealousy, but she always crossed the line. Insulting her looks, her personality, everything about her (even though they weren’t true). Our relationship got so bad that she started using her self harming and suicidal thoughts against me after i broke up with her. Whenever i would ask why she hated my friends so much we would just fight, and then she would compare to her ex (WHO FUCKING RAPED HER). She would just sit there and ignore whatever i was saying and say his name over and over again.

Anyways i could go on for days about everything that happened with her. The point is, that was my first long term relationship with someone that i wasn’t friends with previously. And now im shit terrified that no matter who i get with that itll just be the same. Every time i see a cute girl, i just get so much anxiety and remember everything my ex said to me.

He says it’s because he’s stressed about things but I feel like I am the problem. I feel like we connect on an emotional level but he perhaps isn’t that sexually attracted to me.

He was my first and I am not his so I’d say he is more sexually experienced than me. I’ve tried asking him for advice on how to make things feel better for him and nothing works. If it’s a HJ or a BJ he’s just limp. This has happened so many times and I used to get visibly upset by it until he had a go at me for “making it worse.” He now says that when it goes down it’s because it’s my fault as I am being negative about the situation. As a supportive girlfriend I have taken this on board (even if I don’t agree with what he is saying) and am now even more supportive and try other techniques - like waiting a bit, changing positions, using toys etc. nothing seems to work 

It really makes me question myself, I feel incredibly insecure and on top of it I feel like I can’t voice my emotions to him about the situation because it’ll be me making matters worse. It’s now gotten to the point where I dread doing anything sexual with him as I know how it’ll end.

This has been on my mind on and off since it happened and I really need to know if this is okay/ normal for siblings.

My brother growing up was a very aggressive person, both in how he played with my brothers and I (hide and seek, the usual scaring the shit out of your siblings, etc.) and was a permanent baby sitter until he moved out. He’s almost a decade older than me. 

When I was just starting puberty (I’m AFAB, so born female) my brother was chasing me around the house. We did this, usually I ran out of fear from what I can remember. But I was in the living room, and he took off my shirt, which caused me to run into the kitchen and cover myself with a mat. I was balling my eyes out, and my younger brother got me a towel.

I have always struggled with my mental health in 2018 I was diagnosed with Depression, Anxiety, ADHD, OCD, insomnia, PTSD, hypersensitivity, and I feel like I’m missing some. In 2019 the seizures started and now Im starting to believe I have autism. Now to the point. In 2011-2012 (Basketball Season) we met him I’ll call him E he was already a highschool graduate and became two of my brothers basketball coach S and H over the years E became best friends with my brothers until slowly S back away and went to college. Fast forward E would always only hug me if I was sitting down so he could rest his face in my boobs or if we were standing pull my hips into his. this started when I was 11/12 when I was 19 he was in his mid twenties and one night he came over to my house to “comfort me” after a falling out with a friend. He didn’t rape me but he did assault me. When I told my family everyone called me a liar because he was a pastor he would never do that. He was practically a brother to me and my brothers and a son to my parents. Covid hit and even though I still lived with my brothers I went no contact. I did go to the police but they did nothing I went to the church and found out I was the 5th person to complain. As of today there’s about 12 victims. I am the only one to speak up. Back in 2021 I started talking to my brothers again all but my little brother we will call R he still hung out with E even though I begged him to not to. When I asked for help from my friends they called me a liar and chose to stay friends with him. H later apologized to me and said all my friends wanted to apologize to me.They never did. Growing up I was closest to H but now we will never talk again. He got married last month his groomsmen were the boys who called me a liar. You see I have a really bad seizure disorder I’ve seen several specialists and no one can diagnose me. I knew if I saw my brothers groomsmen I’d seize and possibly die my seizures can last up to 20 minutes. I called H and told him and can’t come he got upset because apparently he really wanted me to be there. I asked him to choose. And H did he just didn’t choose me. I missed the wedding.

One thing I've had an issue with that I didn't know about until this June was that he still follows and occasionally interacts with old crushes and hookups/gfs on FB. One of these girls he's liked for years and still likes her pictures or sexual memes she posts and whatnot. I confronted him about it and he said that it didn't mean anything because she's a lesbian (sexual memes like basically her asking who wants to fuck her in meme format and him replying 'me'). Anyway, whenever we go a few days without sex he'll start watching porn or looking at her (or other girls pictures). 

Last night I knew he was horny, but I fell asleep because he got home late and I saw today that he interacted with pictures of a really fit girl and the girl I mentioned before. Or there have been other times when I say I'm not horny and he watches porn (he knows I'm really against porn too). There have also been instances where he's horny and drunk and he's contacted old hookups on FB and tried to talk to them. 

I know he's free to do what he wants, but whenever I reject sex, I feel guilty, and I know he's going to find another way to get off. It just makes me feel like I'm a fleshlight and he only sees sex as a way to get off not as a loving act. 

I guess I just needed somewhere to vent. I've tried to talk about it with him and he just says I'm crazy or it's not a big deal. Sorry im a messy writer btw.

My partners past sexual experiences have never bothered me, aside from one because it was with a client of his that who still uses the services they met through which requires him to see her every so often. She’s much older than me and very wealthy, he’s made sure to mention how beautiful her home/bedroom were, so it’s difficult for me to grapple with that one. Other than that, nothing he’s ever told me has made me feel insecure or jealous. But recently when I bring up things I may want to do in the bedroom, he immediately responds with “Oh, I’ve done that before. It’s pretty good so we can do it if you want to.” And it’s bothering me. A LOT.

Now, I get it, it’s natural to relate certain things to past experiences and I’m not upset about that. What’s upsetting is that in the moment I am thinking about us and how much fun something could be, and he immediately shows me that he’s thinking about how much fun he’s already had, and it makes me feel like my suggestions just aren’t very exciting. Like this morning, I was talking about installing a pole when we move as I’ve taken pole dancing classes in the past and find it to be fun. He immediately said “I mean, it wouldn’t be the first time Ive seen it at all, but go for it if you want to.” Like??? Was that necessary??? Especially considering I have previously heard every detail of the experience he was referring to??? It’s just really dampening any excitement I could possibly have. 

How do I bring this up to him without making him feel attacked, or like I’m just jealous? The truth is that I’m glad he had experiences before me, I just don’t want to have to hear about them when we’re supposed to be focused on us.

I pursued 3 people and maybe about 5 pursued me. I've had two relationships before that, 6 months (age 18) and 1 year (19-20)

I don't know if 8 potential people since then is a lot or a little. Of course I've tried meeting people on dating sites but I'm not counting those. 

Am I chasing a fairy tail? Is ""falling in love"" more of a conscious decision rather than magical feeling that sweeps you away? I know there's a honeymoon phase at the beginning of relationships but idk if after that the romantic feelings literally disappear and then you make a decision to stay or what. 

I see some people go from partner to partner and I wonder how that wonderful coincidence can happen over and over for some but has never happened for me. 

Also, what's the deal with ""settling""? Either you're in love or your not and you don't get a choice. So if you're ""settling"" to me that sounds like giving up on love and going for an arrangement (which is fine if that's what both people want).

Thing is, I tried this idea of being with someone because I decided to, not because I was compelled to by romantic feelings, and I just wasn't into it.

So it appeared out of nowhere like he’d downloaded it from somewhere else. I know this because I could tell the background wasn’t the same as where he lived currently but recognized one of his blankets. I know going thru his phone was wrong but I had caught him in various other lies previously. Even found out he asked his ex gf if he could spend the night one night.

We are beyond the point of negotiation. The rights you all want arent going to be given to you. Youre going to have to take them. 

The punishment and consequences for defying everything currently in place are only effective when enough people are scared of them, or even better, convinced they are necessary altogether. When it comes down to a situation of enforcing unjust laws in place to protect the systems very existence, punishing the masses who challenge or defy it becomes impossible. 

That is what they dont want people to know, what they dont want people to realize. The power held by the many isnt dangerous until they become aware of how they can change it all by just not following the rules and playing the game. Just look at what something as simple as staying home has done.

They sent everyone home and closed businesses deemed not essential during the pandemic for public safety, then had to admit that  the economy relies on our labor, entirely. We cant go back to the way things were before and they cant capitalize on our labor for record profits unless we all go back to work... interesting. 

What if we dont want to go back to the way things were before? Then we need to acknowledge histories ugly truth about these kinds of movements. What has worked before isnt going to be enough. Its going to take more. 

If everyone instead of boycotting massive corporations, just decided to steal what they needed from them instead, the justice system would not be able to handle it. A corporate entity being the victim of hundreds of thousands of crimes would only lose even more money pursuing criminal proceedings against everyone. The courts would be overrun with so many cases they could never take everyone to trial. There arent enough jails to even put everyone in. 

If instead of wasting time rallying and marching and campaigning and then voting every 2-4 years for change, we all decided NOT to vote at all. Elected officals wouldnt be able to say they represent the ""people"", let alone a majority. They wouldnt be able to disguise their decisions anymore as anything other than what it is, to enrich themselves and their circles. Disgustingly enough, voter participation is incredibly misrepresented already and on top of that a large percentage of the population cant even vote. Yet we are sold the idea our vote matters. 

If EVERY ONE OF US instead decided to not file our taxes or pay our rent, or stopped making our credit card payments, or decided to withdraw our money from banks, the entire economic system would be exposed for what it is... Fragile and completely dependent on exploiting all of us. 

Historically, the rich and governments world wide have answered any real threat to their power with a heavy hand. I have no doubt they will this time around as well. But making examples of a few hundred or a few thousand has only been good enough up until now. How far could they actually take it? They already use violence in enforcement of victimless crimes. But they cant kill everyone. They cant arrest everyone. They CANT punish everyone. They cant organize retaliation against EVERYONE. 

Their hand was officially tipped recently, now we see they lie openly about anything they want and tell you everything they do is for your own good. 

Politics are now exposed offically as just a trap used to ensure nothing actually changes. There isnt a left or right. Theres only the HAVES and have nots. 

Notice how theres nothing wrong with anything unless they have decided there is? How there arent solutions to problems unless its their solutions being presented? We have to stop playing their game and thinking that we can change anything using the systems theyve put in place. 

Hopefully more people realize this.

Yeah, the truth is scary, but we need to get enough people to act on this. 

Engaging in activites that not just go against the establishment, but are even criminal under current law, are eventually going to be necessary in order to undermine their system.

1. We’ve only been official for a few days, but we’ve been talking for well over a month. 
2. I’m asexual and I have had bad experiences with sexual stuff in the past so I have bad anxiety about it. I’m still willing to do stuff for my partner but there’s a lot of anxiety surrounding it, and it’s hard for me to even do the simplest of things without feeling pretty anxious with it. 
So throughout the talking period with my (now) bf, I asked on multiple occasions what his kinks were or what he likes. He’s a virgin so his answers were pretty basic and limited to “well I’d LIKE to try this” and it was all pretty vanilla stuff. But it opened up the opportunity to see if we were kind of compatible in that sense. 
Today we were gaming and somehow piss kinks came up (idk how) and he goes quiet as I joke about how weird it is. And then I ask him, and he says he does have a small piss kink. I tried to just move past it but my thoughts kind of spiraled and I think he could tell I was upset. He assured me we wouldn’t have to do anything surrounding that, etc. but there’s just kind of that dark cloud over my head now. Like, no matter what I do, or how much I try to ignore it I’ll just be AWARE of it. 
But I’m upset for a few reasons. 
1. I find it gross. Props to whoever likes it and finds someone who is willing to do it with them but I think it is absolutely repulsive and it makes me gag just thinking about it. 
2. Because of the anxiety of feeling like I have to please my partner to keep them happy, but not really being comfortable with it because I’m asexual and have had bad experiences I’m kind of trapped in a “he said I don’t have to, but then he’ll hate me if I don’t. So I have to do it to please him, but It’s gross” 
3. There’s honestly a pretty high chance if I knew this before we got together, I wouldn’t have started dating him at all. 
I guess in short, idk how to go about this. Because the relationship is new enough. Do I end it? Do I just try to ignore it? Do I try it and see if he discovers he doesn’t like it? But what if he does??

2022-01-22 18:31:09,5,True,41,"First of all, I need to say that I am still SO GLAD that I left. I think that as I update, you’ll see why… 

Links to my previous posts at the bottom, as always:)

I think things could be going a lot worse, but also I’m having some serious issues here. 
My ex is still in our appartement (2bdrm). We have a 1-year lease that’s up in March, but he’s decided that he’ll move out in February. My grandma lives ten minutes away, so I’m spending most of my time in her spare room, including most nights. But I don’t really want to say I’ve “moved out” in case he decides to come after me legally. I’m afraid it would be bad for my side if I “leave” first. 

For the first few days of our separation, he was nice. He wanted to grab burgers together and talk about how things are going to go. We agreed we wanted to stay peaceful and in occasional contact. He said he’s sorry he hurt me, but he understands why we need to separate. 

I think he was lying because two nights later he wanted to call me. He said he wanted to “talk about things” so I said he could call me if he wanted, but reminded him that we have a planned day to talk through our separation and assets and everything. So I didn’t really want to talk about any of that until then. 

Turns out it was an interrogation. I mentioned it in my last post, saying he asked if I had meant our vows. 
And I said: “uh… yeah. I wrote them, or don’t you remember?”

Sidetrack : 
I have a video of that, actually. We were sitting in my car, and we were going to write our vows together. He played Clash Royale, ignored me when I read them and asked how they sounded, then read them in a really obnoxious way. It’s literally on camera because I was trying to record what I wanted to be a special moment. I was pissed, and he apologized and tried to make it up to me. But I’m hindsight… I feel like that story adds some context. 

It’s hard to share stories about our early relationship, because I think at that time I had no idea what love looked like. Or a healthy relationship. I’d never been treated particularly well by any role models in my life. My heart hurts because I can’t blame 17 year old me for wanting a stable relationship where if I got hurt, at least he apologized. Like the bar was so low. And if I met him now, I don’t think I would’ve talked to him for more than five minutes. It sucks to say, but it’s honestly true. I don’t hate him but I don’t like him at all anymore. I just want this nightmare to be over. 

Ok back on track :
Yesterday I came back to split up some of our belongings. He’s been staying in our apartment but I want to be there while he packs things to make sure he doesn’t take my shit. So last night was awful. He tried to take a bunch of my collection books. He took my beanbag chair and coffee table and one of my bookshelves. For every thing I want to keep, he needs to know what “he gets for it”. I called him out on the complete 180: he went from wanting to stay close to me and all understanding to demanding and cold and rude. He asked why I was saying this. Why did it matter, we’re not married anymore. I guess I just couldn’t believe what I was hearing. It’s like the last few years don’t even matter. The apology that he claimed was so sincere last week, he laughs when I ask about it now. He’s mad because he thinks that he deserved for me to stay, because he thinks he’s put in the work in the last month.

Here’s the truth about the last month that we were together: he complained about work constantly. Milked his days off for covid and lost even more pay then I did. Saw a counsellor twice and is convinced they figured out all his problems. Ignored the mental health crisis that I’ve been in (literally reaching out to family and friends and doctors for help because I recalled a depressed childhood memory of sexual abuse. This started in October). He barely even checked on how I was doing with that, and did absolutely nothing to help. 

When I told him the memory had created new triggers for me around sex (literally just, please don’t hold my legs down) he proceeded to do exactly that the next two times he tried to have sex with me. It sent me into a panic attack for real, and I had to stop. There was one more time he tried to have sex with me, and I actually just felt so tense and scared that I stopped him and said I didn’t feel like it. I was scared of getting triggered again. And that’s the end of that, because I kicked him out of my bed a few days later.

I really hope that one day he looks back on this and regrets what he did. You’d think that, since I’m splitting up with him for how bad he hurt me, he’d try not to do it anymore. But I think part of him is enjoying punishing me for leaving. He ignored my needs, acted like an entitled asshole, triggered and abused me, and now he’s mad because “I was supposed to stay forever”. It’s crazy how much I now dislike someone that I used to think I would love forever. 

Financial abuse update :
Because you asked!
The reason it took like a month for us to separate was because I was getting my finances in order. I had to take my time because I didn’t want to alarm him. A lot of Redditors warned me to do this, and I agreed that I needed to be careful about how I handled separating our finances. 
But I’m a wizard, and he was happy to hand me all the information because I’m “getting my life together for the new year”. I got all the passwords to our accounts, and told him how it was going to be moving forward - I’ll pay my bills. We’ll split mutual bills 50/50. That’s the way it should have been the whole time. 
There were also two bills that had overdue charges from the last period (totalling around $100!!). And I made him pay that HIMSELF. 

We had Covid over the holidays so that was a setback lol (I’m fine. Worst cold/flu I ever had, but it’s not like I almost died. Get vaxxed if u can guys - for all I know that’s what kept me out of the ICU).

Then I really had to focus on work for a week, to catch up and have my performance review. I got a raise, but it’s actually been very hard at work. I’m being all but denied a promotion, blatantly because I’m a woman. It’s a complicated situation. But I think I’m going to be leaving another relationship soon - and hopefully find a new company to work for. 

Finally, I went to see my parents and my siblings (I have three sisters who I am really close to). I told them about what was happening (they knew some of it, but I hadn’t told them I was going to leave him). It’s hard for them because they love me, and because they’re hardcore Christians. Divorce is a difficult thing to accept. But they all support me, and have my back 100%. My whole family has my back so far. 

So I feel safe, I feel sure of my decision. I’m scared a lot though. And it’s been really hard splitting our stuff up and he’s literally trying to take my fucking book collection. But I’m strong af and he’s a pussy who - in his own words - wouldn’t have even fought cancer if it wasn’t for ME. 

Plus i have Reddit, where I just got a bunch of new followers and people who are giving kind words, advice, sharing their stories. Guys, this is amazing. Someone who gave me an award my last post (UMM IVE HARDLY GOTTEN AN AWARD ANYTHING EVER???thank you all???) also said that my story helped them learn some thing in their relationship. I was raised religious and I’m not anymore, but because of it I just see community as MAGICAL. I’m eternally grateful, even to that one asshole that I was trolling on my last post bc he was pretty funny and I need reasons to laugh these days. 

I’m going to keep updating! At this point, I feel like I don’t really care if someone who knows me finds this. I’m sure they have their own reasons that they’re on Reddit looking for relationship advice. Let’s connect, hmu. I’m being real here and it’s part of getting free.

WARNING LONG

Background: We have been together for 3 years, and we have discussed marriage. We were planning on moving in together. We have had smaller arguments or issues prior to this, but nothing even close to this scale. Hence my desire to get non-biased advice. 

Issue: My partner, myself, my best friend and her partner went out drinking. My partner got the most intoxicated (not an issue just included for context). He tends to get clingy while that messed up, and I was basically sober so I wanted space. He followed me into the bathroom, and I snapped at him to leave me alone. I closed the door in his face, and I heard him call me a b-word. I took a shower. When I got out our friends had left, so I went to bed. 

The next day my friend wanted to talk to me. Apparently, he had followed them out to their car and proceeded to tell her things like “you can’t dress that cute, only my partner can” and “I want to f*** you”. They were obviously like tf and left. I felt extremely confused and hurt because this is the first time anything like this has ever happened. It is very very abnormal for him. I confronted him. He claims he cannot remember anything, but he did take responsibility for it. We end up meeting the next day to talk. At that time my theory consisted of his declining mental health. I thought maybe he was trying to ruin his life because he felt he didn’t deserve it. We cried a lot. He apologized. I felt better. 

More recently, the four of us had a conversation about the incident. Immediately, he jumps into apologizing and explaining how he’s in a really bad place. Our friends ask some questions. Then ask me how I’m feeling. This triggers an anxiety attack for me. I end up having to step outside with my friend to cry and compose myself. At the time I felt like I just needed time to build trust with him again. That night he was extremely sad and I consoled him and reassured him that he’s a good person and I love him. 

My friend and her partner did not feel great about the conversation. She pointed out that his response to her Q, would you actually sleep with someone else if they said yes, was that a coworker tried to sleep with him recently but he said no he has a gf, so no he would never. I didn’t know about that coworker incident until that moment. Which, in hindsight, does hurt my feelings because I always make sure to tell him when I get hit on. Another point she made was that he really framed himself as the victim. He was very sad and talked about how horrible his actions were, but failed to fully recognize that we were the ones hurt by his actions. Finally, the fact that I had an anxiety attack when asked how I am feeling. She was concerned that he hadn’t been checking on me. I hadn’t considered that until she brought it up. It does seem kinda sad. 

I really wanted everything to work out, so I don’t think I considered these factors in the moment. Now I feel very confused and conflicted. I just don’t know if this relationship can work. Any advice or insight on how to move forward would be greatly appreciated.

Last night, I was eating Canes (chicken fingers and french fries) in my room while watching a movie with my SO. 

After the movie, I threw the rest of the food away into the trash can in my room (just a few french fries and crumbs from the chicken) and went to bed.

This morning, I brought a trashbag into my room and emptied the contents of my trashcan into it (including the remaining food from the night before). I put the bag next to my door as I intended to take it out the next time I was to go downstairs. However, I forgot to do this.

Now here's where things get... fucked.

After coming home from running errands, I came into my room only to notice that my 170lb English Bull Mastiff had completely torn apart the trashbag that I had left. The cardboard container of food was ripped to shreds and there was sauce all over my carpet.

Now, that would be all well and good (albeit annoying) if it weren't for one item that was missing from the pile of exposed trash that was now sitting on my floor.

""What is this missing item?"" you think to yourself; starting to believe that this story was a waste of time to read.

My dog ate my used condom. Yep. It's fucking gone. Dusted.

I have no idea what to do. Should I be concerned about her digesting it? Will I have to take my dog to the vet, only to have a fucking nut-filled dick balloon extracted? Should I just camp out and wait until she shits so that I hopefully can catch it before the rest of my family has realized what's happened?

Hey everyone,  

My(27M) GF(28 F)  has a creepy guy friend that confesses his love to her on a annual basis. My GF is a absolute sweet heart and tends to be too nice in these situations and it’s painfully obvious that this guy is a fake “nice guy” patiently waiting his turn. I have no hate for the man, its just the game, totally understand and my GF is amazing so I get how anyone could fall in love with her. GF has tried to establish boundaries but he is a little dorky and cant get the picture.

But game recognizes game and I am a pro at this shit:

Last week he bought her a cute heart pendant necklace. So the next time we were having sex, I pulled out and came all over the pendant part of the necklace, took a photo with no identification of the GF and happened to “accidentally” show him while explaining a story and showing him another photo on my phone. He hasn’t contacted my GF for awhile now.

Any feedback on this would be appreciated

\- Got together after knowing each other for 2 weeks out of convenience

\- Had sex like, just one week in (i also lost my v card to him so I regret that)

\- It was like taking care of a child, his spending habits were awful. 

\- At one point he asked to borrow a thousands dollars from me, I was 17. I didn't give in and left him because of that. 

\- I realised that I actually didn't want to spend time with him, but was just coming up with excuses saying I had to work and so on.

I (very early 20s, F) live with my two siblings, my father (early 60s, M), his wife (early 40s), and her child. My parents have been divorced for a while. They got together when I was born, stayed because my youngest sibling was conceived, and split because the relationship was toxic. Among other details, they met for the first time when my mom was in her early teens. 

My youngest sibling is away right now. They are pretty far, so we can only call them, and there are specific times). My dad walks in to my room with his phone, and tells me my youngest sibling is on the line waiting to talk. I pick up the phone, we chat, i hang up. 

When I hang up, the screen opens to some anymous chat app. Pit in my stomach already. I look (I don't even have to scroll) at the messages. He's talking very very sexually to some lady. Doesn't matter who it is. This woman...she's describing a sexual assault encounter but in a very,for lack of better words, horny way. Already bad enough, he's cheating, something he supposedly did to my mom but I never SAW it. Also, it's gross to see your dad talk like that. 

It gets worse. This lady, she's describing something that happened to her when she was 13. She's describing something with her dad's friend. He says that ""that's a good age for that"" and the lady goes on to talk about another sexual experience with an adult as a minor. He says some other horny shit I don't catch because I'm already shaking. 

He knows that I was sexually assaulted when I was around that age. He KNOWS. I told him. I'm so disgusted. I mean I knew he met my mom young and my mom's said they had relations when she was young but holy shit. 

I don't know what to do. I didn't look for worse or more, I don't think I could handle seeing it. I just shut the phone off. When he came /o grab it I didn't say anything. Last year we had the cops come bc of a anonymous tip there was cp downloaded by him. They didn't find anything but now I'm worried that's because he hid it. I'm freaking out.

I'm the only one that knows. My instincts are telling me to run but i have no job, no car, no license. I need to tell his wife, right? How do I do that? Shes the one who's name is on the house. If she leaves (she should) we have no where to go.

I have a feeling I should call the cops but he's been paying for my school. What if they don't find anything and he gets really mad at me. He used to get really mad and get in my face. What if they do find something and I lose everything? My mom is poor. I have a pet I can't leave behind. I don't have anywhere to go. 

My sibling is young. My stepsibling is young. I was young. I can't remember being that age and now it freaking me out. Are they safe? If I do manage to leave I can't bring them with me. I cant afford it. I've been taking care of my younger sibling my whole life but he's paid for everything, at least.

2022-05-15 01:11:23,29,True,1,"Hi, I don’t know how to start this but my(19F) bf(21M) looks at porn while we have sex. Actually he just likes to look at any other girl but me? It’s something that’s confused me for a long time. 

Some background: I used to be really insecure and when my bf would like a girls pic on social media, or check out another girl in public, I’d cry or get angry and I realized it was really toxic behaviour and despite all that, he still wanted to be with me. My insecurities don’t get expressed in that way anymore and liking a picture on Instagram is no big deal. I was just really young and insecure. 

Fast forward 3 years, my boyfriend watches porn EVERYTIME we have sex. He can’t even look at me when we start. I go down to suck his dick and when I look up, all I can see is his phone in his face and he watches porn or looks at only fans and Reddit nudes until we’re done. 

I have a very high libido and I’m typically the one that likes to initiate sex but whenever I see the phone come out, my sex drive is like non existent. He notices when I’m not performing as well but I honestly just can’t fake being okay with it and then give him an amazing blowjob. I’ve brought it up a couple time before that I don’t like when he does this but he just brushes it off or tells me to watch with him. Hard pass. I don’t want to look at all the women he finds attractive, I’m pretty sure it will only make me feel worse.  

I’ve been feeling really down for a few months and it’s really disheartening when he shows me a pic of a woman on his phone and tells me to try to look like her. Maybe he thinks if I do my makeup different then I’ll magically turn into the hot girls in his phone but that’s simply not going to happen naturally. I try so hard to look better for him everyday but it’s no use. I’ll do my hair super pretty and then put on a cute outfit with some nice makeup and I’ll feel good about myself. I initiate sex and boom, the phone is out. There’s no point in trying to look good for him because it’s never enough anyways. 

I don’t know what to do to fix this. I love my bf a lot so I want to be able to work through this. Do I bring it up to him again? But how? Is this something I should work on myself?",NoStupidQuestions,My bf watches porn while we have sex. What do I do?,15.0,2022-05-15
2022-05-15 20:16:44,1,True,2,"In April 2021, I (21f at the time) broke up with my son's father(23m at the time) because he was gaslighting me (i even had proof through text messages but he continued to tell me that i was still wrong), told me he was using me to get what he needed and tried to convince me that I was a narcissist.

Two months after all that i decided to hang out with a coworker that id known for about 6 months. We were flirting and things started to get handsy. He wanted to have sex and I changed my mind and told him i didn't want to do anything. He forced himself on to me. Long story short, i was raped. Whatever, still processing it.

I ended up having a mental break down, had to go to the hospital. I had to start extensive therapy, and was trying to attend an outpatient program. Needless to say, this was a shitty time.

In order to attened the outpatient prgram, I needed assistance with childcare because i am my son's primary caretaker. I dont make enough money on my own to pay for cahildcare. I tried to explain the situation as vague as possible to my son's father, and he told me we wouldn't help me unless I told him. So I did. He said sorry that happened to me and that was that.

Unitl the next morning where he sent me a huge text message about how it was my fault and I was selfish for not thinking of him and letting that happen to me. We got into a huge argument and I told him that I was held down, it's not like I asked him to do that to me. I asked him to never bring it up again.

Lately, he's just been bringing it up unprovoked. Last time he told me that I allowed it to happen and that I dont care about him because of I did then I wouldn't have put myself in that position to begin with. I tell him that it has nothing to do with him, he wasn't there and it's not cool to just bring it up when he wants to. If I wanted to talk about it, I would bring it up. But I don't because I know he's just going to blame me. He says he should be allowed to talk about it because he cares about me and he just wants me to stay out if those situations. He says ""i should be allowed to talk about my feelings about it. But I guess not..""

Today, he told me that if I was really upset about it and didn't want him to talk about itthe last time he brought it up I would have cut him off and told him not to. 

I cant take it. I get so fucking angry about it because I don't need a constant reminder. But he just doesn't get it. If I yell, I'm doing too much. If I cry, he apologizes for making me cry but continues to bring it up. It makes me so fucking mad. I know I'm not being unreasonable.

2022-05-15 20:17:10,33,True,0,"So. Lot of backstory. 

Last September my husband was charged with assault and uttering threats after a particularly nasty fight. My parents called the police after I called them in tears. At the time we’d been together over ten years, half legally married, and we have two children aged 3 and 8. 

Following this charge he was ordered out of the home and placed under an order to have no direct or indirect contact with me. Important to note here that I had no say in the charges or conditions he was placed under - I tried to have everything dropped but was told I had no legal power to do so. He went to live with his parents two + hours away. I allowed him to have the kids there as I was working full time and he was unemployed at the time. I or my elderly parents who live relatively close to where he is have been driving back and forth so I can see the kids on weekends etc. At the time I allowed them to go there I was assuming this would be cleared up relatively quickly however it is now over eight months later with no end in sight. In that time he has gotten a full time jobs and kids are typically in care of his mother which I’m not thrilled about but that’s another story. 

For the first I’d say five months or so after his arrest I reached out to him over and over again trying to get a sense of what he wanted with the relationship. Almost zero response from him - using the excuse of the no contact order. However, and this is a huge however in my opinion, he was fine breaking the order to tell me things he wanted out of the house and making demands about the kids. I went through hell emotionally and came out the other side much stronger. 

After six months of virtually being ghosted except for demands from him, including refusing to allow me having the kids for Christmas when it fell on a weekend and therefore one of my few days off, I made the incredibly difficult decision to tell him I was done. About a month after that I slept with someone else from a dating app because I was lonely, horny, and wanted to see what it would be like to get myself back out there again. 

There were a lot of problems in our relationship and I blame both of us for its downfall. I have adhd which was undiagnosed at the time and some other mental health issues and I know I screwed up a lot. I have apologized to him for all this multiple times. This was not the first incidence of him getting physical in a fight it had been happening off and on for a few years. He was also very frequently verbally abusive towards me, often in front of our kids. Lazy, useless, stupid, b*!ch, c*nt, are all examples. Until very recently I had heard little apology or accountability from him for his failings. 

Now, suddenly, he is messaging me saying he wants to get back together. He wants me to commit to not sleeping with anyone else or pursuing any other relationships until things are sorted out. He is still under no contact order and has done nothing to try and change that and refused a plea deal according to my contact with the court system. I was told by several people he was the one who could file for a variance in his conditions but again my contact says he did not. He says he refused to take a plea because I left him and “cheated” on him. I didn’t admit to sleeping with someone else until after the deal was rejected. He says he just knew but either he assumed and happened to be correct or he was/is spying on me in some way. 

So last week he started with this getting back together thing. I told him I wasn’t ready to make any commitments to him yet about anything. I did say I was willing to at least see where things went with us. Now he’s saying he’s going to divorce me because I won’t commit to the above. Says I want to fuck around. Where we are from you cannot get a divorce until either one year living separately has passed, or there is cruelty or infidelity. I said I wanted to see if it was possible for our relationship to change and be healthy. He said if no commitment to not sleep with others then immediate divorce. I said if he files for divorce that’s it I am done for sure and no more chances.

So uh, I know this guy, and he’s really nice to me, BUT, in general he really isn’t nice at all. I’ve witnessed him being rude to some other guys we hang out with, he often has thinly veiled insults to throw at people in our friend group for no reason.. I thought it was all friendly banter, but then it just got worse 

The way he talks about his exes and one night stands is outright repulsive. Women he wants to sleep with are labeled as “cockteases” and women he did sleep with are “skanks and sluts”. Like, you had fun, you can just say “thank you” instead of being such an asshole.

I really want to call him out on it, but I’m a bit afraid of his reaction because I never bothered to tell him anything about it. Besides, he really didn’t do anything to me, I don’t want to appear Karen-y, I know he knows he didn’t do shit to me.

The next time he proudly brings up the “slut” he fucked to me or my friends, I want to have a serious discussion wherever we are, whenever the time. I plan on being fairly cordial but very direct in order to get it through his thick skull.

It’s my granny’s birthday today. Mum rang me to say that my granny is really depressed, super down. If I acknowledge my feelings on this, I really don’t care and would be quite happy to never speak to her again or acknowledge her existence and that’s kinda terrifying.

That woman gave me 20 years worth of trauma that I’m still trying to unpack. 

Backstory, she physically and mentally abused me my entire childhood. My mum was a single parent and I had to stay with my gran a lot while mum worked. This woman would tell me that my mum didn’t love me enough to stay home and look after me (hello separation anxiety. She used to tell me how awful my mum was and how she wasn’t a fit parent. She would tell me to do something and if I didn’t know how, or did it wrong, she would beat me and tell me how horrible I was. Seriously, what 7 year old can make a full dinner without guidance. 
She would physically force me to eat food I didn’t like or was allergic too, then call me fat for finishing all of my food. Always commented about my weight to the point I had an e.d but even when I was at my smallest, i was still too fat for her. 
When I told her I was being sexually abused, she slapped me and told me I was lying. Both her and my aunt told me how I was a disgusting child for saying those things. I was 6.
One time, she’d sent me to pick up a prescription with no instructions as to how it worked. I got it wrong, she had me on the floor kicking me and beating me. 

My little brother is sick. He’s going to die, he has a form of childhood Alzheimers. Yes it’s sad, I’m losing my other half and my kids are losing their favourite person. But not once, not once has she asked how my kids are coping with this. There’s 2 years between my brother and my eldest. My eldest went through a tough time with finding out and she just didn’t care. When I told her we were all going through therapy to deal with it she said ‘sure what the hell do you have to be depressed about?’

When I think about it, I hate her so much. She ruined my life and it makes me so sad that I never had the chance to have a childhood. She gaslit me so damn much that it took for my therapist to take a break from our sessions to realise that none of it was normal. A trained professional had to take a break because I was so calm about everything I was telling her. Because I thought it was normal to be beaten with bamboo sticks. 

But because of the gaslighting, there is that part of me that loves her and wants to help. It’s scary being accountable for your own feelings and I’ve never felt more alone than I do right now. I hate her so much but I also love her. If she left and never came back, I doubt very much I would even think of her again.

2022-05-29 10:25:39,4,True,4,"Background: This guy (42, M) and I (33, M) used to date, and we stopped dating because we decided we were better as best friends. I'll call him John. John is a usually-happy alcoholic who can usually handle his booze, but every now and again gets angry and out of control. The last time this happened but several years ago, at a citywide beer festival. He had 11 strong craft beers. Fast forward to today.

Today, it was the Saturday before Labor day, and I was invited to a party by my friend. He also invited John, and I was more than happy to bring John to the party because he's my best friend. 

We get to the party, which is being held at our mutual friends' property, out in the countryside on the side of a very busy country highway with cars whizzing by at 70+ mph (people who live in Appalachia know what I'm talking about!).  So far, John is fine. He has had four or five drinks, and is becoming flirtatious, but is still in control.  

As the evening progresses, John continues to drink, and does not eat, nor have water in between drinks. He asked me where the bathroom is, because drunk people have to pee a lot more often than normal people, I guess, and because he was so drunk I walked him to it so that he would not get lost in the dark. Remember, this is out in the country. 

Afterwards, our host came inside and at this moment, John exits the bathroom.  Because this is a remote country property, there is no wash basin in the bathroom, and is in fact in the kitchen across the hallway. John walks across, into the kitchen, and is discussing something with our host. I am messing around on my phone to pass the time until he's ready to go back to the rest of the party at the campfire.  This property has been being used to hold random drunk that the owners were storing their to be sold later. Please don't ask me to elaborate on this, lol, it's quite another story all together.  

Next, several things happened very quickly.

1) John finds a pump action water pistol/shotgun, fills it with bottled water, and exits the kitchen.

2) John tells, ""Hey, check this out!""

3) I whirl around just in time to be caught in the neck/chest with what I have to assume to be a years-old stream of water from John's water gun (which I assumed to have been sitting full of water for about 14 years based on my knowledge of the history of this property). It absolutely soaks me, and it came completely out of my field. This is not something that I was expecting in any shape or form. We are inside of the property's building, and this is not the kind of place that somebody would shoot a water gun.

4) I angrily yelled that he was now on his own and that he could find his own way back home. I angrily stomped out to my car and slammed the door, intending just to sit there until I cooled down and finished wiping off the water with an old rag that I keep in my car for rainy days.

5) I finally cool off, and my host is outside of my car asking me if I'm okay, and to please not leave John behind. I told him that I have no intention of doing that, and that I just needed to cool off. He says okay.

6) I walk back inside, expecting to trade apologies with John.  John will not speak to me, and walks away into the darkness, turning around to give me a very half-assed apology along the lines of ""it was just a joke, and apparently you can't handle a joke."" Then, after a string of obscenities (keep in mind this is a family event and there are a bunch of under 5 year old kids there), he starts walking towards the road. 

7) Our host offers him an air conditioned room for the night to sleep. He completely ignores it and continues walking to the unlit road, where trucks and cars are whizzing past very fast.  I began to get very concerned at this point.

8) I try to stop him physically, but he is too big and strong despite his bulky form for me to stop him.

9) He disappears into the dark, and I frantically try to find our host who has by now walked back to the campfire, asking him what we should do. The other party guests are worried about him as well, and can't believe he just walked off into the darkness on a busy country highway.  He says to give him John's number, and he calls John. From what I could overhear, he offered John a room to stay overnight again, whereupon John hung up on him after telling him that his father was coming to pick him up.  How his 72-y.o. father was going to find him on a dark country highway without him being at an address is beyond me. 

10) John posts on Facebook that we are no longer friends, and it is because I cannot take a joke. He also text me similar things, with obscenities.

11) He has done this once before, so based on my prior experience, I figure hopefully he'll come around in a week or so, once he realizes that I am not going to react to this bullshit in the way that he's hoping. Just to be on the safe side, though, I message all of our mutual friends, telling them exactly what happened and to please pray for him because, even though we may not be friends anymore according to him, I still don't want him to get hit by a car on a dark country highway. 

At the time of me posting this, it is about 5 hours after the incident. It is now 4:42 in the morning, and I'm lying awake here trying to figure out if my best friend made it home or not. I do not have his parents numbers, and no way to contact him unless he decides to pick up his phone. I have to assume he has blocked me. 

This really sucks because we have been best friends for a very long time and I don't really have any other friends. Do any of you think there is a way for me to salvage this relationship?

I'm not entirely sure what my next move is. It's like my mind knows, but my body won't accept it. I'm hoping to get some advice or some help. I will do my best to give you all info.

I (24F), have been dating Dwayne(28M) for almost 4 years now. We currently have a 1 yr old son. I am currently in therapy to help work through this personally, however, our sessions are only 30mins long and appts are sporadic. Ex; I had 2 weeks in-between, 1 appt and a month between the next. I've spoken to him in regards to my feelings on multiple occasions, and yet I still don't feel heard. I've emailed him, texted him, and even sat down to speak to him. Progress seems to only last a few weeks before it's back to how it is. I will admit, lately I haven't been putting the same amount of effort as I used to because I feel so defeated.

Background:

He has 'cheated' on me at least 3 times.

1st- He was messaging his ex and she was sending him nudes and telling him sex dreams she was having about him and he would entertain her and tell how how great she looks. I was brought up in the convo, but he didn't stop. I found out about 1-2 months after.

2nd- I was pregnant with our first, and he was doing the same as last time. But, she had sent him a message with the username and password to an app that had all of her nudes, videos, and so forth of her. Use your imagination of what was on there. Again, she asked to keep it between them and he agreed. He then requested for pics of her doing things. She didn't. I found out about 5months laters.

3rd- the week he proposed he went to a party at his friends and he got drunk and made out with another girl. He told me the next day.

(This is why I don't put in as much effort as I used to, but there's more)

&amp;#x200B;

I know what you're thinking. Why are you still with him at this point, and honestly, a big part is my pride and not wanting to ruin the family we have. I don't want to have a broken family. I've grown up telling myself I wouldn't be what my family thinks I will. Yet, here I am. The other part is simply because I'm terrified. Everyone I talk to is very 50/50. Saying he could've done worse things.  I know I am very capable of going out and doing this myself. Being a mother and dong the things that I want. I just wasn't ready to give up. But, it seems as if that's the route I may have to take. He's in therapy for this because I told him after the second time, the only way I would stay is if he got therapy. He did. He goes religiously. He talks to me about his sessions and it seems as if everything I've already told him, they're telling him. But, he's listening to them and not me.

I've recently wrote him a letter expressing how he makes me feel, gave him examples of why, and really just poured my heart out to him. Like I was super honest about my feelings of being unheard, feeling like I'm losing the life in my eyes, and just feelings of hurt and betrayal. He asked if I would like him to respond to everything that I spoke about as he was replying. I told him yes. And when I got the response, it was not at all what I was expecting. He responded to one part of it, and even then he didn't really acknowledge my emotions. I read it all to my therapist (my message and his response), and they sided with me. Stating they understand why I would feel unheard and upset, but we couldn't really get into it because, again, my sessions are 30mins long.

I feel like he's trying, but I also feel like he doesn't give a shit, and this isn't how I want the rest of my life to be. I spent all of my life feeling like this, I don't want to continue. I was very honest and upfront before we even started this relationship. We spoke about communication, life if we have a kid, expectations, dreams, all of it. I've been feeling pretty depressed at this point. I don't feel beautiful anymore, I don't trust him anymore(I am always paranoid whenever his phone rings or he messages someone. And yes, I've told him this too) , and most importantly I don't feel like I am a part of this anymore. Like we're in two separate worlds. I just want him to be in unison with me and it feels impossible. I don't want to continue this, but I don't know how to bring myself to. I don't know if I should leave or find another solution. However, I feel like I've been at the halfway point waiting for him and he isn't. I know he's trying, but we're in two different worlds. What if his expectations aren't mine? But, I told him exactly what I am looking for. I know there's a saying , basically that if a person wants to do something they will. So this just means that he doesn't care? Or is it my own narrative? I don't know and I'm tired to trying to figure it out. What the hell do I do at this point?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I don't feel heard, loved, or respected and don't think I should keep trying. My body wants to, but my mind is over it.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you again for you time. This is just my perception of everything. If more examples are needs lmk, ask any questions.

&amp;#x200B;

Update:

We sat down and talked. I once again expressed how I was feeling and didn't really acknowledge them. Kinda went down memory lane trying to find excuses and realized he was really one to blame.

He’s only gone down on me *once* in the span of our relationship. At first, I could justify it and chalk it up to him being nervous or whatever, but a year in and he still won’t do it. Our sex life is okay otherwise, we do it fairly often and though I believe he enjoys it more, it’s fun for me too. Sex ends when he finishes though, never when I do. I go down on him a lot, even if he doesn’t smell/taste the greatest sometimes. He won’t on me though. I know for certain I don’t taste bad or smell. I shower and clean myself regularly and I’ve tasted myself out of curiosity. I asked him about why he won’t do it and he told me he had a bad experience with a past partner because she smelled/tasted bad and it was traumatic for him. Is this a legitimate reason to cause this? I’ve never heard of anything like this. It had to have been over a year ago that it happened and he did go down on me once and said that experience was good. I just don’t know what to do because I feel like my pleasure isn’t as important as his is to him. I don’t know how to address this or how to get what I need sexually.

For the past 3 months, I upped my workout intensities slowly (look up the 10% rule for runners) by waking up as early as I can to clock in my running workouts and had strength training as much as I could in the afternoon or evening. I could run 4-minute kilometers (not as fast as a lot of people but kinda good), can lift a moderate amount of weight and I can do pull-ups all day so my core was very good (or so I thought).

This morning, she told me she could do my washing for me. I told her it’s okay and that I can do it. I then told her that I can get my washing basket out of my room. But she persisted. I feel uncomfortable with her going in my room, as I like my privacy and to be blunt, I have a high libido and masturbate a lot. She has gone into my room and I’ve accidentally left toys/lube/etc out before, and it’s very embarrassing obviously. 

I went up to my room to get my washing and she was going through it, trying to find my work uniform. I told her that it’s fine and that I was coming to get it and do my washing. Whenever I confront her about things like this, she always says “I’m just trying to help!” 

I didn’t know that mom had gone back to my room to fix my mattress. I didn’t ask her to. I didn’t want her to. She walks out holding… an every day object that I was not using as an every day object. And asks me “why is X in your room?” I’m obviously very flustered and embarrassed and speechless. I don’t know how to explain it because it’s very much a kink thing. And it’s also none of her business. 

I just said “I don’t know” and “why were you in my room?” And again, she replies with “I was just trying to help you!”

I… am very uncomfortable and angry tbh. Because I’m so sick of not having privacy sometimes. I was in my room the other day with it shut, getting dressed, and yes I took a while. She confronted me about it, asking “what were you doing in there? Why did you take so long?” Etc.

So, I take some time to walk away and calm down and think about things. I decide to have an open conversation and tell her that I’m uncomfortable with her going in my room when I’m not in there, because my room is my own private space and etc. 

She reacts very passive aggressively, like usual. “Fine! I won’t ever go in your room again!” Etc. I told her I didn’t mean to upset her. She told me I was very rude and that she’s just trying to help and doesn’t understand why I’m uncomfortable with that. I tried to reiterate that I like my own privacy and that I see her going into my room as a boundary cross. 

She was clearly very hurt by this and told me that I’m “like two different people sometimes and usually normally such a nice girl” and etc. At this point, she was crying. I feel awful that I upset her and made her cry. I didn’t mean to, and I told her that. I apologised and so did she.

Obligatory this wasn’t today it was last night. I was at the bar with a bunch of my high school friends who live out of town. When we got to the bar, we met these three people in line who I immediately became friends with, 1 guy and two girls. One of the girls specifically I hit it off with super well. 

When we finally got into the bar, I lost them because I went with my friends. Eventually they found me and she said to me, “OP I missed you”. Then we went to get a drink and I admittedly got pretty fucked up. I don’t go out a lot, so when I do I go for it. So im drinking and talking, with her and my friends. When I go back for the third(fourth???) time, she starts getting really feely with me. She was rubbing everyone except the nether regions. And im not talking a simple pat, she had her hands all up in my personal space (I didn’t mind she was extremely attractive). This went on for a solid few minutes until she asked me “hey OP grab my boob”. And I said, “right here in public?” To which she responded, “fuck yea”. So I did, a small grasp of said boob, and she responded “no OP, grab it like you mean it”. So I did. I grasped that shit. You know the episode of SpongeBob where squidward firmly grasps the pole? That was me. If I remember correctly she whispered in my ear that “she liked that”.

Anyways, this was a first for me. Super odd experience. I then say we planned on heading out soon, and she asked where we were going. I didn’t know, so I asked where she was going next. She responded “where ever you are” and grabbed my face. All I could muster up was “oh okay cool see ya”. And then I walked her out, she grabbed my hand and said she had a lot of fun with me, and there she went. 

And thus, the virgin chronicles continue.

EDIT: People are asking me to text her and ask to take her out. The one problem is, she lives in Canada and I very much do not. Got the friends number though cause he was very chill and moving here soon, so there is hope indeed. Not much, but some

From a few years of knowing them, I know it's not the first incident that has caused trauma, between family difficulties (illness, not assault) and a previous abusive relationship, but they're a fucking kind person who doesn't deserve any of the shit that others have put them through.

     Y'all were ABSOLUTELY RIGHT and I (18M) thank you so much for all your advice and support. I dumped their ass. Turns out I dodged a HUGE bullet because it took a turn that nobody expected. 

Apparently my ex (19NB) had been soliciting nudes from a 13yo girl they met online. 

She reached out to me after I dumped them and told me everything, she was so brave and showed me all the evidence. It is irrefutably my ex who did it and there is absolutely no other way the texts can be taken. 

My heart aches for this girl, she did NOT deserve to have my controlling creeper ex doing these things to her. She confessed they even met irl at an amusement park and my ex touched her inappropriately there. I believe this wholeheartedly as I remember my ex telling me about this trip and ""meeting a friend"" there. I didn't know the friend was a CHILD 

I am shocked. I am appalled I ever gave love to someone who thought this was acceptable behavior and I can't help but feel guilty, I never knew it was going on but it still feels like I could have done something.

A part of the concrete wall fell on her head but, she wasn't lucky enough to die right away and had to slowly suffocate to death.

We witnessed her entire death upclose well, me more than my siblings because they got out of the rubble and seeked refuge while I was trying to lift the wall off of her head. Her screams are still fresh in my mind till this day.

 After that day my grandmother adopted us and while I am grateful for that I've always been neglected, insulted and misunderstood. She always showed blatant favoritism towards my two older siblings who looked like our mother, especially my sister who's basically her clone. I've always been looked over and my needs were always put last. 

I remember when I was 12/13 I was self-h@#^ing and I tried to talk to then about it but they just laughed in my face. After this I just became numb. 

Anyway, few days ago we were having a conversation about the past and what my grandmother had done and is still doing wrong as a parent. And I said if she knew she couldn't move on from the death of our mother the least she could've done is not to let it cloud her judgement when it came to the way she treated us. My brother called me an asshole and said I'd never know what it was like to love someone so dearly and have to watch them die in such a way. 

At this point I knew I should've kept quiet but my emotions got the best of me. I then asked her why'd she take us in if she knew she wasn't emotionally capable of looking after us, and my brother started screaming at me telling me I was being an insensitive, ungrateful asshole.

2022-10-03 21:01:04,18,True,11,"So I don't want this to be a super long post, but essentially -- my last relationship was very bad. When it came to sex, he would just take what he wanted when he wanted it, regardless of how I was feeling and he really didn't take any of my feelings or needs into account.

I went to therapy for a few years after I broke up with him, and even though it wasn't sex therapy, I think we worked through a lot of the damage that he did to me. Maybe not all since we didn't focus a lot on sex.

I'm in a new relationship now and I absolutely love this guy. I'm 29f and he's 31m. we've been dating for 3 months and I already know that he's somebody I want to spend the rest of my life with. it feels so rewarding to have struggled through a bad relationship, go to therapy, have worked on myself and then come into something so so incredible and wonderful and supportive.

I guess my question is, sometimes my partner does things in bed that trigger me. I've tried expressing it but it's difficult to talk about, and I think I know what the triggers are but I'm not 100%. I can't tell if it's gonna trigger me when it's in the moment, and I usually don't realize I feel bad until afterwards. when it happens, I get in a weird mood for a few days. I wanna communicate what's bothering me because I know that's probably what a healthy relationship should be, but it's hard to express something when you're not really sure and when it's something so finicky as emotions. my natural instinct is to pull away to give myself space to process and work through it on my own. I also don't know if I should be asking him to shoulder the burden of doing this or not doing that, when I'm the one who has the messed up history. Is it my responsibility to deal with the bad emotions and try to fix them? is it his fault that he's doing things that I've told him bother me? Is there something more I can / should be doing besides trying to communicate? I don't have insurance anymore so going to therapy isn't really an option currently.

I've been thinking about taking penetration off the table, because penetration without foreplay I think is what really what gets me. but I don't want to seem like I'm punishing him either :(

I feel stuck and I'm not sure what to do moving forward. he can tell when I'm in a weird mood, but I don't want to tell him, ""oh it's because of something you did"" when it's really something that I'm experiencing.

Has anybody been through this? Does anybody have any advice?

tldr; past relationship trauma keeps getting triggered. how much of the onus should be on my partner to avoid those things, and what responsibility do I have to try to deal with it on my own? how can I communicate this to him in a way that doesn't put blame on him, and also isn't constantly bringing up my past relationship?


Edit: thank you everybody for your kind responses :) this is exactly what I needed to hear. I'm going to talk to him tonight and explain my needs clearly and plainly. I'm not going to shy away or avoid confrontation. if I need to leave him because he's not willing to work on things, then I will. it was nice taking some time away to process and work through my bad feelings and anxiety, but I hope that as I get better at understanding, I'll be better about communicating with him (or whoever) in the moment instead of taking space. it's scary but when I view it at an opportunity for growth, it becomes a little more exciting at least. thank you all again!! ❤️",relationship_advice,where is the line between personal responsibility for your own feelings and your partner's responsibility to take care of them?,14.5,2022-10-03
2022-10-03 21:28:49,0,True,1,"I think I have sexually assaulted women on 3 different occasions.

1. When my highschool girlfriend and I were breaking up because she cheated on me, we decided to meet in the library to discuss it. I was very emotional and attached to her. I thought I loved her. She was awful to me and cold and gaslit me to believe it was my fault. When we were together we were very touchy and since this event had only happened a few days prior, I thought it was okay. I touched her boob and tried to kiss her. She got angry for a split second and I started crying and apologizing profusely after realizing what I did. She forgave me.
2. During that rough breakup I had spent time with my close female friend and her and I were hanging out and got drunk and high. I asked her if I could spend the night and she said I could sleep in her bed with her. She took me up to her room and took her shirt off in front of me like it was nothing. I got in bed with her and she put her ass against my thigh. For a while I didn't do anything but she started inching closer. I started touching her waist and spooning her and realized soon she wasn't into it. I went back to my normal position and went to sleep. I know my penis was hard so I hope she didn't notice and I felt awful. She woke up in the morning and said to me ""Next time you wanna do that ask. I'm fine with cuddling but next time ask"". I felt so awful. I apologized and she forgave me but I still feel awful about it.
3. A couple years later I met this girl who had just graduated high school. I was 20 and I thought she was 18 (she would would be 18 in two months). We had flirted and she had sent me nudes (again I thought she was 18) and we were hanging out at her house with a couple friends. During it I touched her butt because she had said many times that night over text she wanted me. I realized I hadn't asked her so I texted her again and she said it was okay and then came back over and sat directly on my hand. Later I found out that made her uncomfortable because I was being a creep about it. I made weird noises and shit and I feel so gross about it now. Again I apologized to her and she forgave me but I feel truly disgusting about that. 

I feel like a monster. I don't know if I'm deserving of love and I feel as though I belong in jail.

To start off, my ex was abusive. He was emotionally, physically and sexually abusive towards me for 1.5 years. He’d say awful things to me everyday, sex happened whether I like it or not, caused me to have screaming meltdowns and nearly drove me to suicide. 

He was really frightening by the end of our relationship. Saying things like “I either have to kill you or myself”, “you’re such a whore that even [another abuser] got a piece of you”, etc.
He aimed to make me cry everyday and had me convinced I deserved every bit of this awful treatment and would never have anything better. 

We’d have daily scream matches from something he’d pull out of thin air, I was exhausted and felt so hopeless.
There were many awful things he had done but what takes the cake is strangling me in his car and broke my phone.

Anyway, 3 months after I finally left him for good, I got a phone call from his mother that he had passed away. I didn’t find out until later that it was suicide.

I had just turned 12 and I got home from school. As I was taking my school uniform off, I noticed a big red patch on my skirt. I rushed to the bathroom, and there was blood everywhere.

I didn't knew anything about periods and seeing blood coming out of me and having cramps, I thought I was going to die.

I kept on going to the bathroom every 15 minutes and cleaned myself for the rest of the day.

I was so surprised. Apparently, she saw the blood on my clothes and just watched me panicking and thinking I was going to die without doing anything. She was angry at me for not telling her that I got my first period even though I didn't even knew what was happening to me and what a period was.

I told her that I thought I was having something like an internal bleeding and thought something was wrong with my organs, and that I was going to die in a couple of days.

She said it was normal and gave me a menstrual product, she just explained how to use it and didn't even help me put it on. She didn't explain how long would it last, how often would it happen... I learned everything from the internet myself.

She said that parents usually explain that this will happen to them to their kids but she didn't because "" she got her period at 14 so I should've had more time ""...

12 is a very normal age. I can't find words to explain how scared I was.

I'm 18 right now, my parents never explained anything to me. They still expect me to not know what sex is, or how woman and men's genitals are different. I can't understand these people, seriously.

I went through his reddit and found him in a snapchat explicit picture exchange group..This is significant since I broke things off with him once for suspicion that the snapchat he sent me (which was very…nsfw caption) wasn’t for me. We were 17 at the time and I was in school. He told me he just misread something and even showed me his snapchat to prove so. It was clean. So we got back together since I figured things happen. I found this community he joined 3 months ago.. But i got really lit last night and finally put two and two together. The snapchat that was sent to me was most likely for one of the girls he was exchanging with from the reddit group.

I confirmed that today, she did go to school with him, but given the history he has of virtual exchanging.. I need peace of mind that there was nothing there. 
My game plan is to meet him, have him call his bestfriend and put him on speaker, have him ask “Remember when i had that things with __?” And see if his bestfriend slips up or even knows anything about this.

My (25F) boyfriend (25M) are spending Christmas together this year and he and I like to buy each other lots of small practical gifts like nail clippers (since we lose them every year I swear) and funny slippers, instead of stressing over what to buy.   


He has longer hair than me and he's started looking more and more professional this year with a change of wardrobe and glasses. I've noticed him tying his hair up too which is new, before this year he only tied up his hair for sex since it gets in the way, I do the same or we'll end up all tangled up together. I'd love to buy him some hair ties and scrunchies so he has different colours to match his new wardrobe.  


This is going to sound stupid but I hate his current and only hair scrunchie. It's old, it's a colour that is heavily associated to his ex (his ex basically lived in this colour... her hair, her clothes, her bedroom, her makeup, her everything was this colour and he's repeatedly said that the colour makes him anxious now as she was pretty abusive).  
And on top of that it was given to him by someone who he hooked up with and then also tried (and failed) to get between him and I when she found out we had started dating. Given that he only used scrunchies to tie his hair up for sex, I asked jokingly at the time if it was a scrunchie for hookups and he said yes.   
So honestly seeing him put it on when we're being intimate always just makes me hesitate, it's such a dumb thing but it represents so much shit that I don't want to be reminded of in our most intimate moments. He doesn't see it when he's wearing it of course, but I do.   


But in his eyes he hates throwing things away or wasting things so I don't think he'd throw it out, but I think he'd also know I'm trying to replace it and he does miss his friendship with this girl even if they haven't talked in forever now.   


I don't want to look like I'm forcing away maybe the last physical reminder of a genuinely good friendship, I'm fine with him keeping it I just hate seeing him put it on when we're having sex.   
She had been adamant she didn't want a relationship but did a 180 when she realised he was getting into one and tried to change his mind. She and I both helped him out of a dark place when he broke up with his ex, I was also looking forward to meeting her until everything went tits up and now I never want to see her or even hear about her and my boyfriend broke things off with her.   


I'd really love some input.   


TL;DR:  
Boyfriend has a scrunchie, I want to get him new ones. The current scrunchie is a physical reminder for my boyfriend of a meaningful friendship he used to have, I'm worried he'll think I'm trying to get rid of any reminder of her.

2022-11-12 03:09:43,2,True,1,"Let me start by saying that me (27F) and my mother (54F) have had an on-again, off-again kind of strained relationship since I was a young teenager. My parents have been divorced since I was 2, mother was primary caretaker until I was 14 when I went to live with my dad. Not saying I was perfect because teenage girls are a nightmare, however my mother was…. unpredictable? You never knew what you were going to get with her. Either the nicest, funniest, most down to earth, chill person you’ve ever met or the absolute scariest and it flipped at the drop of a hat without warning. But when she’s good she’s soooo great. 

Also, I had (have?) a younger brother. He died of a fetanyl overdose in 2020 at the age of 20. Unless you’ve lost a child, there’s just no way to understand what a parent goes through when that happens. It wrecked my parents. They canceled on me on both Mother’s and Father’s Day and Christmas that first year. Which of course broke my heart because it made me feel like I wasn’t relevant. And I know they were hurting but they also have another child who is still living and who still loves them and wants to spend time with them. But I digress. 

So my parents and I were invited to one of my brothers childhood friend’s wedding in October. We probably would not have been invited to this wedding if my brother were still alive. So we all go. And at this point my parents are amicable enough that it’s not awkward to all hangout. It was bittersweet being there because I think all of us knew that we were there in my brother’s place. Ceremony commences, we all pile into the reception area, grab some booze and start mingling. I rarely drink. I had 4 glasses of wine. One of my brother’s friends had a 420 pen and I asked him if I could hit it. BAD IDEA. I immediately start having an anxiety attack and my husband walks me out to our car and calms me down. I pull myself together and we head back into the venue. Drinking, smoking, crying - my eyes are bloodshot AF. 

When we walk back in, my dad and his girlfriend are sitting at our table so we walk over and sit down. I asked where my mom was and dad told me she was dancing so I turned around to look at her (dance floor was directly behind me). We make eye contact, smile, I turn back around and say something along the lines of “she’s always down to dance” and we started on about something totally unrelated to my mother. The night went on, everything was gravy, we all said our goodbyes, my mom hugged and kissed me goodbye, and we left. 

The next morning, I wake up to a text message from my mother that says “I hope you enjoyed talking trash about me last night because it’s the last time I plan to be around you. I’ve tolerated being with you around your husband, your dad, and your brother’s friends all watching you and your hateful, hurtful eyes cutting this way and that because I know you were talking mean about me. I don’t like people who talk bad about others and Im tired of working my ass off to have a relationship with you when it’s not only not reciprocated but apparently unwanted. I love you but I’m done being abused by you.” 

And I’m just like, huh? Nobody was ever talking trash about her at any point in the night. Not once. So I reply: 

“I’m not so sure that saying that you are always down to dance is talking mean about you. That was all that was said. You have created some false narrative in your head thinking that all I ever do is try to run you in the dirt but in reality, nobody was talking shit about you. The only thing that anybody even said about you was that you liked to dance. And when I was looking at my husband I was telling him to go dance with you. And I didn’t “cut my eyes” at you mom I had 4 glasses of wine and then I hit brother’s friend’s pen, I might have looked at you but I wasn’t cutting my eyes.” 

And then there’s a long thread of other texts where she realizes she doesn’t have a leg to stand on in her baseless argument so she tries to redirect the conversation by throwing my dad under the bus for every wrong thing he’s ever done in his life stomping him in the ground even though she “doesn’t like people who talk bad about others”

Honestly, I don’t know if I need advice or if I just needed to vent but that felt really good. Stupid bitch.

Thats just a extremely short version of what happened, but I feel guilty. He told me about other girls me aged.. he said one of them was only 15, and doing her was the best thing that ever happened. He has had other victims, and I know that there will be more if I don't report it. But I cant, I dont think Im allowed to. It was my fault because I was being a stupid teenager, and any proof I have is just screenshots and his face. My family would freak out to, and would hate me. I feel like I have even an obligation to keep doing what he wants just to save other girls from trauma, because since Ive already been through it it wont hurt me as much.

2022-12-13 03:09:05,2,True,0,"I (24f) have been friends with “F” (29m) for 4 years now. Him and I have been super close and basically tell eachother everything. I moved back to my home state 2 years ago and have only seen him maybe 3-4 times since then when I go back to visit. During the last two years “F” quit his job in construction and teamed up with him old therapist to open a center for troubled youth. He rants and raves about how much he loves it there and how much he loves working with these kids. The kids he typically works with range anywhere from 12-24ish. 

When he first started there he was just a peer support, but after 2 years their center has flourished and became way bigger than they originally thought which is awesome! His therapist friend decided to bump him up to basically a “therapist” and give him a case load of kids. 

This caused rift with the other licensed therapist which led to one leaving the job and one eventually being fired (this is what my friend told me.) Due to this he took on more cases than what he originally started with, but he didn’t mind putting in the extra work because he knew it was going to a good cause. 
(Side note, I love my friend my he has never taken a course or gone to college for being a therapist. Nor does he read up on current therapy practices) 

Fast forward to October of this year, I go down to visit to look at colleges and apartments because I plan on moving back in the new year. He offered to have me stay at his house which was great, because I saved a lot of money from not having to rent a hotel. 

The first day I was there it was awesome, we watched tv, hung out, got some food and just caught up on life. We made some plans for later in the week when he was off from work. The second started off great, he offered for me to tag along to his parents house and I happily said yes. When we got there his sister and her kids were also there (she and the kids were super nice.) I noticed his niece (13f) was super attached the minute we walked in. I brushed it off because who doesn’t have a favorite aunt or uncle. As the day progressed I noticed everytime he’d sit down he’d make her sit on her lap or ask her who her favorite person was or who the most good looking person was. I mean it wasn’t just once it was at least 4-5 times within a few hrs. Again I just brush it of because all family dynamics are different.

Fast forward to later in the day we end up and leaving and going back to his house. We are talking things over about the visit with his family and his phone rings. He takes the call in front of me and he is goofing around with whoever is on the other end. After about 5-10mins he ends the call and apologizes saying it’s one of his girl’s who is client at the youth center. Mind you this is a Sunday at 4-5pm. He then precedes to tell me how she called him because she was with her friends and they had they idea to start selling drugs and wanted to know what he thought of it. I laughed it off and asked how old she was and he said 15. That made me feel weird for some reason but, again I just brushed it off. The he started to what seem like gloating about how well he works with teenage girls and how much they love him to the point they will call and text him after office hrs. He also said how his whole case load of kids is now teenage girls. I didn’t say anything to that and just left a silence in the air. After a minute or two he immediately said “but if they hit on me I shut them down immediately.” Again I didn’ say anything and maybe after another couple minutes he changed the topic

I investigated a little and found that he is following a good amount of young girls on instagram (I’m assuming who are from the youth center.) I felt sick to my stomach and told him I was gonna stay with aunt for the rest of time I was there. I still have yet to address anything with him, but since then I’ve kept our communication limited. I’ve told two people about everything, one of those people was my own therapist and she even said the whole situation was very weird and sketchy.

2022-12-18 05:41:13,0,True,3,"Trigger warning: I will be talking about an ED (Eating Disorder, in my case ARFID), although you might find it educational as it is a rare ED not many people know about.

It's 2 AM and I just had two spoonfuls of sugar because I felt weak. As I lie down in bed, I'm trying to remember what I ate today and how long ago my last meal was. Days like these are the hardest, so I just needed to get it off my chest.

In 2020 a lot of unfortunate events happened in my life/to my family that were traumatic to say the least, combined with the pandemic. Up until then, I had always been a major foodie - I had a food addiction, and at that time was quite overweight but had started treatment to lose the weight healthily. All my life I had been up and down, but mostly on the overweight side.

I miss it. I miss my body, I miss the joy of eating and drinking whatever I wanted. I miss the things that I had no idea were a secret benefit of not meeting the stipulated beauty standards.

It sounds a bit like a nightmare, and it is. August 2020, from one day to the other I was suddenly unable to eat. Looking back now, I think everything that happened at the beginning of that year hit me like a train at full speed and this is why it was so sudden. I had had some minor symptoms before, but that is when this nightmare began.

I could not eat or drink *anything.* Not even water. The first few months were the worst, as I survived and was extremely hungry. I lost 40kg in about 2 and half months, which is a lot. I think my saving grace to a small extent was being overweight, but it doesn't mean it was easy. I went to every doctor you can imagine, as I couldn't make sense of it and in reality I still can't. I was diagnosed officially about four months ago only, so at the time, I thought there was something wrong with my body.

It's been past two years now. The ED was so hard to diagnose because it was only ""discovered"" in 2013, less than 10 years ago. The name is ARFID, and it apparently comes from my OCD. I say this because at least giving it a name did bring me relief, and because I had never before in my life heard about it as most people.

Basically, I am what some would call ""picky eater"" except that term is extremely wrong. There is no picking for me, it's completely involuntary. Have you watched Extraordinary Attorney Woo? She has the same ED but hers stems from her autism, and I did cry when I saw it on screen because I felt understood and represented.

I am doing better, but an ED is like a rollercoaster you can never get out of. Some days, I can eat almost like a normal person, which means four meals a day. Some days, I can go 16 hours without eating and not realize. I have now gone from weighing almost 100kg to around 57kg or so. Yes, I've lost half my body weight. It's very, very strange to me and sometimes I feel as if it weren't my body.

I'm trying, and I will keep on trying. But somedays it's just hard, like today. I had improved a little and was able to incorporate some foods, but I think December is a triggering month for not just me but a lot of people. OCD is one of the worst mental illnesses you can possibly have, and surviving it feels like trying to fight against yourself, constantly.

I'm okay despite all, definitely have been worse. Sometimes I try to watch something funny to get my mind off of it. But I wish I could go back. I wish I didn't have this illness, I wish I never did.

I am re-learning to accept my new body as well. Now I ""fit the beauty standard norms"" and I get stared at a lot. When you're not used to that, it can be really intimidating. I hate it but I also don't want to live my life hiding my body. I didn't hide my body when I was overweight and I don't wanna do it now either. The male gaze, however, is a struggle and even more with my history and with this illness.

I wish I could go back. Grab a bottle of water and drink it all at once, without any issues. Eat chips. There are so many foods I have not eaten in over two years, it's crazy. By now, food is no longer important to me other than for the fact I need it to survive - I will eat whatever bland thing you give me if it has calories and some nutritional value. I find no joy in food anymore. Maybe the only exception being the occasional apple juice.

You have no idea how difficult an ED is until you have one. I hope you never do, and I hope mine goes away just as it came. Or that I can manage to unlock the secret to improving it in a more constant way, so I don't have to worry every day that I will faint in the middle of the street or that I need to take supplements because I literally can't perform something that is a basic, primitive need to survive.

I'll be better tomorrow, and I'll try to take this low to maybe eat a bit more. But tonight, I just wish I had the power of making it disappear. I want it so bad to go away, even though I know it won't. Enjoy your meal for me, reader. Thanks",TrueOffMyChest,I wish I could go back to the time in which I didn't have an ED,1.5,2022-12-18

2022-02-26 13:31:25,11,True,0,"**BG INFO:**

When I had _my first sexual partner_ (close to a boyfriend but I was young and naïve and didn’t realize this man didn’t love me), my sister regularly checked him out in his photos, saying she wants him to dominate her in bed because “he has that look” and she’s “that kind of girl,” claiming he would fall in love with her if he ever visited, because she is the “best girl.” She later got angry with me for having a partner in the first place, claiming that she should have been first. Around this time she also pocketed my income,  because she believed I was stealing her pride by making money, and _I allowed her to do these things._ 

My sister and I have been through some abusive hierarchical indoctrination shit, so while I very much dislike her dynamic of being the “best girl,” I keep in mind she was, in a sense, indoctrinated. It has been 3 years since we have been removed from the situation and are regaining health.

Currently, my sister is single and has only had 1 relationship that was very strained.

**YESTERDAY:**

I was showing her a picture of my current boyfriend I took on my phone because he was doing something very funny (stacking pillows on his head). 

Btw, keep in mind she has met with him and played games with him, eaten dinner with him (with me in the room cuz we were all in a group). She KNOWS this young man. She knows my mother approves of the marriage should it happen (he is too young rn). My boyfriend is not a picture idol. My sister knows him as a human. She has little respect for him or me. 

Anyway, back to the photo. She goes “omg he’s thick” and wipes her fingers my phone screen on his chest. And then says something like “his beard is dense” or idk what she said but referencing his thick beard. I feel uncomfortable. In my discomfort, I try to be the opposite of her thinking it will make it go away. “Ahaha, _I think_ he needs to trim his beard. It’s so messy!” 

She says “Sorry for checking out your boyfriend or whatever it’s just he’s thiiick”

And I _instantly_ slip out: “It’s okay, I guess.” I allowed her… again.

I thought I was better than that. When she tried to control my income for a second time (this time she asked me to stop working altogether and find a different job because she feels hurt that we are working in same field), **I said no** (in a nice way). And she is now in trouble with our employer for pocketing my income two years ago.  So I can say no to her in _this way,_ but I can’t when it comes to my boyfriend?

She is acting in the same way as before, it is just less severe. She is (attempting) controlling my income and checking out my boyfriend, embarrassed to be single. I feel triggered and haunted by the bad memories, especially because she later got between me and my ex just by getting under my skin with her words. And she got our parents involved and hurt me.

It also pisses me off that she’s treating him like a movie star when he’s a human she knows. It’s disrespectful. And has she no boundaries and respect for her sister’s (my) relationship??

I WISH I said something in that moment. I wish I said “You know, that actually makes me very uncomfortable. Can you not say those things in front of me?” But it’s too late for me to give a comeback now.

This is the same girl who would sulk  when she _thought_ I thought her boyfriend was cute even though I never overstepped my boundary. 

So… HOW do I approach this? Just pull her aside one fine day and say “hey, remember…” (describe situation of showing her that particular picture, her checking him out, etc.) “… Well, at the time I said I was okay, but that was a knee-jerk response. It actually makes me very uncomfortable when you check out my boyfriend in front of me, even if you are joking.”

Or have I lost my chance? Should I wait for the next instance when she does this and try my best to address it on the spot?

**TL;DR:** Jealous sister is checking out my boyfriend and acting controlling like before. But it’s not as severe as it was w/my previous partner when she was very jealous and felt her status was threatened. This time she did it only once and it wasn’t sexual.

But I’m worried a sexual addiction of mine play a role in my talking and interest decline. 

I have struggles with porn that I’ve just recently been realizing have made me do a lot of bad things, or more accurately had a contribution in me playing bad things. When pornography wasn’t enough, online RP and chats filled the void. 

I remember having thoughts of falling into the online RP stuff. While I never actually got into a relationship with her I had occasional desires of doing what I used to, though never did as we got more talking to each other. As we got closer I tried to surpress is but never lost those desires. I wanted to stay somewhat loyal even if I had the thoughts, so I avoided getting to them as we talked more closely. 

Once I broke things off, it was because I wasn’t as interested and wasn’t feeling what I needed to be feeling. We went on an actual date after months and I just didn’t feel the same as i once did through texting. It was not her fault at all. But I went back to the online RP stuff a few days later after I broke things off. 

I’m worried these desires played some role in my lack of commitment and interest. Like maybe a subconscious urge. Of course I just have commitment issues based on fear or being tied down and unhappy. I understand it was not a kind thing to do and I’ve recently quit that stuff, as well as porn and other issues. But I feel bad for what I did. But like the fact I went back so soon seems to indicate to me that I didn’t want to be with someone which I want to change.

2022-03-10 23:11:32,27,True,29,"Hello reddit. I am writing this on a phone while my wife is currently sleeping so I am sorry for mistakes.

We are a young couple and have started dating since 2014 since she was 16 and i were 18 and married for 4 years. So about 2 years ago we were cuddling and somehow we got into a talk about those fake sleeping sex videos on phub and sites alike where girls prented to sleep and she got an idea that we try it. Of course we got horny and did a deed and afterwards tried to do try sleepng like that. The original idea was for us both to fall asleep but it didn't work at all because I couldn't keep my erection nor I could sleep at same position like that, so for me it didn't work but for her it was kind of okay but as soon as she lightly feel asleep she woke up instantly when i barely moved myself. So that didn't work and we just moved around to seep normally. 

Over period of a month we tried doing it from time to time and it slightly started going better. It was problematic because staying in one pose for a lot of time would make my right leg hurt a lot so I had to move my leg around whicy would wake her up, also losong erection and getting near the exit of vagina would also wake her up, moving faster a bit would also do make her wake, or just her body moving around while sleeping would wake her up. Bit by bit it started prpgressing and even if it was kind of painful experience to get used to it we started doing it more and more frequently, from several times a month, to every few days, up to every single day.

To explain it further as we progressed she stopped waking up and sleeping lightly, I couldmove inside her as much as I wanted but not overdoing it, i could touch her shoulders, head, etc. without her waking up, also I could get out and get in for example if I had to do something. Usually she would fall asleep in a timeframe of half hour at beginning, and it went down up to just several minutes usually less than 8. Of course I would try to stay inside and hug her as long as possible but leg pain would take great toll along with tiredness  due to late hours and so on. It is a great experience which has its ups and downs but the real fuck up is that i encouraged my wife to do it so often tha it became our habit. She wouldn't  even ask me for it as soon as we are ready for the bed while we talk it is expected from me to get in, either we would have a sex beforehand or when she wakes up. She doesn't count this as a sex since she is not awake but it is pretty sexual to me after  all this time haha.

As time passed this got to the point where we had to do this daily like literally daily even on first day of her period I would put her panties a bit down with cleaning wipes and pads attached to panties, get in, and usually we would do the deed as she gets really horny on periods, stay inside for like 40 minutes until she is fully sleeping and go shower. Once we had a fight I can't  remember what it was sbout and we went to sleep in separate beds, after several hours around 4am she woke me up crying and sobbing she can't  sleeo at all no matter what even as I was still angry we promised each  other that even when we have a fight we wouldn't  hold this against  each other as revenge. So this was where we realized that my wife can't  sleep if we don't  do this like at all. At start she didn't  believe it and wanted  me to record it where I move likewe have a normal sex, or that I go out and inside again while she sleeps, and many other things.

While this is a very nice experience, few times it fucked up me because I was tired and couldn't  sleep until my wife fell asleep, or getting awaken in middle of night or morning when she wakes up, or being unable to go out with friends if she works third shift and I have to stay home for hour or two when she gets home, or being unable to go to gym and so on. Of course even after two years she still sometimes lightly wakes up while im moving inside or moving myself but she gets back at sleep within seconds.

I still love my wife the most and if she sees this I hope she won't reqd between lines and find it as me complaining  about hardships 😂.

Thats it for now, if you have any question feel free to ask I will try to answer it tomorrow. Goodnight everyone.

So I've been on the depo shot for 3 months now? I went in for my second shot the other day, Monday, and the nurse tells me ""omg you're late for your shot! you could be pregnant!"" I freak out, so I text boyfriend from the bathroom of the clinic taking the pee pee test and I'm like ""BABE. Don't freak out I just need you to tell me it's going to be okay, the nurse said shit to freak me out. That I might be late for my second shot which means I could be pregnant?"" He freaks out, starts psycho calling me, cursing me out, etc. I... I didn't mean to create this reaction. Maybe I should've been wiser? But... I just really wanted some comfort because she freaked me out. I pissed in the damn cup anyway and it got tested... Came out negative of course. I demanded to speak with my doctor. She comes in, tells me nurse was wrong and is stupid, I'm on time, etc. I tell boyfriend this and he's still panicking and freaking out. I come over to his apartment and he's like... not being nice. At all. It was a scary thing for me! I just wanted support? The nurse made a mistake and gave me some anxiety, but he is being unnecessarily rude and blaming me for every bad thing that has been happening to me as of late, which I thought was out of line and unfair. He says he cannot trust me anymore, and we will use condoms from now on in addition to my depo shot. I leave crying, whatever, whatever. He apologizes eventually and things are okay. Then he initiates sex just last night. He says he wants to use condoms from now on. Um... okay? If it makes you feel more comfortable we can. We stopped using condoms after 6 months in our relationship. We have been together for almost two years now. He uses a condom and... it doesn't feel good. Like... just being honest, it f\*cking hurts. It's pulling skin down there, even with the use of expensive lube we have, I feel no warmth from him, it's just pressure and skin pulling. He notices I'm not moaning or anything and starts to get mad. Then complains it's hot in here, the music sucks, then pulls out and just complains that the condom hurts him and he's mad that I wasn't being honest when he would ask if I enjoyed sex. Like what am I supposed to say? He wants to use a condom, fine, I respect that boundary but why am I expected to fake noises and stuff? It doesn't feel good. There's a reason we stopped to begin with. I spent $50 to be protected by a top tier form of birth control and you want to complain that a fifty cent condom hurts? You asked for this. I don't know what to do. We've been struggling lately sexually, I don't feel like he treats me romantically much anymore, and sex last night was really important to me. Him getting mad and complaining over a decision he wants just really dug at my self esteem. He got so mad last night he refused to cuddle me and then left in the morning without saying anything to me. Then he comes over and starts a fight between us and makes me cry then just leaves because the conversation got too difficult to him. Are we destined to end now because he wants to use a condom? How do we mitigate this to where we both feel safe and like our needs are being met?

Edit: To respond to like, almost everyone here, I didn't mean to paint him like he's this horrible boyfriend that I get nothing out of. Despite having our ups and downs, he HAS been one of the most enjoyable parts of my college experience. I still feel blessed everyday that he was put in my path, destined to last forever or not I have learned so much dating him. I just honestly don't know how to mitigate this issue. I don't like the feel of condoms, and clearly he doesn't either. But I do understand wanting to have that ""security blanket"" AKA, a condom on his part. How do we both get some feeling of security out of this while still feeling satisfied? Is mainly what I'm asking. I'm not looking to just dump him to the curb.

Hello everybody here is my situation:

TL;DR
My mother said her friend found me sexually attractive and I am seeking advice to maximize my chances in having a relationship with this friend after 2 years.







I’ve met Anna for the first time  when I received my first debit card  (she is a bank manager ) and knows my mother because she does her hair.

About a year or two ago (a month after meeting Anna)  Anna came over to my family’s house to get her hair colored  by my Mom .That day I arrived home from some errands and as I walked in I greeted both of them didn’t think anything .
Later that night after Anna leaves  my mom tells me laughing after a few cups of wine that Anna found me very attractive and wanted to blow me.

Next day I acted like nothing happened and it was just stuck in my head like wow I had the opportunity and didn’t make a move or even ask a question.

My question is 
-should I make an attempt to ask Anna if what she said was true and have a casual relationship?


The only way for me to privately speak with her would be to make a bank appointment or bump into her at my mom’s job coincidentally since she doesn’t do her hair at my home anymore.


It sucks guessing or imagining “what if” I could have said these past 2 years because we were alone for a good 10 seconds at home because my mom left to go grab money in another room that day she did her hair .Those 10 seconds I could sense by the way she was looking and speaking to me that there is some attraction.",NoStupidQuestions,Seeking Advice M(20) on F(33),2.0,2022-03-20

She doesn't feel comfortable doing exotic things that I do enjoy in bed, so I sometimes just play alone when I want something she can't offer (a dick. I use a dildo, since I'm not cheating on her, and she uses as well. We get along)

Today I was taking a bath and decided to play with some toys we have. But the thing is, I enjoy showering in the dark, completely dark. Just me and some smooth music. I started to wash my penis and then all of sudden I was excited, and decided to masturbate using one of our sex toys, a very hard dildo. 

I then reached out for it but I needed some lub to use it, so I walked off the shower and grabbed the lub in her drawer. Spread that thing all around the dildo and tried to sit on it, but it wasn't going all the way in. I put some more lub, try to put the thing inside and also didn't go it all. So I gave up and went to put it back but this time I turned the lights on and saw that I wasn't using lub, I was using sunscreen, which have basically the same size and shape of the lub. Started laughing hard and couldn't finish it masturbating, went back to the shower so I could wash my ass and my whole bathroom was smelling like a beach.

2022-04-14 11:22:30,6,True,6,"I don’t know what began it for me or what made me the way I am. I remember a friend (same sex and same age as me) telling me about sex and making me show her my genitals when we were around five, but it doesn’t seem like that would really be traumatic. 

From then I had a bizarre interest in sex and remember reading about it and trying to understand something that was too complicated for my child brain to comprehend. It was around this time my grandmother’s husband and I began to “play kissing.” I remember doing this both before and after they moved houses - so it wasn’t something that just happened once. They moved when I was 6 for reference. For years I felt that it was my fault for doing something so disgusting and that I’d wanted to kiss him. But if that’s the case, why would he continue to do that with me and why would he close the door and make it private and not tell my mom or grandma? But I still feel guilty about it anyway. I still feel like it’s my fault and that I wanted it and instigated it. 

By the time I was a preteen I was sending nude photos to strangers on the internet and even wanted to be a sugar baby. I look back at that not only with so much regret and guilt and disgust but also sadness for the little girl who felt so unloved and unimportant that she turned to showing her body to revolting strangers who wanted to hurt her. I don’t remember what was going through my mind, but I realize now that it was out of desperation and wanting so dearly to feel valuable to someone. My parents, especially my mother, were very neglectful and absent most of the time.

When I was 12/13 I got into an online game that was for kids and made friends with people through it. In our group of friends, there was a boy who was 18 who groomed me over the course of several months, eventually forcing me to take nude photos and send them to him. He said he would kill himself if I didn’t and that he wanted to fly to where I lived to be with me. The worst part of the whole thing, though, was that none of our other friends believed me. They said that it “didn’t sound like him.” I ended up telling my mother in a roundabout way and because I wasn’t direct and had initially lied about something she became very angry with me and never discussed it with me or brought it up again. 

Looking back as an adult who has never been in a relationship and has an extremely difficult time connecting with other people, I realize that this sordid past is not just a source of guilt for me over what I did but a continuing blockade for me in my growth as a person. I haven’t even told my therapist these things. I plan to as soon as possible. I was confused by why I felt so guilty about potentially having sex with someone I’ve been talking to lately - and I realized I cannot ignore this any longer. It will never go away and it won’t get better if I just ignore it.

&amp;#x200B;

We have been married now for almost 5 years. My sex drive is not as high as my husbands and this has been a constant point of contention in our relationship. We met our senior year of high school and he was my first everything, kiss, boyfriend, the works. Back then my desire for affection was actually quite high, I always wanted to be holding hands, kissing, hugging, anything to feel close to him and he was the same. Once we got married everything was good for about 6 months. Around that time intimacy became very painful for me. I went to the doctors and got diagnosed with lichen sclerosis. It makes sex painful for me and a build up of scar tissue made it hard to feel anything I would describe as pleasurable. My doctor at the time was really awful and told me that there was nothing that I could do about it, along with a few other awful comments about my body. For two more years I suffered before I was finally able to get real help. during this time my husband became very bitter and resentful of me. He would refuse to hold my hand in public or hug me in front of other people. He blamed me for his pornography addiction because I wasn't satisfying him. He would get upset over not having intimacy more often and would tell me about his friends sex lives and how jealous he was of them. Physical touch is his love language and he would blame his treatment of me on our lack of intimacy. It got to the point where every physical touch I got from him led to sex, even something as simple as a hug always got pushed in that direction. It got to the point that I avoided everything from hand holding to kissing. I eventually found an amazing doctor who was able to help me with my condition and the pain overtime became less and less. We conceived our child and pregnancy was awesome for me. I finally wasn't in pain any more and I wanted intimacy again. When our baby was born it wasn't long before I was feeling the pressure again. Now our baby is ten months old and sex is miserable for me. It's not painful anymore but it does not make me feel loved at all. My husband has gotten better at prioritizing me and making sure that I have fun but I'm always wondering if he's going to get upset with me. Sometimes he gets upset if I want to use toys, or if I want to touch myself. He will get upset if I don't focus on him enough and I feel like anything that he does to make me feel good he expects for it to be paid back to him. It's gotten to the point that I avoid him like the plague. Literally no hugging, kissing, caressing, even some dates I will avoid because I know what he wants at the end of it and it makes me feel so dirty and used. Where these things used to make me feel wanted now I just feel manipulated and resented. On top of all this he recently admitted to me that he doesn't like me and that he thinks that I am no fun. I don't blame him but it makes me want to be with him even less. I don't think I could willingly be intimate with him when I am feeling so unwanted. We have scheduled a visit with a couples counselor which I am looking forward to, but I would really like some advice on what I can do or ask my husband to do to help me enjoy physical touch again. Despite how this might seem my husband really is a good person and is always open to criticism and tries really hard to do better, we know that we both have our individual issues when it comes to this topic and just want to make things better.

The difference is instead of physically punishing myself, calling myself a f**g*t or restricting food. I'm instead punishing myself with social isolation. I just don't speak with anyone meaningfully outside of work because I don't feel good enough for anyone's attention. I'm not out at work, I didn't come out at University or School.

2022-05-11 22:31:00,4,True,4,"Hi all! To give some background info, my boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 3 years now. We started dating in high school. My parents are very traditional (especially my mother). I never told my mom about my boyfriend and I basically kept him a secret up until now. The reason why I did not want to tell my parents was that 1. she is very traditional, if my boyfriend was not strictly Chinese and did not have a good family background then she would disapprove; 2. I need to put all my focus on school (this one is completely understandable). She did know that I was friends with my boyfriend and she had already told me that she liked him as a friend for me but not as a boyfriend. For the reasons I have previously stated, my boyfriend is not Chinese and he does not have an excellent family background. I was planning on telling her when the time was right. When I could sit her down and, have a calm and civil conversation with her where we could discuss my relationship and I could listen to my mother's concerns.

My plan was completely ruined when my mom was going through my clothes and she had found this torn-off condom wrapper in my jacket pocket. She had called me letting me know that she found it in my pocket. She and my dad waited till after marriage to have sex so, we both have different ideologies on this matter. Honestly, as a daughter who is more than terrified of my mother when she is angry, I was really scared. When I was rushing home that day, I was in a dilemma. I could either lie and say that it's my friend and she wanted me to throw it away or, I could just tell her the truth. The one problem with telling the truth was that she is going to severely dislike my boyfriend, I really did not want to risk that. Whether the route I took was immature or not, I chose to lie. Obviously, my mother wasn't born yesterday so, the lie did not work on her. I had then, told her the truth. I told her everything, I said that I dated him for three years and etc. She then told me to break it up with him. Her reasoning was that ""a man should never touch a woman in that type of way unless he wants to hurt her"", she'd also say ""a man should help the woman in her life instead of getting in bed with her"". I wanted to reason with her but it was no use. She wouldn't listen to the fact that he isn't just some random guy. 

I had told her that I have no desire to break things up with him just because she wants me to. I probably shouldn't have said that because she went bat shit crazy. She was hysterically crying and slamming things onto the table and saying that ""I was killing her"" and that I'm ""choosing my boyfriend over her"". She then starts to blame my boyfriend because my grades were ""slipping"". My second term grades were not that great but they weren't terrible (A in bio, B+ in chem, B+ in psychology). I had one class (physics) that really pulled my GPA down where I had earned a B-, physics is my worst subject. She now blames my boyfriend for everything wrong I have done in my life. She says that my recent behavior (taking naps, slacking off, going out with friends) is all because of my boyfriend. Keep in mind that my boyfriend has been with me for 3 years, and even before him, I had taken naps and I had slacked off. But right now, I was ""slacking off"" because I had a week's break before I had to start my spring courses. In my opinion, I feel like my grades and other aspects of my life has improved a lot ever since I met him. It just hurts that my mom cannot hear me out and try to understand what a great person he is. In general, my mom says that he radiates negative energy and it is affecting me. She calls him trash and other names even though she has never met him in her life. 

I do realize that she is also scared of me and that she is just trying to protect me. Tbh, if I were her, I'd also be mad at my child for keeping something this big away from me. But the reaction she gave off seemed a little bit unnecessary.

Currently, my mom is keeping me at home. She says that she wants to see me radiate positive energy even though, I am in a completely miserable state right now. I had told her I broke things off with my boyfriend even though I did not. I told her just to give her peace. I have to act as if I forgot about my boyfriend in a matter of a day. She now controls my life, she makes me go to bed at 11 pm and makes me wake up at 9 am. I want to go out with my boyfriend, but I know that if i told my mom I'm just going out with 'friends' she'd be face timing me to see whether I'm really with my friends or if I'm with my boyfriend. I feel like I have no freedom right now. I'm not going to disobey the rules she set for me because it is in fact, her house and her rules. 

My dad understands me more and is willing to listen to me explain the type of person my boyfriend is. He even is willing to meet with my boyfriend to get to know him more. In the end, my dad advises me to focus on my studies but he has no problem with me being friends with him. 

Honestly, I do feel like I ruined my entire relationship with my boyfriend, I should have told my mom about my relationship before it completely blew over. She now views him as some kind of rebel. It frustrates me that she doesn't give him the time of day to even get to know who he is. I feel awful that she views him that way and I fear that my boyfriend thinks of himself badly now.

 I feel the need to lie to her about some parts of my life because she never likes to discuss it and she just takes full control over my own personal situations. This isn't the first time she has gone through my stuff. Usually, when I am out, she takes this as an opportunity to go through my desk drawers and makeup. Because of this, she did find other things in the past such as my edibles and whatnot. Because of this and the whole condom situation, I feel like she does not have a lot of trust in me anymore. At the same time, I don't really trust her either anymore. I'm pretty sick and tired of the lack of privacy my mom has for me. It frustrates me how quickly she thinks that I changed in a bad way just because I chose to have sex. I don't feel the need to apologize for having sex with my boyfriend because I have nothing to be sorry about. I don't think it is fair to punish me for something that I willingly wanted to do. I am willing to try and figure out where my mom is coming from in terms of my boyfriend.

What are your thoughts on my situation? Is it reasonable to keep dating my boyfriend behind her back? Is my mom right about him? Could you see where she is coming from?

TL; DR: I was preparing on telling my mom about my 3-year relationship with my boyfriend until mom found condom wrapper in my clothes. Mom has different ideologies compared to me (she waited till marriage) so she immediately thinks my boyfriend is a bad influence without having met him at all. She wants me to break up with him just because I had sex with him. I refused and she started to hysterically cry and thinks that I'm choosing my boyfriend over her. Dad says that I should focus on my studies more than relationships. My grades are good except for physics. Mom puts all the blame on my boyfriend for my B- in physics. Mom does not want me to even talk to my boyfriend let alone be friends. She is controlling my life such as when I sleep, when I wake up, keeping me at home, not letting me go out unless its with her. I want to go with the decision that I'm going to hide my boyfriend from her as I am not going to break up with him just because I had sex with him. Mom lost all trust in me.

hi all, my (19f) boyfriend (21m) has always been iffy about certain circumstances through our relationship of almost three years. i’m just looking for opinions and if there’s anything i can do to help him?

my boyfriend has always been extremely extremely uncomfortable to be even the slightest bit intimate in public, no kissing, handholding, barely hugging, yknow that kind of stuff. it never really bothered me. but lately there’s been a few more incidents?? that have led me to question what might be going on. 

we were at a nightclub recently and the theme was pretty much naked women and vintage porn i guess, but no nude dancers or anything, just a pin-up photo here and there and maybe an old porno playing on a random tv. everyone else in the bar was completely fine with it, and i didn’t even notice what was going on until i saw him looking really uneasy and he brought it up. i just said to be cool and look at everyone else having a good time and he settled down but not much. 
he later mentioned that he was uncomfortable because he was ‘watching porn in a room full of woman’ and i think that’s valid enough but considering i know when he’s lying, that certainly wasn’t the case. 

we also went two a strip club a few nights later, got to showing our ID to the bouncer and my bf suddenly threw his hands up and stormed off, even though he was excited just a few seconds before. we did not talk about it as he said to ‘leave it at that’ and just went home normally. he also later mentioned that i was ‘testing him’ to see if he was ‘loyal’ ? but i’ve never been the jealous type, ever. it was my idea to go and he was keen until we got to the door and it just seemed like something inside of him made him snap and run away? 

he is also borderline ashamed when people mention our sex life, our friends are quite….nosy people and make crude jokes. he almost flat out denies that we’ve ever had sex sometimes LOL. i’ve always found it funny and sort of cute but lately i’ve been thinking about it more and i’m just wondering what might be causing him to be so uncomfortable about these things ? he’s not cheating on me or anything like that, and our sex life is pretty decent.

Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I debated on doing this for awhile, but now that I am 18, I thought it’d be best. 

It started 9 years ago. I was playing on my small laptop my mom had given me in the living room. Mom was upstairs in her room, I was in the living room with the dad. Now, before this moment, I thought the world of my dad. He was my hero… that all came crashing down when he asked me to lay on the leather sectional with him. I thought nothing of it. Until he grabbed by hand and held it in his. He put it down his shorts and placed it around his penis. He told me to stroke it. I was frozen. Scared because I knew it was wrong. 

I’m not sure how long that lasted, but he told me not to tell mom. I’m not sure why I didn’t. But this marked the start of a long 9 years. 

I fought back at first. He’d lock us both in my room and force himself inside of me. This was easy for him as he was a stay at home dad, while mom attended college during the day. I would fight and scream. Cry my eyes out. He did it while we had family over, friends, and I always hated that. 

I had a lot of friends when I was 9. I would go out and hang out with them like any normal kid. But once he started his daily ritual of touching me and going inside of me, he prohibited that. He made me the mom of the family. Because of that, I’m now more mature than those my age. It sucks because I’m lonely now. I have no friends because of this abuse. I wasn’t allowed the highschool experience. 

I became scared of him. If I didn’t give him what he wanted he’d throw me around his room by my hair. He would apologize by fucking me. Even just looking at him differently would set him off. And then again, he would beat me, fuck me, and then go about his day. 

Eventually I stopped fighting back. I just let it happen as that was easier than enduring the bruises. I stayed like that. He lasts maybe a minute now. Does his business and then leaves me alone. He texts me everyday about what he’s going to do to me when I get back home from school. I fucking hate it.

It’s now 9 years later. I am 18. He rapes
me everyday still. He no longer beats me, but screams at me if I still don’t give him a peck on the cheek when he goes off to work. The smallest shit like that.  I hate him. What bothers me is that he’s perceived as a saint out side of this house. I’ve not told anyone this, but I plan to be moved out this summer. He doesn’t know that. Nor do I want him to. I just know that I have the power to ruin his life with screenshots and videos that he knows nothing of. 

But that doesn’t mean I’m not scared. About what’s going to happen to me or my family once I walk outta that door.

Edit 1: I should mention that he’s an elementary school teacher. It’s going to make it even worse for himself when I do come out and say it. Lots of people look up to him, little kids. Little girls. And I can’t stand knowing he’s started touching me when I was their age

Edit 2: some are confused. He agreed to stay at home while mom did her schooling. Then while mom had a job, he did is own schooling. Which is how he became teacher.",TrueOffMyChest,I (F18) am a victim of Incest. I’m not sure what to do.,158.5,2022-06-25

Let me preface this post by saying that I suffer from Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome a disorder that mainly causes vomiting episodes if I become overly stressed or anxious along with other symptoms that I will not discuss I also keep a fairly large trashcan in my room as I practically live in it due to a multitude of reasons. On with the mess up


I don't know exactly when it happened but at some point I had an episode and got sick into my bedroom trashcan and in my more than likely sleep deprived state just stuck the paper towels I used to clean up what little mess there was on top of the main mess and went to bed, proceeding to forget about it. Since then I and my family have noticed an odd smell in the house that comes and goes and we've never been able to locate the source. Just recently I started to come out of a major depressive episode a little bit and decided to clean up my room some to help me further feel better, I got to the trashcan and noticed that it faintly smelled like the weird smell we had been smelling so I decided to take it out and hopefully end the mystery of the smell, when I lifted the bag: All. Hell. Broke. Lose. The cheap dollar store bag essentially disintegrated and everything that was in it spilled out into the trashcan, unleashing a horrible smell that can only be described as the swamps of degobah overtop of some rotting animal that had been soaked in skunk spray. I immediately began to cry and loudly gag before running to get one of the thick black trash bags my grandma uses for her garden wast, putting it over my trashcan and dumping it, which was my second mistake as it stirred everything up and made the smell ten times worse. I grabbed the nearest can of air freshener and proceeded to spray the whole thing into the bag and garbage can this did nothing good for the smell and only proceeded to make the room and house smell like an ocean of nasty, my saving grace came in the form of the second can of aerosol that sported a different much stronger scent, which mostly covered the smell. I managed to get everything into the bag while holding my breath before running outside and disposing of the bulk of the nightmare, before retuning inside, washing and sanitizing my hands twice. I got back into my room and discovered there was a part two to this living hell as the trashcan smelled just as bad if not worse than what I had just taken out. At my now awake and horrified grandma's suggestion I took it into our guest bathroom and poured most of a bottle of Dawn into  it before running scalding hot water from the shower into it while she got my grandfather up and they opened every door and window while pointing ever fan we own outside and cranked the ac up as high as it would go to try and help with the smell that had permeated the house. Meanwhile in the bathroom my efforts were fruitless and the smell and nasty had soaked into the plastic and forever cursed the trashcan with it's horrible stench. I decided to just throw it away before going to town with the air freshener trying to get rid of the smell. Cut to now an hour later the house smells like Island breeze with whiffs of the swamps of degobah 2.0 coming though, my cat is  hiding under the porch to avoid the smell while giving me me dirty looks, my grandma is in the garden sitting between her rose bushes to avoid the smell, my grandfather went to get more febreeze and oder elimination packs, while i'm on the porch contemplating my life choices and writing this.

tl;dr: I got sick in my trashcan and forgot about it, leading to the swamps of degobah 2.0 when I went to go empty it and learning why you're supposed to empty a trash can right after you get sick into  it.",tifu,TIFU By Not Taking Out The Trash And Accidentally Creating A Swamps Of Degobah SItuation (TW: Gross),20.5,2022-07-23

Throwaway account cuz duh. We’re both very new to sex, and are staying away from penetration for while. We’ve been fooling around and trying new things, such as for her, handjobs and blowjobs. They feel good, but for some reason I can never finish from them, no matter how long she’s doing it for. The only way I can finish with her is from heavy dry humping, which is sometimes embarrassing.

I’ve never had issues staying hard, but for some reason I can never finish no matter how good it feels. She’s visibly getting insecure and keeps asking if I’m enjoying it, and I always tell her it’s amazing. I tell her that finishing isn’t the goal but she’s still clearly really defeated by this.

I’m afraid I’ll hurt her feelings if I start critiquing her. I also don’t know if I could even give advice cuz obv I don’t know how to do it lol. I just don’t want her to feel bad everytime I can’t finish, especially when it’s not even her fault.

When I give her some kind of treatment, she always feel obligated to at least try, but she’s getting more and more discouraged. Any thoughts??

So I worked as a substitute teacher for a year at a high education public school. As a mechatronics engineer I teached mostly older students, above 30 years old, enrolling technical courses but to fill my 40 hours/week I had to take some high school-technical classes, with students age ranging from 17 to 19.

As it was a kind of entrepreneurship/ product design class, I divided the class into groups, asked for a product to each one and went to get the teaching going. With the groups well stabilished, I started to give examples with similar products found in the market today, to show who will be your future competitor.

Heres the FU starts. One of the teams had the idea to build a breathing ventilator to help Covid infected pacients. I was excited with the idea, as I had worked at the begging of the pandemic building a similar machine. Trying to help, I remembered a similar product called ""Continuous positive airway pressure"", most commonly known by it initials, CPAP. Or was it CIPAP?

Anyway I was sharing my screen and searched CIPAP without second thought knowing damn well that google would got it right. Hell, even the first results showed the correct product and the ""did you mean CPAP?"". Not wanting to delay the class by clicking a link I went straight to the images, so I could show it and move it on.

Fatal error... Behold me were photos and more photos of vaginas, penis penetrating vaginas, nude photos of women... I quickly close the windown but certainly my students saw it as there as an endless flow of ""F""s and ""Exposed"" at the chat. I apologized and tried to explaind the situation.

2022-08-29 04:12:02,3,True,1,"I'm 16. I'm a junior in high school. I do dumb things, but I never thought those normal high school things could cost a life.

Backstory: when I was a freshman, I was incredibly sheltered. Borderline homeschooled, grew up in a southern Baptist church where saying the lord's name in vain meant you automatically went to hell. Eventually, however, I learned how to play the game of high school, joined a military program, and found a good group of friends. I excelled in the program as I had no social media or outside influences to distract me. About halfway through the school year, I was still quiet innocent but gaining curiosity. I signed up for discord behind my parents backs and I was off. I could talk to whoever I wanted and say whatever I wanted. It was amazing. Until one night I stayed up a little to late with my then crush, ""Jackson"". A guy who I thought I could trust, and who knew I knew little to nothing about relationships. He promised me that just ""one more picture"" and we could be together. About 20 pictures, 3 months, and quite a few tears later, I was ghosted. The ""one more"" was never enough for a relationship with him. 

The rest of that year was spent growing, and adapting to the whole sexual part of high school. Realizing that inappropriate pictures are not the pinnacle of teenage romance, and not even a good part of them. When Jackson came poking into my life again around the beginning of sophomore year, I shut him out and made it known that I knew what he did was wrong. And that's when the bullying started.

Being in this military program and being some of the better ones in it, we had the same groups of friends, and with that came the group chats, and worse, the ""jokes"". I would comment on a meme someone sent to the chat and immediately I was bombarded with ""okay but who asked?"" ""Its because you're a women"" ""You have to be above 5'8 to have an opinion in America"" and it would be the same 4 boys out of the group who would take it too far and keep adding on to the joke until eventually they landed on the joke ""What if we just kill OP? Who's gonna miss her?"". Then, when I expressed that death threats werent exactly comedic, they gave me a nickname. ""Sea bass"", like a sea bass from animal crossing, making fun of how ""easy"" I was to ""catch"". Eventually, I snapped on everyone, wrote a paragraph about how awful everyone was being to me, and how i didnt appreciate it and left all the chats. I was met with immediate apologies from Jackson, how it wasnt supposed to be mean, and how he wanted to make it up to me. I blocked him. 

I tried, once more, to heal from the hurt he had caused me. Until I heard that he was dating one of my best friends(Lilly). She didnt know about our bad history, because up until recently I kept most of the details under wraps. They seemed happy. It didnt make sense to me how my very much asexual friend was to please Jackson, but as long as they were happy I didnt ask questions.

Then the sexual assault accusations start. You see, Jackson is quite the prankster. That's why he thought that it would be so so funny to force my lesbian friend(Braylen) to grab his penis and make out with him. She thought it was less funny, but didnt come forward to the directors of the military program because she knew he wouldnt get in trouble. It's as if he was the golden child. 

I wanted to tell Lilly about what Jackson did, but I didnt want to out Braylen like that. I knew she was hurt from what she went through and i didnt want to cause her anymore harm. But then a freshman(hope) mentioned in casual conversation how her and Jackson were dating until a few weeks ago. By then, Jackson and Lilly had already been dating for a few months. Once again, I held my tongue because I knew this information was not mine to tell. 

Until a second freshman (Noelle) came forward saying how him and Jackson were still dating (jackson is bisexual). When questioned, Noelle had no idea about Lilly. Finally, it just became too much. I told Lilly about everything that had gone on. Lilly and Jackson broke up in mid July, right before our junior year, which brings us the the current time period. 

TLDR: a boy (jackson) used me for nudes, sexually assaulted a lesbian, dated 2 girls and 1 boy at once, and bullied me for my entire sophomore year ot high school.


Recent events: Me and Jackson havent talked in a few months. Hes aware that I was the one who told Lilly he cheated. We were awkward together but I made sure he was never outright mean to me. 

Starting my junior year,  I was assigned a group of freshman to me to take care of, basically like a teacher. In a casual conversation one morning, one of my freshman girls tell me how shes had a ""weird interaction"" with someone from my grade. I prod a bit, and eventually she shows me screenshots of Jackson begging her for nudes. Thank God she had the common sense that I didnt to not send them. After consulting with a friend, we decide that enough is enough and take the information to the program director. He assures us the situation will be assessed, and that's all that we can do at that point. I was later informed that Jackson was ""demoted"" from his position in the military program. Nothing more. 

Tonight, I get a call from Braylen. I answer, laughing and joking and she cuts me off quickly and says 


""OP, I need you to listen to me. Dont talk, just listen to my voice. You absolutely cant repeat this anywhere, especially with my name involved in it. There are some people out to get you right now. Leave every single group chat you're in. Block people you dont recognize on your social media. Turn off your location, and only talk to girls for the distant future. Theres a group of guys attempting to spread inappropriate pictures of you to the whole school. They have pictures of me too, passed out drunk. They have info on me that no one knows, and that I havent told anyone. These people are dangerous. I have this covered, and I'm negotiating with them as we speak. They dont know I know. But if they knew I know, and if they knew I told you, theres a very possible chance that I could die. I just wanted to warn you of all this. I have your back. My girlfriend has your back. But stop talking to boys completely""
And the call ended.


I've spent the night deleting, unsending, and blocking. I've triple checked the locks and windows. I'm sitting here awake at 3AM because I'm simply too scared to go to sleep. I dont know what to do. I cant check on Braylen for fear of them finding the call logs. Tomorrow after school me and Braylen are driving to a secluded spot and shes filling me in on everything. Best case scenario is that shes negotiated successfully, and the inappropriate pictures of me and a few other girls and the pictures of her intoxicated are deleted. Worst case scenario, we don't talk tomorrow. Somewhere in the middle is us both giving up our pride and reporting everything to the police. 

I'm so scared. I dont know what to do.  Im 16. I do dumb stuff. But every teenager does. So why is mine so much worse? And why wasnt ""Jackson"" dealt with in the first place. Like he should have been, and maybe he wouldnt have constructed this plot to bring us all down.

2022-09-03 22:25:42,3,True,0,"I (25f) broke up with my bf (31m) after one year together.
We started things quite quickly, after 6months chatting and video calling he moved in with me from another country. We had rough times at first adjusting to our different lifestyles but we got over that pretty fast and things were going well. 

I knew that he had some anger issues in the past (punching walls and breaking things when angry) but he said this happened over 10 years ago and he's grown up after that. I trusted him. He said he had never hurt anyone physically and I believed it.

Last spring I got a medication that sadly affected my sex drive very badly and understandably it caused some issues between us. But he said he understands I need the medication and he's OK with us not having sex so often. But in every little fight we had he threw it on my face. That was the first thing that made me feel uncomfortable.

Later on, I started taking another medication for my depression that really helped me and I started going out with my friends again. It was really nice because I really missed my friends and seeing them again helped with my mental health. He blamed me for needing friends and he should be the only one I need. 
One time I went out and he got mad because he couldn't come (work next morning) and demanded me to stay. I didn't so he said it's over if i leave and punched a wall making hole to it. It made me very afraid but he apologised later and said he didn't mean what he said. We continued together.

Few weeks later I was going out again and I came back at 10.30pm, bit tipsy. I had spend 40€ on drinks. He didn't like it. He said he doesn't like me drinking and that 40€ is way too much and he'd understand me spending max 15€. For context, drinking in my country is rather expensive, one drink is like 8-10€. Also he said from now on I have to come home by 10pm if I go anywhere.

At this point I told him I don't want this kind of relationship. He broke down in tears and apologised for everything. I said I still dont want to stay because I have seen enough of this kind of relationships and how they end up badly. 
He told me I'm making the mistake of my life and its all my fault. Because I broke up with him and I overreacted to things.

Couple of months pass by and we still live in the same apartment because he refused to leave. I started to consider moving out myself even tho I really wanted to stay in the apartment we had. Finally he got a job from his home country so he decided to leave. He asked my help for mailing his stuff there, I helped. He asked me to help him book flights there, i did. He asked me for help renting a new place, I did. Etc. Lots of stuff I did help with because he doesn't speak the language here. 

Then one day he saw my notification from tinder that I had downloaded AFTER we broke up. He calls me a horrible person and told me I haven't loved him if I am already on Tinder. He also told me ""did you know that I pushed my ex to a table and she wasn't as horrible person as you are"".
He also called me out for not helping him out with leaving even tho I did a lot and I don't feel like I even owe him that. On top of all that he said HE needs time to recover from my shit and this abusive relationship. I asked the reason and it was lack of sex.

This whole mess made me feel like I am the horrible person after all, not him. And that I overreacted and threw away the best thing I had.",relationship_advice,Did I overreact and broke up for no reason,1.5,2022-09-03

I am from Germany and I moved to Sweden temporarily for a really good job in a start up company. I was hired to manage the media section of the company. The company was co owned by two individuals, apparently two best friends aka my boss and his pal. His pal left the role but returned a few months later and was offered the second highest job below my boss. You can see that my boss decided to keep the power for himself.

However his pal had nepotistic practices leading to an internal crisis and my boss fired his pal and his associates. We thought our boss did the right thing but things only got worse. The boss began to accuse almost everyone of being an associate of his former pal and began to fire people or demote them with the replacement being well well, the boss himself.

I was doing a lot of the hard work as my coworkers were fired leading me to post news and media updates regarding business and the company. On one day, I was randomly confronted by my boss during a business meeting in the company office and out of the blue told me I was fired, I begged him and told him how much work I did to which he responded ""I didnt put you in charge of the media team so you can post news all day"".

It was really infuriating but it only got worse. I returned home to Germany and some time later, the boss messaged me asking me how things were going and I felt that maybe he realized his mistakes. He seemed nicer too and asked me to play a video game with him and if I were to lose a boss fight, I would have to (in his own words) ""lick my dick, and lick (his brother's) dick too"". I felt uncomfortable and I asked if he was joking but he made it clear he wasnt. I blocked him.

He then proceeded to use another phone to message me about how he wants me to lick his privates for an entire month. I had to repeatedly block multiple numbers of his and this continued until recently when he got a new number and sent me a picture on Whatsapp of him with an old car and said he saved up money (I assume the company collapsed hence why 'saving up') to buy a new car so him and his brother could drive to me and take me back to Sweden for you know what.

At this point I didnt block him because I wanted to get all information I could and send it to the police. A few days later, turns out his car crashed into a bridge because his brother took the wrong turn while drunk according to him. My boss began to complain about fuel crisis and said he will buy a boat and do some Navy SEAL type landing and hike to my city.

So they did actually buy a boat but his brother didn't know where to sail and the boat broke down quite far out before they had to be rescued by fishermen. All of this was sent to me via Whatsapp with images including images of their small boat stranded in what looks to be deep blue water before being rescued.

Now he said they will buy a flight ticket to Oktoberfest and find me for sure. For one I have informed the authorities about this but they think I am joking and I cant contact Interpol on this due to this possibly being a joke. I dont care if this is a joke, this is really frustrating and this person has my address.

So I'm a woman, and my partner has been wanting the deed. I however haven't felt into it. We have intimacy issues on both sides. 

My question is, is 'blue ball' actually that painful?
My oh is saying its so painful he can't lay down, can't sleep etc. I've said about taking care of it himself as I'm not in the mood. To which he replies with 'its not the same, it still hurts.The only way it doesn't is if it mouth or sex' I then get the comments of 'I hope we can sort this out soon cuz this is so painful'  and 'don't touch me, it's unfair if you touch me and we don't have sex' (touching him as in trying to hug him)
Is he guilt tripping me?

For context, 
I don't feel in the mood due to being touch starved, there is no non-sexual intimacy from him and my touches are rejected. 

Because of this I don't feel sexual or loved. And anytime in the past I've gone to bed while feeling like this the act is very basic, no run up for myself and its always about him and his needs. So it's not a very tempting pass time while things are like this.

2022-10-12 00:33:14,9,True,3,"TL/DR My older brother has been sharing his *bud* with me but I found out he's been lying and hiding much bigger things and addictions, so I informed my mother about it despite my part in it.

Hi. This is a throwaway - for reasons that include trying to protect my identity and my older brother's. This is actually quite terrifying. For some background, I feel like I should describe the environment we grew up in. Mom was the breadwinner of the family while my dad was a stay at home father. As we got older, my dad ended up suffering alcoholism, and he now lives with his parents in a different state. My mom fell into treatment resistant depression. They both still suffer from these and while they haven't been the greatest parental figures I do know they love and care for my brother and I.

For the past few months, I have been using my brother's supply, and have admittedly enabled him in some situations. I no longer plan to continue this behavior. I got access to his computer yesterday, and ended up reading his text messages. I have always been nosy when it comes to this kind of stuff, often trying to find his stash before I began to use with him. My actions regarding that are my own and I take full responsibility for them. The person on those texts is a whole different person than I thought I knew. He has been using harder substances (i'm not sure what the rules are in this sub regarding this) for YEARS. He has been to rehab before but I have found out that it did nothing and he continues to do these things.

Before I started using his stash, I would catch him all the time and share it with my mother. Oftentimes, nothing would come from it and eventually I just gave up. After finding out all of the lies he's told everyone, money stolen from my mom, etc. I showed her all the proof she would listen to. My brother understandably hates me from this. Am I the Asshole?

EDIT: I see now where I've worded things out of context. I didn't go through his messages in order to gain more weed. I was worried about where he had been going and wanted to make sure it was at least at a safe location to meet his dealer. The other texts I went through were just me trying to see just how long he'd been doing more than he led on. I found multiple instances of him doing idiotic and dangerous things. He's not a bad person. I love him dearly, I just don't know how to help him. My mom bails him and I out of everything. I am almost through with high school. I don't want to make it paint him in any negative light by stating that he graduated a few years ago, but I think it does help with furthering the context. That being said, I don't want any of this to come across as deflecting from my actions. I am a hypocrite when it comes to doing weed as well.

2022-11-06 00:14:36,5,True,1,"For context: I'm 15 female and she's 18 I think this happened when I was around 6 or 7 and she was I think 9 or ten... I remember it vividly and I still do a bit ... But I don't remember the ages. She stopped luckily

Now onto the main part of this:

So my older sister when me and her were kids uh... She exposed me to porn and I know people say that exposing to kids porn is basically sexual abuse I can consider it sexual abuse tbh. 

First of all she literally made me watch porn, thats probably why I hate porn because I was forced to watch it. It was disgusting to say at least

Because she literally exposed me and ruined my innocence I was a child and she was one too... I don't even think she got abused I think she found it herself or someone told her about it.

This continued idk when it stop but maybe when I was 8 it stopped?

BUT BUT BUT one event I vividly remember

Now this is where I'm confused if it's sexual assault here we go:

So me and my sister are in my parents room (when they were together) she tried literally spread my legs and got on top of me and tried to do something I don't remember much 

I didn't like it and felt like it was wrong and I told her to stop or I said not THANKFULLY SHE LISTENED AND STOPPED DOING THAT.

I don't know if this is the only time I only remember this specifically.

I never had sex in my life... I don't know if I will freeze if that happens or get flashbacks

I don't even know if I have PTSD I don't think I have at least... Because I don't have the symptoms of PTSD.

I think the reason why I'm so mad at my sister till this day maybe:

A. Is because of these events as a kid that she ruined my innocence and tried to do you know that to me so that's probably why I have so much anger towards her

Or

2022-11-06 00:20:12,19,True,10,"I didn’t think I would have a fairytale life or anything, I always knew I would meet a few different people, date, enjoy. I never thought my life would include two rapists, dating (and later engaged to) a compulsive liar and then a narcissist. I’m looking back at my last few years and wondering how the hell it got to the point that I’m so willing to throw myself away and be miserable when I’m short changed every fucking time.

Why am I dating someone who wants 2-3 other girls at the same time? Why was my last hookup also doing “poly” and seeing me on the side? Because I have no self worth, that’s why. I grew up with an abusive father, I have always had men use me for my body and I’m not even 30 years old, miserable because everyone seems to want just parts of me and they don’t want to give much back.

Over the years, men (and women) honestly have convinced me that this is what I deserve. I’ve bought into it. I’m worth being called names, being ignored, then called back in, being a side piece, being a secret, being lied to, cheated on, raped, beaten. It seems to be the price I have to pay for some semblance of a relationship. At times I decide “I’d rather be alone” but it doesn’t last — I’m back offering myself up for peanuts.

I feel like trash, I somehow am always a side piece or a discarded second. I am not worth someone’s attention and value, apparently. It’s evident with all the men who want to cheat on their wives with me, but keep their marriages in tact….the men who lie about being divorced, the ones who lie to me about big and small relationship things.

And now I’m with a narcissist who legitimately abused me and I let him — I walked away and then crawled back. I just want to feel like I mean something to someone, even for that little bit of time I guess. 

I don’t even know what a healthy relationship would look like anymore. I don’t know how to feel loved or how to hear someone call me “beautiful.” I’ve let men abuse me and push my limits, ignore them even. I keep forgiving people, I accept apologies or believe their lies.

2022-11-16 02:09:56,526,True,3095,"**i wish i was kidding.** i had to make a throaway account for this one, since my family and friends follow my reddit account, and i sincerely do not want this to be traced back to me and be known as ass freckle girl.

me (20F) and my *now ex* boyfriend (20M) had been together for almost a year when this went down. for context: normally, we would have sex in the dark, since it just happened to occur at night, or when the lights were already off. it’s not like it was a deliberate thing, it just happened to turn out that way.

so a few days ago, we both finished class at the same time. it was noon, and i didn’t have another class until 2:00, and him at 3:30. so, we decided to go back to the apartment to make some lunch and relax. by the time it was 1:00 we had finished eating. we ended up having sex, and as you’ve probably already guessed, 1:00 in the afternoon isn’t exactly known for being dusk. as we’re going at it, we change positions to where he’s behind me. all is good and well, untill he suddenly stops. i asked him “what’s wrong?” to which he apologized, said he wasn’t as horny as he had initially thought, and asked if we could stop.

totally understandable, it happens. so, he pulled out and put his clothes back on, and we just proceeded to cuddle in the sunlight for a little bit. honestly, i was a little hurt that he didn’t offer to finish me off, as he always will when he finishes before me, but i didn’t let it bother me since he said he wasn’t feeling it. i also didn’t want to finish myself off, because it felt like that would be kinda ‘rubbing his face in it’ in a way. so, we cuddled, but i noticed that he wasn’t really… touching me. he was just kinda laying behind me on his side with his hands under his head. so i thought, maybe he just felt bad for stopping sex, and was worried that i was upset? i left it alone.

fast forward to yesterday: things seem to be normal, and we’re making out in bed. i start to make a move, and he stops me and asks if i showered that day. he’s never asked me that before sex before, so i was a little confused.

“no, i showered last night…”

“are you gonna shower again tonight?”

“i’m planning to.”

“okay, lets wait until after you shower then.”

i told him that i didn’t wanna wait until after i showered, because then i’d be all hot, sweaty, and sticky, and have to shower *again.* he got annoyed at this, and started mumbling, saying stuff like “ok then, whatever. i guess we just wont have sex.” he proceeded to get off of me and go back to scrolling on his phone after that. so obviously… i was extremely confused. then i thought, why is he so adamant on me being fresh out of the shower? and why did he stop sex midway through last time?

the anxiety of not knowing was was happening was driving me insane, so i sat up and i asked him if i smelled bad. he put his phone down and gave me a weird look and said no. i asked, kinda passive aggressively at this point, if he was sure, since he seemed to be adamant that i needed to shower before sex.

he got kinda uncomfortable at this and i could tell he was hiding something. after a lot of back and forth, and him telling me that i was ‘paranoid’ and that ‘nothing was going on’, he confessed that the last time we were having sex, he saw that i ‘had forgotten to wipe’. i was **floored** at this. never in my life have i forgotten to wipe my ass under any circumstances, and i sure as hell *couldn’t* forget, knowing that i was sexually active. i asked him what the hell he was talking about, because that seemed ridiculous to me. 

he got pretty upset with me. he told me that he saw a ‘brown speck’, on my asshole, and the he could ‘practically smell the shit in my ass’. he then went on to accuse me of deliberately only having sex with him in the dark so that he wouldn’t see that i don’t wipe my ass. i had had enough at this point. 

as many of you might be familiar with, when i was first beginning to shave my bum, i used a handheld mirror to navigate. i noticed in the process that i have a small freckle on my anus *(i’ve named her matilda)* which didn’t really come as a surprise, since i have some scattered larger freckles/moles all over my body. *they are all named*

i pulled my pants down and i bent over infront of him — rest assured, i did this knowing i hadn’t pooped today, because as we all know i don’t wipe. i pointed to matilda. “this?” i asked him. he *lost it.* he called me disgusting, began to scream at me and tell me that i’m the ‘grossest woman he’s met’, before storming out and slamming the door.

he didn’t come home last night, and today he texts me telling me he can’t do this anymore, and is gonna send our friend over to come get his stuff from the apartment. he also made sure to add “good luck finding a new roomate who can deal with your putrid smell.” before i blocked his number.

i’m just bewildered right now. i feel like i can’t talk to anyone in my life about it either, because i don’t want any connotations about not wiping my ass being associated with me — even though i’m sure he’s telling everyone he knows that i don’t wipe down south as we speak.",TrueOffMyChest,my boyfriend broke up with me over a butt freckle,1810.5,2022-11-16

I just started watch the movie ""Possum"" after seeing Ryan Hollinger's analysis. Spoiler alert, but basically the main character was abused by his uncle as a child and now, as an adult, has to live with him again after losing his job.

It made me realize how some people who suffered abuse are able to tolerate living with said abusers, usually out of necessity and/ or convenience. I typically hear about this scenario among family members. Maybe that's why?

2022-11-16 21:58:18,17,True,39,"It happened sometimes last week, I accidently cut myself while wiping. No biggie, it happens and it usually heals up just fine. This time was different! 

Unfortunately I got really ill with a bad cold/virus, a few days later, which made me bed bound for the whole weekend, I took all sorts of OTC medicin to combat the nasty as best I could. Ofcourse, that also meant I wasn't showering.

When I finally did, I could definitely feel soreness coming somewhere down there, near my urethra. I rinsed, and tried my best not to think about it. 

But yesterday I could hardly walk, it hurt when I peed. And it hurt when I was sitting down, so I decided to go have a look, by sitting on a mirror. Unfortunately we don't have one, so after a few fails at taking pictures on my phone, I had to ask my husband to have a look. He said it looked like an infected crater.

I showered, while thoroughly cleaning the area, with a pain so immense, I almost fainted. From what I gathered from the grainy pictures I managed to take, it looked like the area was white on a red surface. 

So today I trotted off to the doctors, feeling very embarrassed from not only infecting a little cut like that, but also making such a cut to begin with!

I'm back home now, have showered again, with another assault of immense pain. Only to have yet another shock, when the antibiotics was applied.

I'm on the couch, seriously considering of just going to bed, to forget all about this throbbing pain! I'm convinced everytime I wee, I'm reopening that tiny cut!

2022-11-19 04:21:23,68,True,49,"So I (33m) woke up this morning with a nasty headache and found a series of messages from my gf of 8 months that basically boiled down to 'how could you be so awful' and 'we should take some time apart from each other'. I had no idea what was going on and after wracking my memory of the previous night I realised that someone must have spiked my drink at the party I had gone to with my gf. I'm not sure if it was something chemical or just strong proof alcohol that I got (I'm a total light-weight) but I had absolutely no idea what I had said and done.

I spent the morning going back and forth between some of my friends who had been at the party and managed to piece together what had happened. Luckily, I hadn't done anything too embarrassing apart from singing the Titanic song at full volume, but unfortunately I had apparently also decided to do an impromptu stand-up routine where I had been... Honest.

To cut a long story short, I had some bad experiences during my high school/uni years with some bitch queens and later found that I just couldn't function in bed with anyone who I found too pretty. Now, my gf isn't bad looking by any stretch, but I think most guys (and girls if you are into that sort of thing) would probably rate her around 6 on a scale from 1 to 10. I apparently made this very clear to her last night in front of all our friends and suffice to say my gf was NOT pleased.

Hopefully she's going to calm down soon and let me speak to her (she hasn't replied to any of my msgs or calls so far). If she doesn't though, I would welcome any suggestions as to how to appropriately manage the situation.

As far as I know, basically no bodily process is binary; it's all processes with a certain pseudo-random chance to achieve the thing they intend, but failures and freak outliers do occur.

For example, we know that women give birth to one child during a pregnancy. except sometimes, it's two. Or even three (and potentially more?).

So I was wondering, could a similar thing happen, where someone gets pregnant, but a couple weeks later on a sperm cell somehow gets fused with another egg despite that normally not supposed to happen?

Should I bring it up to him at all? And how? I want to be careful with his feelings and his confidence.

2022-03-17 00:13:44,1,True,4,"So, long story short, about 3 years ago I was in the Austrian alps. About 15 years old. I split off my family while snowboarding to ride my own trails. At one point pretty bad winds started and most of the ppl went home. I stayed. Eventually a bad snowstorm and high winds came and I was on the very top of the mountain. I couldn’t see anything and it was very cold. I had to hike down the mountain basically blind. 30-60 minutes later (the memory is a bit fuzzy) I reached the nearest café and eventually got back to the hotel. I thought I would freeze to death or perish in another way. 

This is where the dark thoughts come in. Much more often than I’d like to admit I have wished I didn’t make it off the mountain. I’ve imagined and dreamed about how it would have happened and what could’ve been. I keep coming back to those thought fairly often. Just wishing I didn’t make it off. I’m not 100% certain about why. My guess is that I don’t enjoy my life. The fact is that if someone looked at my life, they’d say it is quite great, but I don’t see it that way for some reason… I just feel like I don’t belong here. Feel like I wasn’t supposed to be here and shouldn’t be.

2022-03-17 00:16:33,1,True,3,"Sorry for the long post. Throwaway account to protect my own privacy. I’ve (19F) been doing a lot of reflecting recently regarding my relationship with my younger brother (17M), and come to the conclusion that while I love him like I do the rest of my family, I don’t like who he is as a person.
Growing up, I always noticed his behaviors were off. The most prominent one I can think of would be that he would never stop touching my butt. I expressed multiple times for him to stop, I told my parents, I’d slap him away, push him away, kick him away, go to another room even, and he never stopped, and my parents didn’t do much about it aside from say, “Ignore him”, or, “He’s only a child”. He did that to me from ages 5-9 (I was 7-11), and it’s only now that I’m processing that it happened. I don’t feel like it’s valid for me to feel this way because we were kids, and he’s younger than me, but I KNOW I was uncomfortable the entire time it was happening, and I know he was taught about boundaries and knew what lines were not meant to be crossed. He saw me in a bra once when I was 13-14 and told me I looked really good in it. All I could think to do was tell him, “Don’t ever say that to me again”. Even now, while he doesn’t do any of that, I always notice him staring at me. He’s done it since we were kids. I’ve asked him to stop, my parents have asked him to stop, hell even my ex asked him to stop because it makes me uncomfortable and I don’t know why he does it. If he’s talking to someone and I’m around he’ll look at me instead of the other person, as if he were talking with me. Anytime he says something he always looks over to me as if he’s judging my reaction, as if he wants to make sure I approve before he keeps speaking. It doesn’t sit right with me. Some of my friends have seen this behavior happen and agree it’s really strange.
Another thing. He was diagnosed with ADHD a long time ago, but this isn’t what bothers me at all. What bothers me is that if he’s not reminded to take his meds, he doesn’t take them, simply because he doesn’t feel like it. I found out once the hard way he hadn’t taken them for three whole days because I asked him to do something and he snapped, began screaming in my face, and nearly escalated to physical violence. Again, my parents didn’t do much, and I was actually forced to apologize to him by a relative that lived with us at the time because “you provoked him”. If any of us ask him to do something, he gets either mad or annoyed, and if that mood change gets pointed out, he’ll snap and begin accusing us of being bossy, rude, etc. If our dog misbehaves, even if it was just her barking at the wrong time, his immediate reaction is to yell at her and hit her hard. Like her doing something that is a basic dog instinct annoys and inconveniences him. I’ve never seen him react to situations like that in any other way; it’s always anger and violence. He’s 17 and doesn’t know how to do the dishes, laundry, cook, clean properly, or do anything that are basic fucking human functions. He does the bare minimum and then just waits for my mom to come and do the job properly because he knows she’ll do it. He doesn’t do anything except stay glued to the electronic of the day (TV, phone, Nintendo Switch, Xbox, tablet). It’s gotten to the point where my mom has had to treat him like a five year old and limit his screen time, because he genuinely doesn’t do anything else, and then he runs to complain to me that our mom is treating him like a child. As if he doesn’t sit and watch Disney Junior shows meant for three year olds at the age of 17. He has no interest in getting a job (“I’ll get confused super easily”), getting his license (“I’ll mess up easily”), and college seems up in the air, considering he wants to go to culinary school and doesn’t even want to try and learn how to properly cook. For years my parents and I have tried to reason with him and explain to him why his behavior is problematic, and give him solutions that will prevent him from getting in trouble yet again, but it goes in one ear and out the other; the last time I tried to just talk to him I asked him a question and he looked at me and asked, “What did you say?”. He wasn’t even listening. We did everything the psychiatrist said. Nothing had an effect. He was tested for every mental illness there was, and the only one that came back positive was the one for ADHD. He doesn’t have anxiety, depression, or anything else.
I love my brother, I really do, but I don’t like the type of person he is. I want to support him in any way I can because I want to see him succeed, but at the same time he is a lazy, unmotivated person who acts like a spoiled five year old child and resorts to anger and violence if someone doesn’t do what he likes. He has no idea how to be properly independent, simply because he chooses not to learn. What he did to me in our childhood is something I’ve been trying to process for years, and it’s only now that I’m realizing the full weight of it.
Sorry for the long rant, it’s been a long week so far. I’m supposed to be on vacation but instead I’m sitting here processing the past 19 years of my life. Thanks for reading I guess.",TrueOffMyChest,"I love my brother, but I don’t like who he is as a person.",2.0,2022-03-17
2022-03-17 00:17:44,3,True,0,"My girlfriend (20f) and I (24m) have been dating for over a year. We were friends for around a year and a half before becoming official. 

Before we began dating, I had my worries that it wasn’t right because she was a bit younger than I and also hadn’t had a serious boyfriend before. I, however, have dated a couple people already (longest relationship is 3 years) and also had my fun being single and one night stands. So, I was skeptical in the beginning but after voicing this she just assures me that she doesn’t want to have that “traditional college experience,” that I mentioned was a root of my worries since I’m graduating soon and she will have 2-3 more years.

So here’s my issue. I love this girl &amp; I really care about her. But ever since moving in, the sexual chemistry is off. It started with me realizing that she tastes like body odor/oniony when I go down &amp; even when sucking nipples. Okay, so what we’re human right? Well, as hard as I try to look past that, it kind of created an awkwardness between us. We’ve moved past it, and she tries to keep as clean as can be. And I feel bad for having these expectations formed from past lovers because I’ve never had a gf that tasted unpleasant. Additionally, she has challenges with climaxing and this leaves me feeling bad after sex sometimes because I don’t feel like I’m fulfilling her. It’s gotten better, especially with a lot of foreplay, but the thought of foreplay after a long day doesn’t sound appealing right now…

Well, it’s gotten to the point where I just masturbate because it solves all of my problems without requiring me to perform and satisfy my partner.  It makes me sad though because I know she craves me but I don’t have the desire/motivation to just grab her and go wild like I’m used to doing with my past lovers.

Something about this just seems like incompatibility but it hurts to come to that conclusion. So lately, I’ve been contemplating moving out when our lease is done. I’ve been planning how it will work out and my reasoning. I’ve been feeling like I just want my girlfriend to go live and experience life. I don’t want to damage her and make her insecure of her body/self just because I feel incompatible. Also, with graduation around the corner, I’m constantly thinking of the future and where I will work, live, etc. And considering that really makes me anxious and not in the mood for sex because my mind is constantly considering if both of us will be happier apart or together. 

I just feel like as the older, more experienced one in the relationship, I feel responsible for protecting her happiness. Like long term happiness, not temporary. She’s so smart and beautiful, I know she deserves everything &amp; I don’t feel ready lately. 

If you actually read this, thank you. Secondly, I’m sorry if it’s chaotic. I have so many complex thoughts and emotions right now that creating a narrative is very hard.

2022-03-21 04:54:26,3,True,4,"(Hello. First I’d like to say I’m still learning how to use Reddit and English is not my first language) 

Me (19f) and my boyfriend (21m) have been together for a few years now and in our first months, we used to have sex all the time. It was a long distance relationship but our sex life was pretty good. 
After a year, he started to get a little awkward whenever I tried to have sex with him. Even a bit defensive, maybe. I can’t say for sure when he stopped wanting to have sex more often, but it’s already been 2 years since I noticed and it has bem killing my self steem since.
With the pandemic in 2020, we started to live in the same city again and we used to see each other a lot. We love doing things together and always had a lot of fun. But our sex life just makes me wants to cry. We used to have sex only at weekends and I know it may sound ok but not to me. First, I really enjoy having sex, specially with him. Second, sometimes I was horny and just wanted to have some casual sex, but if it wasn’t in the weekends or if it was only a few days after we had sex, he wouldn’t care for doing it. Just like… “we already had our weekly sex. You’ll need to wait for another week”
Our worst year was 2021. We were again in a long distance relationship and everytime I tried sexting or sent nudes he would only answer emojis or stickers. It broke me. So I broke up with him (I had more reasons).
Occasionally we got back together and things were muuuuuch better. He was giving me attention again and we were communicating. But the sex, after a while, went cold.
Here I’m now. Staying at his place until I find myself an apartment and I found out something that made me much more confused. It’s a long story but I discovered he was visiting a call girl website last year (by the same time he wouldn’t even care to look at my nudes) and the idea I had in my mind (maybe he wasn’t in his best moment. Maybe I’m a more sexual person than he is) sounds like bullshit now. I talked to him about that and he said it only made him excited, but he never paid for. I believe bc he has no money for that (but I’m not sure if I’d trust him if he had the $) 
Sometimes I ask him to at least make me cum but even that sounds like a loooot. Today is been two weeks since we had sex and I’m very frustrated. I know I’m not ugly and I know I don’t have an ugly body. I tried to make him open up to me because &gt;I know&lt; there might be a reason for why he never touches me. But he just says “I just want to be chill now”.
 I believe I must say this has a great impact on me and my self steem. I see memes or innocent posts about men who have sex with their partners and I can’t help feeling ridiculous, ugly and rejected. Why is it only me the one who can’t be desired? 
He is very sweet to me and always treats my like a princess (I can’t think of a good English word for that) and when we have sex is really good and he is really into it. But the hard part is to make him want to have it. Im totally open about my feelings and recently tried one last time to talk to him and make him understand my feelings, but with every “no” from him I feel even more and more humiliated. 
Sorry for the long text it’s the first time I talk about it.

2022-03-30 22:08:47,9,True,1,"So before I begin, I will state this will all be all off of memory, 

Years ago I met my now fiancé (24f), May 30th will be our five year anniversary of being together. Over the years, I’ve made my fair share of mistakes, arguments, stupid white lies, normal relationship behavior. Before I forgot, I am also 24, before I met her I was the playboy dumbass type, went for the easy girls  because I wasn’t looking for a relationship. My last relationship before I met my now fiancé had a toxic fallout near the end, she was a consistent liar about everything under the sun, yet when it was time to have intercourse it wasn’t a problem. She threw any trust I had given her straight to the trash.

Through the five years I’ve made my stupid mistakes, never physical with my mistakes, being flirtatious and slightly crude, engaging in sexual conversation, I don’t have any excuse why other then impulse, my fiancé is good looking and very respectful, my mistakes are all lesser of her yet I have a draw to them, I have no explanation why I did what I did. These women also ranged in age, one being 21, 24 and 38. 

I myself am a very physical guy, i consistently crave physical affection from my significant other yet she doesn’t do it in a way to “cure the craving”.  I am very vocal about my wants and needs, as is she. We have had hours long conversations about change and understanding one another, yet neither of us have budged 100% to meet one another’s requests. 

I blame my physical crave due from over exposure from previous partners, I’ve fought a long road with pornography exposure as well, teetering between dopamine spikes and lust cravings, I know half of a relationship doesn’t pertain to physical behavior whatsoever, but at the same time I know every relationship has different groundwork. 

We are not an active couple, we both work full time and very odd schedules to try and fix our problems monthly. We have no kids, two dogs (hers) and a mortgage (jumped a lil early imo) our down time after work includes watching TV together occasionally, I’ll game on my PC while she watches TV or works in the kitchen. 

One my questions would be, how can we move forward, being we have two different love languages and show our love differently, is there a way to meet in the middle? 

Is my perception of physical permanently twisted, I have tried different methods at re igniting our list spark, it’ll work only temporarily. 

We haven’t looked at separating seriously up until this point as we just had a lengthy exchange not even a month ago, my problem lies with we have a house between us now and walking away isn’t as easy as it sounds. 

TL:DR
I have different cravings then my significant other, in which I have made piss poor attempts to cure the physical crave with other women and fear I damaged our relationship beyond repair.

2022-03-30 22:28:55,11,True,5,"My husband and I have basically had an open phone policy since we started dating nearly 5 years ago. He has his face ID on my phone and I have mine on his. We share locations. In the beginning I snooped quite a bit- old dating apps, emails, texts. I now occasionally look at texts but never snoop that deeply. He looks through mine occasionally. I think it’s just curiosity at this point.

We’re married with a kid now and I was looking through his photos while nap trapped with the baby. My intention was to look at photos he has of my and the baby. He has just a few albums and I was scrolling through them and found an album with a woman’s picture. When I clicked on it, there were more pictures of this woman including a few naked photos. The dates on all the photos were form before we were dating. I also have seen him scrolling through pictures of attractive women before (on sites like the chive/IG fitness influencers, none he personally knows or anything). 

My instinct is to still be concerned that he has naked pics of an ex still on his phone, however I don’t know if I’m just worrying for nothing if he’s given me access to his phone.

2022-03-31 04:09:10,2,True,1,"So I (21m) really don't know where to begin with this one. There is so much to unpack. 

I'll start off with things that are going good. I'm passionate af about music and my music project is actually starting to get some traction in my local area. Like not in the hundreds but enough to make me happy. I have multiple gigs lined up, a music video ready and things are looking like they are about to take off. 

I have been accepted into my university course! I'll be studying physics starting September. 

I've met a girl that I am in LOVE with. That may be a bit too far but we're talking every day on Snapchat and I'm meeting her in 2 weeks for our first date. She seems really interested and I really want to treat her right yakno? 

Oh I have friends! Lots of friends that I can actually say I'm close to. I haven't had that properly since year 9 in secondary school (I think that's middle school for Americans idk). 

Also, growing in a single parent household, I never met most of my Dad's family. We went over to Turkey for my 21st and I met the rest of my family. They're all such lovely people, apart from my dad but we'll get to that. 

So from this alone my life is going how I've always dreamed it'd go. However it always feels like life has to throw curveballs whenever something goes right. 

In fact I think it's primarily just 2 HUGE problem.

So this is a sexual problem that I have been having for a few months. This gets pretty Pg so tw from here I suppose.

 It all started where one night about December last year where I was masterbating. I had been trying to quit porn for a while and before I came I decided ""actually this isn't a good idea"" and didn't let myself finish. So I just put everything back and carried on as normal. Suddenly I felt this horrible pain in my testicle and I mean REALLY bad. 

I had a ring in my ear and it felt like I was going to faint. (Fyi I have fainted before and I got the exact same ring in my ear). After I managed to get ahold of myself a bit, I decided to try to sit down and calm down. However sitting down was extremely uncomfortable. The only way I could get comfy was by sitting at the edge of the chair and doing some extreme manspreading. I decided I didn't want to risk it being testicular torsion so I went to the hospital after awkwardly explaining the situation to my poor mum. 

The doctor examined me and determined nothing was wrong. They sent me off home but told me to come back if I get the pain again. Well one night I got the pain again but decided not to go to the hospital because I didn't want to waste the doctor's time. So I just slept through all the pain I felt in my pelvis and balls. I really don't know how I did that. 

Anyway since then I haven't had that same extreme pain but I have had a horrible amount of uncomfyness in both of my testicles. Like the pain kind of swaps around. I can't sleep some nights because of it, however taking ibuprofen seems to help. Only had to do it twice. 

I've done std checks and they've come back clear. The clinic told me to go to my gp about my testicle pain. I went to the GP today, he inspected my testicles which was again awkward af, however he couldn't find any swelling anything. Which should be good right? But it's not because I have absolutely no idea where the pain is coming from. To make matters worse the fact I took ibuprofen the night before I went to see the doctor made it so the pain was not as bad so I found it hard to describe everything to him. 

He asked if I think that it could be all in my head as I have sensitive testicles and I have anxiety about my down below problems. He offered an ultrasound scan after saying that but I kinda felt like he was calling me a liar so I took the option of wait and see what happens, but now I'm having second thoughts that it might have been the wrong choice. Btw I'm not saying it was the doctor's fault, but i'm just saying how it influenced my decision.

I have felt extremely anxious about it all day, i've been trying to calm myself down but I'm finding it so hard. To make matters worse I was masterbating earlier and I literally couldn't cum. I could like orgasm almost but not cum. That has never happened to me before but I'm wondering if it is just the stress and anxiety causing that. I want kids in the future and I'm really scared that it is something serious :( 

There isn't even pain, I just literally can't ejaculate. This raised my anxiety tenfold so I made myself a cup of tea and sat in the dark trying to calm myself down 😭

As for the second issue, it has to do with my dad. I mentioned earlier that he Is evil. I can't describe exactly why because it makes me sick but I can't go into more detail than that.

Anyway i'm going to keep this issue short but basically my dad is evil but the rest of my family are really nice. I have a little 3yo brother over there who I want to be able to see often  but each time I would want to see him I'd have to see my dad. Which would just make me angry and upset. It is 100% more deep than that but I've honestly been writing this for about an hour and a half now so I gotta cap it off. 

Anyway it's just kind of funny because these problems are really interfering with the things that are going right in my life. Like for example the ball problem is making me lose confidence and is making me anxious what the girl I'm talking to is going to think when I eventually have to tell her. 

I almost feel like it is god's/ the universe's way of punishing me for my wrongdoings. Like I'm agnostic but I lean a bit more towards being an atheist. Still whenever life throws all these problems at me at once I can't help but feel like it is what I deserve. 

It is currently 5am so I'm struggling to continue writing but I feel like I got most of it ya kno ... Off my chest

2022-03-31 04:09:20,7,True,1,"This is long, and may be cross posted, but if you stick around I would really love some advice or opinions on my decisions.

I was engaged to my highschool love after dating for six years. He was my best friend and absolutely everything to me. Then he started to become mean, Verbally abusive, and controlling. 
 
When I suggested couples therapy he yelled at me and took the ring back and said we were going to go back to just dating. He started smoking a lot of weed and keeping secrets from me. He lied about doing well in college, with his finances, at his job. He would come home and yell at me until I cried at least once a week and now I can’t even remember why. I felt like I was the one at fault, like if I wasn’t alive then he wouldn’t be so upset. 

There are a million reasons why I should’ve broken up with him and I didn’t. 
Until…
I started talking to my cousin again. She and I didn’t meet until I was around 16 because she lived in another country, and when we did meet we became friends quickly. After a while of being friends we both went to college and stopped talking as much.

When my Fiancé started to act that way towards me, she was the only one who listened. She listened and supported me and got me out of the cycle of blaming myself and feeling suicidal. 
We also started a book club and spent days sending eachother poems and book excerpts. My fiancé always hated that I spent so much time reading, so it was so refreshing and fun to have someone to talk to, not only about the shitty parts of my life, but the things I loved too. We sent pictures to eachother for weeks, of our lives, of the small things that made us happy that day, trees, birds, a funny sign or bumper sticker. 
She encouraged me with my schooling, encouraged my art, asked me to sing for her. 
After a while I was spending far more time with my cousin than my fiancé because he was treating me like shit and she was keeping me alive. 

I fell in love with her.

I didn’t want to. I wasn’t expecting it at all. I didn’t even really figure out that that was why I wanted to be around her all the time until later. 


I went and stayed at her place for a sleepover, drove four hours to visit her and to get away from everything at home. She really opened up to me about the fears and regrets in her life, how she was scared of the future. She was crying and we were talking and then my Fiancé called, angry that I hadn’t texted him in a few hours. 

My cousin got very upset that our very raw and deep conversation was interrupted for something so inane, and by someone that was treating my badly. While I was calming my fiancé down she decided to go up to bed because she was very upset that I had picked up the phone rather than continue talking to her. (Reasonable as it was around 11:30pm and it was rude of me) 

After I got off the phone I went up to her bedroom and knocked on her door, went in to apologize. She was crying, very upset and stressed that I hadn’t ended this relationship that was hurting me. I crawled into bed with her and we cried together for a few minutes. Her head on my chest and my face in her hair. It was so intimate and emotional and freeing. I had never felt that emotionally close to anyone in my life before. 

Then she went to reach for a box of tissues because we both really needed them, and accidentally brushed her hand across my chest. She immediately apologized and then got very very upset, started crying very hard and was unable to explain. 
I told her it was fine, it was an accident, that it didn’t matter to me. But she was still so upset and couldn’t get words out. 

Eventually she confessed that she had been having confusing romantic feelings for me and that she was terrified that it would ruin our friendship. She told me how much she treasured me and the friendship we had made together and that she didn’t want it to stop, but didn’t want to break her own heart by watching me marry someone who was so terrible for me. 

She said she had been thinking of kissing me and I confessed to the same, we sortof laughed about it for a bit saying like “well, our hormones just don’t care that we are related lol, can’t help who you’re attracted to” 

Eventually the tension just grew too high and we ended up saying basically “well, we both know we are going to kiss sooner or later, why not get it out of our systems” 

So we did. And it was magic. It was like taking a breath of fresh air after being on the brink of suffocation, like blinking into the light after years of darkness. We meant it to just be a short peck but one thing led to another and I was straddling her, my hands in her hair and my lips on hers. 

We took it farther. But I won’t go into detail. 

After that, we both went to bed in separate rooms saying we were glad we had done it to get it out of our systems. That I didn’t have to tell my fiancé because it was harmless and wouldn’t happen again. 

Then the next morning we realized that wasn’t true. We went for a hike together and when we reached the top of the mountain, we kissed again. And I was lost. All I wanted was her. 

For a few weeks after those two days, we were seeing eachother in secret. Always saying it was the last time. Then, we realized it wasn’t just attraction. It was love, love like I had never felt in my life. Not even with the man I was meant to marry. I had to tell him.

Before I could, one of the friends I had confided in took it upon herself to tell him for me. 

He told my parents, and they told my cousins parents, and everyone hated us. 

My relationship with him was ended, but the fallout lasted months as he dragged his feet in moving out and continually abused me and kept begging for me to take him back. It hurt so much. 

My cousin and I were still in contact and she supported me through those awful months and we continued to see eachother, keeping it secret from everyone. 

Now he has finally moved out, and I am back home with my parents. But I am still seeing her. 

I am in love with her and wish I could be with her every moment, even ten months later. 

It would destroy my family if they found out I had lied to them and continued to see her. My entire life would implode. My sister would hate me. 

I love her and I want to be with her.

2022-03-31 04:16:46,0,True,3,"when I was around 3 or 4 (my cousin was around 6 or 7) my cousin raped me.

          I lived in a big yellow house with big windows and chains near the front door. The main area me and my cousin hung out around was downstairs where the kitchen and living room were connected. We would frequently sleep in that living room space and have fun watching movies.

                         But one night when my aunt (his mom) was sleeping he went onto the tv in the living room (the tv was around 75 inches or more wide) and decided to watch p*rn with me. After about 2 hours of that he decided to imitate it onto me. I don’t know if that would be considered rape but I think it was. I was pretty dumb so I didn’t really have a say in it. For those who don’t want any detail of what happened DON’T continue reading and move onto something else.




YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED:

He performed anal sex with me then made me suck on his p*nis and peed in my mouth.
I threw the pee up, my aunt was still somehow sleeping after hearing me choke and vomit for a couple seconds. I decided I didn’t wanna do it anymore so I went back to sleep on the floor, where he then raped me again. 6 years (in these events I was 10) later my other cousin (9) decided to perform anal sex on me again in our religious grandparents bed. He got caught by them trying to see my little brothers penis (4).

The last time I was raped was when I was 10, like in the last paragraph. My cousin Brayden (12 at the time) tried to rape me in the bedroom of his house. Later he got caught trying to pull my pants down while I was sleeping. And I can’t tell my family members about the first rape because the cousin is in deep shit now. He’s doing drugs, stealing things, and stole his friends gun. He’s landed himself in probation a bunch of times and I feel that my family members will despise me if I tell them about what happened that night because my cousin is already going through a lot.

Today after the bar we were feeling super hot and I’m bisexual so part of the conversations we had in the car were that both of us had checked out the hot lady bartender while we were at the bar. We decided to put on some lesbian porn and bang it out. We were extremely loud and had the tv with the porn on full blast for cinematic affect. A few hours later, my bf approached me and asked if I opened the window after we had sex. I told him I opened the window this morning. Little did we know, the window was wide open the entire time.

He knows somewhat, I haven't out right said "" hey I pulled dude in the bathroom and gave him some nana. He liked it so much that he came back 3 times, before I got annoyed of him thinking he could hump me into his life forever and ever.""
He hasn't outright asked either. Our neighborhood is a rabbit hole, for a big city, it's so small as far as people go. I'lm sure he's heard something. He's mentioned dude in question in a suggestive type way, and I just shrugged and said ""get it how your living, I learn from the best"" *wink* I WOULD NEVER LIE TO HIM, because if it's something I'd be too scared to admit, I'm not doing it because I know I'm a terrible liar. But this is just the intro...............

Little backstory: my man and I been living together 4 years. At beginning of our relationship/shit he would treat me like trash. If I asked him why he was treating me poorly, his response was always something along the lines of: "" well I wouldn't be such an asshole if you would have gotten me off earlier in the day."" Yes, I'm serious. I think that he's never been in a relationship before where he could communicate openly and honestly without fear of judgement. Please believe me, if he would have asked me for it, I would have jumped on that like sugarhill gang. In 4 years he's cheated on me a ton. He always tries to hide it, but I'm not brand new. I'm chill, I brought a girl home for a threesome after first time he cheated. I was trying to make it so he didn't have to step out. I asked him first, before I brought her in , and he said he wanted to. After the fact he says we ""borderline raped him and forced it on him."" (I'm 31/f/5'0/105lbs he's double my size) ff: we haven't had sex in like six months. I go down on him 1, maybe 2 times a day. Ive asked him for sex, but he just doesn't get around to it. Then I found out he cheated on me again , in the worst way possible. See if u can guess based on information already in play. :(

So I know this guy that's friends with a few of my friends. We were kind of flirting. One night I was so sexually frustrated I quite literally shoved him into the hall bathroom at our friends. Over the next 2 weeks I saw him over there a few more times while I was picking up my 🐱.( My friends house that I see him at is also my cat sitter while I'm working. ) We hooked up a couple of those times. UNTIL- DUDE DECIDED THAT HE WAS GOING TO TAKE THE CONDOM OFF IN THE MIDDLE ALL SNEAKY AND FINISH INSIDE OF ME. I stopped talking to him because he started getting creepy trying to wife me, even though he knows about my bf. 

Me and my dude go through stuff, we get over it, and we make it work for our pitbull. That sounds pathetic but it's true. We had a baby a little over a year ago. We weren't in a place financially for it to be feasible. Someone in my family can't have kids, I asked if they wanted to adopt,  they absolutely have the cutest family now. Everyone was happy. Until ......now I'm a week late for my cycle. My cycle is irregular. But I'm very very nervous, the stress is probably making it worse.  That's why I needed to get this off my chest. I cannot be pregnant with the eventual weirdos baby. My dude will know it's not his, because of how we went through it so recently he wouldn't ever be that careless again. :'( (the guy is really a creep. I can't afford an abortion.

My (22F) boyfriend John (23M) doesn't want to have sex even after we've been together for a year. 

John was raised in a religious household that instilled the ten commandments into their children. He is not as religious as his family but he still holds most of their values.

I was raised in a pretty secular family, religion was not even a topic in my family. I could basically do what I wanted (within reason ofc) and had a lot of freedom. 

John is the sweetest guy and we do plenty of romantic things but the most we'd do was kissing. I really feel like I'm missing out, my friends all have boyfriends with which they sleep with. I kinda get teased by them for not having slept with John.

So, I recently confronted John about this and he just looked at me for a few seconds before speaking up. He said that a relationship should be able to survive without sex and that he wants to wait until marriage. After his response I asked him what he counts as sex and he meant that basically anything to do with genitalia is off limits until we get married.

What should I do? Should I just wait like he wants me too? Should I push the issue? Should I even attempt to change his mind?

2022-04-13 00:04:10,23,True,0,"This one is a big one, I'm screwed. **I need some wise advice.** It's not uncommon for me to match with mildly famous people, I guess it's a pretty privilege. So I wasn't too surprised. However I have some massive anxiety about this situation.

**Pre-curser:** My partner of 4 years is gone for 8 months out of the year. We live together and have a successful relationship. We make this work by having a non-monogamous relationship with restrictions.

**INFO:** I was on a dating platform and there was this guy that was super handsome so I liked him. We matched and his account was verified. I asked for his number, and we started talking on the phone.

He was telling me about his career and said ""I assume you've seen me on XYZ show"". I was like ""???????"". He told me to google him and so I did. He was the real deal, and to solidify that he was the real deal I asked for very specific dick pics with his full body and face included. He provided that....and more... and I was pretty happy.  I even went to his verified Instagram and told him to message me on there with a specific message so I knew I wasn't getting catfished. **Behold I was blessed with the real guy.**

It seemed like this was going to be a perfect setup. He knew about my partner and how he'll always come first. He understands that he will not be my priority and I want nothing more than a sexual partner to fill my needs. *This man is absurdly beautiful and well kept... even for his age. He also has one of the prettiest cocks I've ever seen.* He said that it works perfectly because of his TV film schedule stuff and all of that.  We agreed on keeping our sexual dynamic between us so I don't harm his career and I don't harm my partners career and reputation since we're not open with other people about our relationship style.

**Anyways, we've been talking for over a week now and we were planning on hooking up..** ***until*** **he started giving me some BIG RED FLAGS(?)**

**ISSUE:**

He started to get pretty vulnerable with me. He told me that when he was a kid, he had been arrested for more than a few things. I didn't think too much of that. I asked what it was and he avoided successfully telling me. Then he tells me that since he's such a big guy, people tend to be scared of him, and scared of confronting him. He said he didn't like that and he's pretty open to communicating. I believed that, he's a massive man who looks a bit intimidating. He also asked if he'd be open to filming me while we have sex. I politely declined... this wasn't the first time a guy has asked me this so I wasn't offended. Next, he tells me he's used steroids before for some of his TV related things, I understood that because unfortunately it's not uncommon in the industry. I asked if he was still using and he said no. I asked if he has kids and he said he has more than a few different kids around the world, but said he pays child support so it's fine... ???

The kid thing was kind of a red flag for me because he talked a lot about wanting to fill me up with his cum and *""take daddys seed and forever have a part of him""*. Before I knew the kid thing, I found that hot. But now I'm wondering if **he meant actually getting me pregnant??**

**Then** we were talking on the phone and I heard some noises in the background and I asked what he was up to. He told me he was taking a drug. The drug was a date rape drug so he could sleep better tonight. I thought that was kind of a huge red flag that he had access to date rape drugs in the first place, but he said it's not so common in the US but it is in Europe?

I was like huh, whatever and we started having phone sex again. He was kinda out of it and after he came I legit thought he was in the process of dying because of the gasping I heard, then the silence for 10 mins on the phone... luckily he texted me an hour later. It was complete gibberish but at least I knew he wasn't dead. He apologized in the morning for taking too much of the drug and I kinda felt bad for him so I told him everything was okay and that I'm still attracted to him. Which isn't a lie.. I went on his instagram and started liking his story for the day and telling him how hot he is and all of that to simpingly show him that I still care about him.

Even with these red flags he's so fucking hot I can't think straight. I don't know why I'm being so dumb about this. I don't even know if there's a safe way to engage with him. I know in the celebrity world there's unfortunately a lot of drug use, and I have empathies for him. It's weird.

He seems like the perfect sexual fit for me, and I don't know if I should cut contact or what but I defiantly feel like I'd be missing out if I did.

I need help processing this big one reddit.

But since then he hasn’t wanted to have sex with me and when we do it, it doesn’t feel intimate on my side but he says he feels that way. I rarely orgasm bc I can’t orgasm with just penetration and he says it’s more work to give me one and that I take forever. I thought we worked through that issue but sometimes he just forgets ig bc he’s too focused on not nutting. We barley do anything sexual and he doesn’t even make out with me it’s always just a kiss. While having sex we never kiss either and it feels too vanilla to me and he says I ruined myself from watching porn as a kid and that it takes more for me to feel something. In a argument about it he said it takes 1000 ppl to pleasure me. In this same conversation he told me that he doesn’t like being sexual and that he doesn’t feel good nutting bc he has to pull out and that being sexual ruins a relationship and I think since he had sex with another girl without feeling feelings for her that it ruined his perception on sex, sex to me is something spiritual and connects you to the other person. Sex is something you enjoy and should want to do with your partner and it should make you feel closer. I’ve told him I like having sex or having an orgasm everyday to make me feel at peace and since he doesn’t care for it that maybe I should get a dildo and he flipped out. I feel like I can’t win here and I feel very sexually frustrated, I’ve told him all of this too. It feels deeper to me then what he tells me bc I don’t feel like I’m being desired of that he even loves me bc he barley ever says that too. He has very bad anxiety and it makes it hard for him to be sexual which is very understandable so I told him he doesn’t have to have sex with me but to just give me an orgasm but he declined, I don’t like touching myself either.

2022-04-24 09:00:31,13,True,25,"A while ago I made a comment where I briefly mentioned my Grandpa.  I can’t remember the exact context in which it came up on a post or anything but, I remember commenting about my Grandpa stabbing a boy on his school bus with an ice pick for flicking his ears.  IIRC I believe the post had to do with something about bullying.  

I started getting a shit-ton of people saying that I should take one of those dna ancestry test things in case my Grandpa has murdered someone.  I remember brushing everyone off because I just couldn’t see my Grandfather ever hurting anyone like that but, the more I think about it the more I worry it could be possible.

I’ll elaborate on what made me start to really think about it.

My Grandfather and Grandmother are about 10-12 years apart in age.  They’ve known eachother since my Grandmother was a toddler which is pretty gross.  My Grandmother told me about how he used to carry her on his shoulders whilst he was dating her older sister and looked at her as the younger annoying sibling for who kept getting in the way.  Somehow when she got older they became a couple instead.

Anyway, my grandma told me the story of how my grandpa was getting bullied each day on the bus.  The older kids would sit behind him and flick his ears.  He has large ears and the kids would insult him for them and flick and pull them.  After awhile of this he’d had enough and brought an ice-pick to school and as soon as one of the older kids sat behind him he turned around and stabbed him in the knee with it.  The kid had to go to the ER and changed schools because of it.

I chalked this up to being a kid thing to do but, others on Reddit saw it as overkill which, considering everything else i am about to tell you, makes sense.

I’ll give you a bit of a backstory on his life and why I’m confused about him.

He was extremely poor growing up.  My grandpa was one of 5 boys and 1 girl.  The 5 boys shared one room and when it rained they’d sleep under their beds to avoid getting wet.  All 5 boys shared a queen sized bed and the one girl had her own.  His mother would wake him and his brothers up by striking them with a leather belt.  My grandpa always laughs when recalling this, saying “We were always getting ourselves into trouble so she’d beat us each morning knowing we’d get ourselves into trouble later that day anyway.”

He had a habit of killing the stray cats that roamed around their land.  He would catch them, tie them up, sling them around, kick them, and a few times he’d ran them over with a tractor.  He’d tell these stories laughing, too. My grandmother laughed and reminisced about those times as well.  He said he’d gotten caught once because his father noticed that there was a small dirt mound next to a flat patch of dirt with little hand prints patted into it.  He asked my grandpa what it was and he told him he accidentally hit the cat while driving the tractor so he buried it to “be respectful”.  His father didn’t believe him as my grandpa was acting suspicious and pressed the issue and my grandpa told him what he did was actually on purpose so, he got a beating.  Cats still kept getting killed by him and each time he’d get beaten ‘til his buttocks were bruised and yet he still killed and tortured them.

This wasn’t the only time he hurt something/someone for no reason.  He’d gotten himself and his friends into trouble for tying up an autistic boy to a tree and setting a nearby barn on fire.  The boy had been out there all night long and the only reason he wasn’t left to die was because the fire from the barn spread out into the woods where he was and the firefighters were called to put it out.  They found the boy covered in bug bites, his own urine and feces, and bruises.  My grandfather never got into any trouble with the law for it as his mother covered for him and said he was in bed sick all day.

My grandfather was in the navy and has a war injury where he stepped on a land mine.  He’s always been quiet about what he experienced in war but, anytime I saw his foot as a kid I had to ask what happened and he’d answer very matter-of-fact.  My mother has told me a story about when she first met him, she was walking past him in the laundry room of my grandmothers house and he suddenly pinned her to the wall, got close to her face, and just stared at her in silence.  My mother said it shook her to her core as my grandpa is a normally goofy, quiet, kind person.  He tells the worst jokes non-stop, walks around the house making silly noises, and is rarely angry.  She says his eyes changed that day and she felt like he was going to hit her.  He let her go and she didn’t say a word about it as she was so caught of guard and confused as to why it happened. 

When I think back to my childhod, I remember those eyes.  Only a few times have I ever seen them.  Once when my sister who was 6 at the time was refusing to go to bed.  My grandmother was spanking her and suddenly my grandpa who usually stuck to himself in the den watching either Gold or a Poker tournament rushed into the bedroom, lifted her by her shirt, slammed/pinned her to the wall and looked her deep in the eyes and said eerily calmly compared to his violent entrance, “Go to sleep or I will really give you something to cry about”.

I don’t now whether or not to think my Grandfather is a psychopathic person or a person with PTSD due to his rough upbringing and war.  He has killed during combat but, I guess it’s just hard to think of your own family being a possible murderer.  Of course we don’t know if he actually has harmed anyone with the intent to end their lives outside of the war.

I know that he has had horrible parents and I almost wonder if it’s something that is passed down genetically as my father has extreme anger issues and was very abusive to my mother and all of my siblings.  My father has given my mother a black eye when she was pregnant with me and he’s done things to deliberately hurt people seemingly for fun.  He’s notorious for making jokes and pulling pranks that are either painful, dangerous, cruel or mean-spirited.

I don’t know.  The mystery of my family has been something that baffles me and surprises me each time I think about it.

At the beginning of our relationship this wasn’t a problem and we would get intimate every time we saw each other, but had not yet slept with each other. The first time we tried I asked him to stop as I wasn’t comfortable but explained to him that it just wasn’t the right time for me and we would get there. Since then we have had no form of physical intimacy and there has been no signs of it returning. I know it needs to be discussed between us so we can just get on the same page but I’m unsure how to bring it up in a way that won’t be uncomfortable or seem like I’m pushing him. Would love some advice on how to raise the topic!

2022-05-31 04:36:20,2,True,0,"I (31 F) am in a relationship with a 34 (M). My bf is on the spectrum and we just found out. I’m not on the spectrum, but to show support I decided to start reading and understanding his diagnosis more. I have ADHD so I understand some of his habits. He is more sensitive and I’m more analytical. A lot of issues that I’ve had now make sense. For example he doesn’t like to text and he’s very picky about things like washing hands or having things in a certain way. I guess asking him to ask how I’m doing during the week when we are a part is too much to ask for. We’ve been dating for 8.5 months now. I do a lot for this man (not that I keep tabs,) but out of the blue he told me he didn’t love me, just likes me, &amp; that he doesn’t feel love from me. We’ve never said I love you so this was extremely painful to hear. However, he thinks he could get there. Now all we do is fight and I seriously think he does it on purpose sometimes at this point. For example, he told me he wants me to take charge, just do things, nurturing &amp; be more thoughtful. (It’s funny though because my closet people say that nurturing is my strongest strength which is why I don’t understand this.) So I asked him what he was feeling like for dinner after this conversation and just ordered it that night without anymore consulting. He’s going to school and finals were happening. I thought it would be a thoughtful gesture since he was stressed with finals. He decides to get mad because I just ordered food. I also forgot the bread even though we had some in the freezer. He couldn’t see that I did it out of love and I thought it would  be one less thing for him to worry about. Instead he took it as me not being considerate or caring. His perception of my intentions &amp; who I am feel real distorted at this point. He says I can be angry and mean, which is something I’ve never been described as before.

Another issue I have is he says one thing but wants the opposite. Last weekend he said we spend too much time together. So I packed my stuff up and he had the nerve to ask why I was leaving. Or he’ll talk about our future and the next minute he shuts it down. This is a constant thing. 

When we argue he uses his “autism” as the problem &amp; doesn’t want to meet me in the middle. I’m told constantly that I shouldn’t trust him (I know he isn’t cheating,) but it still hurts that he doesn’t think we should  trust each other. 

 I have given him plenty of outs, but he wants to work on things. I have that mindset of I choose you to be in my life &amp; I won’t beg a man to stay, which I told him this on numerous occasions. We both are in therapy and are working on our individual issues. We both also have a rule about open communication. However, since he said he doesn’t love me or feels love for me I’ve taken a step back. Are relationships with people who are on the spectrum this rocky? Does it get any better? Because at this point I feel unloved, unwanted, &amp; am having concerns. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells &amp; my anxiety is through the roof. My end goal is to have a family &amp; to be settled down. To share a loving life with someone. How can I get us to be on a better road? Or is this just pointless?

2022-06-14 21:31:47,8,True,0,"Quick disclaimer: The opinions shared in this post do not impose any notion of homophopia on anyone, nor does it condone it. I am merely sharing my own thoughts and my experience with same-sex relationships and their personal effect on me.

I will quickly cut to the chase - I am a 26-year-old man, living the job of my dreams, and very grateful that I am doing financially very well. Always believed that I am heterosexual, but things changed after experiencing some intimate sexual action from someone of the same sex during college. I started craving men after that, more than I ever imagined, I still crave women as well, but my craving for being in a relationship with a man was always stronger. Perhaps it was because the first sexual experience I ever lived through was with a man, or perhaps it's because I never had any intimate experience with a woman, I don't know. I dated 2 guys during college for a very short period of time, things usually degraded quickly when sex was about to get involved and I felt that what I am doing is wrong, sinful, and sacrilegious. My last ever relationship was during my senior year of college 4 years ago, and it ended due to the same reason in which I didn't feel what I was doing was right.

Fast forward 4 years later, I haven't gotten into any other relationship after college and despite doing very well in my career (and I am beyond grateful for that) ever since I graduated from college I felt more lonely than ever. Always longing for a partner to share my moments with and simply to feel the physical touch of someone, and always feeling empty despite having a decent friend group inside and outside work. A year ago, I came to the realization that perhaps I am paying for my sins during college and that I need to get rid of my gay tendencies if I were to ever find love and peace. I've been trying to stop watching gay porn since then, reading stories about people who successfully ""healed"" themselves and became heterosexual and got rid of their gay tendencies, forcing myself to watch straight porn (or even masturbating without watching porn altogether) when feeling that my gay tendencies are spiking again. I am not quite sure if what I am doing is right or wrong, I am not quite sure if being gay is right or wrong, and I am not sure if suppressing my gay desires will ever get me anywhere, but all I can do is have some faith in the process.

I know that some people will find some of the things mentioned above very homophobic or perhaps maybe ignorant, but I genuinely don't know what's right or wrong and I surely won't ever judge someone for being gay or look at them differently, it's just that I can't accept myself and I am not even sure if it's not accepting myself is the problem here. I come from an extremely conservative family, and simply deciding that being gay is natural isn't an easy option for me to digest, especially since I never had these strong gay tendencies before being exposed to a relationship with a man.

The fuck up happened on  F2 birthday, me and F1 decided to surprise F2 with a wine so I told him to buy it before we went out to celebrate.

So we go out, we say happy birthday to F2 and give him our present, the wine. We started drinking the wine and it was awful and I questioned F1 what kind of wine did he purchased. Well it turns out that he bought a 2l bottle of red wine for 20 leu(which is about 4 dollars). I didn't want the wine to go to waste, so I drank most of the wine (about 1,5l). After drinking the wine, we went to a pizza place and ate pizza and drank beer. We stayed out till 11:00 pm. I got home at about 11:15 pm. I didn't feel dizzy and didn't need to vomit so I went to bed at around 11:30 pm. At around 12:30 I woke up because I needed to vomit really badly, so I ran to the bathroom. The bathroom is pretty small (2 meters wide, 3 meters long and 2.3 meters high),when you enter the bathroom on your right there is a washing machine and right after it there is the toilet. Now when I entered the bathroom, I couldn't hold the vomit in any longer and started to vomit into the washing machine, I somehow managed to turn my head towards the toilet and leaned down. Now this is where the real fuck up happened, as so much vomit came out of my body with such force that the toilet couldn't handle it and vomit got everywhere and I mean it, all of the bathroom was covered in vomit, even  the ceiling, from knee down I had vomit on my legs and I was stepping into my own vomit.

It took me 2 hours to clean the mess. So the moral of the story is that you shouldn't drink 1,5l of cheap wine.

Now a few days pass and me and jeff keeps butting in on our conversations. Gerald gets annoyed and the conversation follows

Gerald: piss off we're not talking to you

Jeff: yes I'm talking to you so we are talking

Gerald: no that's not how it works

(jeff gets mad and walks off)

me and Gerald think that's the end of it and go back to talking. 5 minutes later  jeff comes back with a giant branch that's like 3/4s his size and starts chasing us

the next day he ignores us and is on his Chromebook me and Gerald get an idea and try to pull the ol lock button prank but when I walk up to him before I can do anything he stabs me in the shoulder with a pencil causing me to collapse and start crying (shit hurt)

now a few days pass and I forget how but we become friends (for some dumb reason)

days pass and we think he gets better (Gerald doesn't like him still)

Some time passes and Jeff starts going back to his old self and I get Covid (I'm fine now)

while I'm out I'm told by many people that Jeff got suspended for a week and for stealing from a book fair when I confront jeff he says he did and displays it like a trophy that's not even the worst thing

now I will give Jeff some credit he can draw but with great power comes great responsibility and boy jeff does not use his power for good jeff draws p0rn yes p0rn and I don't care draw that shit if you like but he brings his notebook filled with p0rn and shows it to people. some kids are grossed out

My [25M] girlfriend [26F] is amazing. We get along extremely well, which isn't hard because I'm a people pleaser who is very agreeable and so is she. Besides that we never fight, we always have a good time together, I trust her, I feel secure with her, and I could see a safe future with her. 

I want to stress that this is a me issue. Nothing is objectively wrong with her. She's amazing. And I love her very much. We've been together for 4 years and it's about that time... but I have a very hard time seeing myself getting married to her. She talks about it all the time and then apologizes because she knows I get uncomfortable. 

I feel like an asshole because I know that she's great. I just feel like sometimes I'm not as attracted to her as I should be. I find myself with the wandering eye at times and I feel awful for seeing women in public who I think are more attractive than her. I know attraction isn't everything, and in 40 years it will be the last thing on our minds. I've tried and tried and I can't stop developing stupid little crushes on people around me. Does that mean that I don't really love her? 

There are some things about her, physically, that she can not change, and it makes it so that I'm less sexually attracted to her. I'm not, not attracted to her at all, I just have to be really in the mood for anything to happen. She rarely is in the mood as well due to medication. I feel like such a douchebag typing all that out.

Sometimes the love I have for her feels less romantic and more like she's my close friend roomate? Sometimes it's very romantic like after two beers or a glass of wine I realize she's my muse.

I also really like to be alone. Sometimes I feel like if she moved away and we did long distance I would almost be happier...

I know about the 80/20 rule and if I had to be honest I'm like, 70/30 at this point.

2022-07-20 23:13:08,95,True,346,"This post may be quite long, I apologise, but I just want to give as much perspective and context as I can.

To give the required info, we've been dating for 9 months now

Let me take you back to the start of the relationship. We met online and were friends for about a full year before we admitted that we were into each other, she is from my country and was studying abroad at the time.

We became very close during the first 2 months of our relationship, voice or video calling every day. After this I decided to book a plane ticket to come see her which she agreed on. It was for 10 days if I remember correctly and both of us had a great time while I was there. I would go on to go again for a further 2 weeks in February of this year, and similarly I had a great time.

It got to a point in our relationship where she wanted to move back to my country to be closer to me, and she quit university over in the country she was studying in. She told me she had enrolled in one of the universities in the capital city, and that she had a place that she used to live in, and that we could live together there

Now this place is quite the upscale place, I'm talking a palace of a penthouse. She would talk a lot about what it was like and despite me being in understandable disbelief over the fact that her supposedly rich parents would pass a property like that down to her, she always maintained that she owned it...

Well that was until about 2 months ago, when I questioned her again, just to make sure, as we were set to move in a month from that time, and she dropped the bomb that she didn't own it, in fact, it had always been under her mothers name, who had sold it 3 months prior. Understandably I was very upset not only that my dream of living with the person I love had just evaporated in front of my eyes, but also that she had lied to me so needlessly for 3 whole months even while we talked about how great it's gonna be living together.

What makes this stranger is when she supposedly flew back to this country and brought all her things (no, I couldn't be there at the airport to check if this was true, in fact when I asked to come meet her there she wasn't fussed on me coming which was out of character) she went on to stay in a hotel for two weeks while I came down to visit her, saying that she was having work done on the flat to supposedly expand what would be her bedroom, but as I just said none of this was true and her being in this hotel caused me to call her out on it in a firm manner, causing her to admit it.

This was the first lie, and I'm willing to let this slide, as I recovered from this and told her that we can find another way of living together, although it should be noted that in the lead up to our supposed ""move in date"" I quit my job and my local university to be able to move down there, and she let me do those things without stopping me under false pretences, which has utterly screwed me, but that's not for this post.

Then about a month ago, she was supposedly staying with her father who is living in Paris at the moment. One day my mother asks me if she had sent me any pictures from the city, any identifying features, but it occurred to me that she hadn't. So I asked her to send a selfie, and she would give an excuse for any solution to do this that I gave her.

Bet you can guess where this is going, she told me that she had actually been in my country for 3 days by that point, but honestly given that this was the second time that she lied to me, I honestly believe that she was never there in the first place, and that this was simply an excuse as to why I can't be there with her in person, for whatever reason, I am desperate to find out.

This is where things take a quite the turn

So around 5 days ago, I woke up to my phone buzzing, and by the time I was fully conscious, the caller began calling me again, so I picked up and said hello, to which a young male voice with an accent from my country and an A**ustralian** phone number said something to the effect of something very bad happened to my girlfriend, then hung up before I could answer. This was at midday-ish, and my girlfriend is usually asleep until the mid afternoon almost evening, so I messaged her instantly asking for her to respond as soon as she sees the message, and sat waiting in limbo for hours, until eventually in the evening she sent me the money on a certain payment service app that she had said she was going to send me the day before, with the message attached ""please help me"" so I message her once more, to which she sent me another message via a payment that told me not to use said messaging app to message her.

I found this highly odd but at least I knew that she was relatively ok and the person on the other end of the phone was talking in future tense. I just don't understand how they could have gotten my phone number from either of us unless it was given to them, since I did send my phone number to her on said messaging app but that message was  thousands of messages up in the chat, and I doubt someone who compromised her account would take the effort to read literally thousands of messages just to get to that.

Now you may be wondering why I didn't involve the authorities at this point, and I don't want to really get into that, it's a story for another time. So she gets around to calling me on a supposed burner phone to tell me that somehow some of her accounts have been compromised and that people are trying to find her with ill-intent. Now I didn't react with great reverence at first because honestly I found this whole situation so bafflingly farfetched given her propensity to lie, in fact I just sat there stunned.

To summarise a lot of needless detail afterward, she then stayed in hotels for some days, and then went to another city across the country to stay with some family.

My main point is that at numerous points in our relationship has claimed wild things, and has never sent any proof to back it up. These are just lies I could catch her out in and the current situation, but there are many many more instances of her story just not adding up, it's becoming harder and harder for me to live in a relationship like this every day where I doubt everything that she says. I honestly want to believe her, I do, but all of the constant supposed drama that she tells me about is just so confusing and constant and hard to believe. There are more incidents that I don't have the energy to type out in this post with the craziest stuff happening to her such as her somehow getting in a guys car who she knew was a creep and not in the right state of mind, and another where an apparently overly obsessed ex tried to break into her dorm room, which similarly don't add up. In reality barely anything that she tells me anymore adds up, which is what gives me the impression that she is just weaving an elaborate web of lies and it's becoming hard to maintain, but what I want to know is just why she even felt the need to lie about any of this in the first place. She knows I'm a reasonable person and that I prefer to work through problems than letting go of the relationship.

One last detail that I should add is that when she was studying abroad, we both had life360, so we could see where each other were at any one time, but a while before she supposedly moved back we both got rid of it.

Could she still be living in the other country and lying to me? And what about the phone call? Any comment or advice on all of this would be appreciated. I know that I have probably missed out some detail on here knowing myself, so make sure to read other comments first as I have likely responded with more about what's gone on. Thank you for taking the time to read and thank you for your consideration.

One of the biggest ones has been my past problems with drugs and addiction. I have been clean for over a year and have not done any drugs in the time I have known him except I used to smoke weed. He wanted me to quit cigarettes and weed and I have. 
  I care about him a lot. I wouldn’t throw what we have away for drugs like I had done for past relationships. The problem is that whenever I hang out with one of my best friends that is also clean that had struggled with addiction he always accuses me of using when I get home. He says that when I chew on my lips due to my anxiety it’s because I’m doing drugs again. I try to tell him I don’t. I try to stop chewing but it’s very difficult because I do it without thinking. Every day I come home he smells my breath and accuses me of being on drugs no matter what I do saying that because I am around her I will do drugs again. He doesn’t understand that I find comfort in being able to hang out with someone I can talk to about my past that understands and helps me continue my sobriety. He accuses me of being on meth and heroin and when I beg him to let me take a drug test to prove it to him he blows me off. I don’t know how to fix this or what I can do to prove it to him without having to cut off my best friend who is also one of my biggest supports.

2022-08-17 03:57:44,0,True,2,"Hello Reddit, I (22m) have had one heck of a year. To sum it up, From last summer to now I’ve done a complete 180 in terms of relationships and barriers. 

My ex-partner and I were still close at the time. We had a lot of mutual friends and tried to remain friendly even though we had broken up the year prior. (I set my boundaries and they got completely abused (SA) but that’s beside the point here). She eventually put up her own walls and treated me like a stranger. Eventually I acted out of pure emotion, because it wasn’t the ending I had pictured. I wanted to be the one who walked away first, I wanted to be the one who got the last laugh. And after all of this time I realize I had plenty of opportunities to do that and I didn’t do it. So once she had the opportunity, she left me behind and moved on to a better life. I envied it, it hurt, and it messed with me mentally for a year. (Still recovering and sorting through all of it).

However, the way I was treated and talked down upon will never leave my mind. I sacrificed so much for this person, and in the end they never cared about me and will never look back. 

I’m one of those people that will sacrifice and do anything for others, because I know the darkest places this world/reality has to offer. I never expect anything in return. 

You were so mean to me in the end and for what? I made one mistake and you treated me like a stranger. I would never wish the things you did to me on anyone else. 

Now I have a great core friend group, a partner that has my back and understands my previous trauma. I’m now seeing the light in other people again.

Due to the wifi in our house being really shitty upstairs where all the bedrooms are, my family and I are forced to share one room for all the computer and work stations. We each have our own, but they're all in one open room.

So the other day I was sexting with my partner (in my bedroom privately, obviously.) And we both sent each other some very suggestive (almost full nude) pics. Everything goes great and we wrap up. After cleaning up and resting for a bit, I go downstairs to the computer room, only to find out I left my monitor on, with the top window the very chat we used. By now all the pictures have been flooded up with other text, but the damage has been done, and I was sure at least one person has seen it.

About three weeks to by and no mention of it, so I thought I somehow managed to get off (haha) without being caught. Except today my mother and I were talking about an unrelated topic and she casually mentioned that she knows that we ""occusionally send each other weird pictures"" that we wouldn't want to be seen elsewhere. I instantly freak out and realize she must have seen. Luckily they weren't full nudes, but I feel like some serious damage has been done.

I keep being forcibly replayed this moment in my head every little bit as well as the initial realization like our brains love to do, and I just needed to get this out haha. Would be funny if you guys shared similar stories to get them off your chest's.

2022-09-11 05:16:53,9,True,37,"I don't really have anyone aside my partner to celebrate this with but I am so, so proud of myself that I'm going to overshare on the internet. 

In January of 2022 I found out I had vaginismus. I had never had sex before my current partner, we had been dating a few months at this point and the day we tried to go for penetration, it was like he hit a wall. I couldn't fit more than a finger inside without excruciating pain. Seriously, it felt like I was being ripped in two by my vag. We only tried one more time before concluding that it just wasn't going to work and that I likely had this condition. Now, I don't think having a condition like that makes a persons vag ""broken"" per se but I did feel that my bodily autonomy was completely out of my control.  

At this point I was recovering from a persistent medical procedure from a year back still and with this added on I felt like my body was against me and nothing was ""working the way it should"". My self esteem took a hit and intimacy with my partner was difficult because I felt underserving. I originally thought that I had a healthy outlook on sex but those first few months proved otherwise, as I had tied a lot of my self worth to my vagina and didn't think about my worth within an intimate setting.

If I had any other partner, though, I genuinely don't think I could've felt confident in my body or myself as he had stuck by me and supported me the entire way through. He never pressured me into anything and he always took care of my needs. Just a completely sweet guy :) Because of him I was able to actually enjoy sex and reframed my previous thinking of Sex = penetration. Or that I shouldn't expect to have fun ever. 

I suspect that the reason I had this condition was due to shame. Growing up in a religious household with little sex education or exploration of one's own body made my relationship with my vagina strained. So, over the summer, I bought some vaginal dilators (p much medical dildos that come in varying sizes) and went to work. 

It took a good 26 non consecutive days to work my way up to the final dilator. I went through all types of discomfort, stress, pain, and frustration. But, honestly if I hadn't built such a great relationship with my partner, I don't think I would've been able to dilate with a positive attitude. I was so inspired to learn about my body, as well as find a new avenue to connect with my partner that I persevered. 

Anyways, since we were long distance until a couple days ago, I hadn't been able to try the real thing. The first day we were together, yesterday, we decided to try again for the first time in 8 months. Unlike that first time where we were anxious and awkward, the experience felt natural and fun! We were able to successfully achieve penetration!!! Idk this isn't something I've told really anyone about but still wanted to celebrate my hard work. :)

2022-09-11 05:23:38,3,True,7,"TW: SEXUAL ASSAULT

I am a 25f. 

When I was 9 years old I was sexually assaulted by a family member. I ended up repressing the trauma and memories of what happened to me for years, until one night in 2017 it all came flooding back. 

Ever since I remembered what happened to me, I have had an unhealthy relationship with weed and alcohol. Not to the point of being addicted, but it was the only thing that seemed to help when the trauma became too much to handle. I haven’t found any healthy coping methods to help yet, and it’s been 5 years.

I told my mum, dad, brother and sister in law only last year. They have been very supportive but they don’t know how to help, which is fine I don’t expect it. I just don’t know what else to do at this point. I’m on the waiting list for therapy right now, and I’ve already been waiting for a year. It’ll be 2 years in January. My country is very bad with the mental health system, and it makes me feel so mad that I can’t get the help that I need.

Every couple of nights the trauma comes back and I remember it all; it causes me to shake uncontrollably and cry (there is more but it’s very hard to describe). It’s gotten so much worse for me recently and I can’t figure out why. I don’t know how much longer I can deal with it. It’s not fair that I’m going to have to deal with it for the rest of my life. I didn’t do anything to deserve all this pain. 
I’m not suicidal, just angry and exhausted.

2022-09-22 00:08:44,1,True,3,"TLDR: My girlfriend has a VERY strict approach to sex and my body now doesn't work like it used to. It has stopped me from getting wet at all, and feeling like this is making me dread sex everyday. Help.

So I need some advice. I (24f) am in a 3.5yr relationship w/ my gf (25f). To give some context, I've always had a pretty mid-to-high sex drive but also (like many women) in a responsive way, so I've always kind of fit whatever pace my partner has, for less or for more. My current girlfriend has a pretty low sex drive (due to antidepressants currently, but according to her it's always kinda been like that).

Since the beginning of our relationship I have had the impression that we weren't super compatible sexually. We had great sex, truly amazing sex at times, but just generally had different styles. I'm a very laid back person and she's not.

Over the course of our sex life, in multiple instances, we would have arguments during or right after sex because of something I had done - giggled (she'd feel self conscious), suggested changing positions when she was enjoying the one we were in, suggested a sex toy when she preferred to stay as we were, got tired so I couldn't keep the same pace, etc. You would think this would all be solved with communication, but here's the thing:

if I suggest X, she will say yes because she thinks that *if I suggested something in the first place, then I want it, and if she says no, then she'll disappoint me*. Mind you, this has never ever happened nor have I indicated feeling this way - this has, however, been her experience in the past with bad partners. She then says yes and fakes it until I realize she's frustrated and annoyed. We have talked about this and she understand it, but can't help it when it happens. Her frustration tolerance is also inredibly low, meaning if anything doesn't go perfectly according to her plan, that'll ruin her mood completely and she'll be visibly upset, meaning we either stop there or (most often) she'll fake being ok and trip both of us into finishing, otherwise she'll feel much worse (at which point I'm already not enjoying it and make myself go through with it just to avoid hurting her feelings).

This lack of flexibility has rasied my anxiety levels to the roof. As time went by I started dreading sex instead of craving it - and being relieved when we went to bed without it. She'll then say we're not having enough sex and we'll fuck out of guilt - which is plain awful.

Now, I have found I can't get wet anymore - which believe me, did NOT use to be a problem for me. I have confided in two of my friends who are also my exes (lesbians, I know) which I felt guilty enough about, and they were both SHOCKED, considering how aroused I would get over the slightest breeze. Now I can't even get wet by myself. Not thinking of something else, nothing.

I really truly love her. She has refused to go to therapy over her past trauma because she's already been in therapy for 5 years over other stuff and she's tired of it, and at this point I dont really know what to do. I really don't want to end it, but every time she ""jokes"" about me taking so long to get engaged with her I get extremely anxious as I know this is a serious issue for me and no amount of talkng through it will solve it without proper care.

There's also more around this like virtually everything I like in bed she's not into, but this post is already too long.

Does anyone have ANY advice besides breaking it off? If you think this is really the only solution, could you help me see the light? Is there something I might be doing thats causing all of this and I dont see it?",relationship_advice,Cannot get wet anymore because of my girlfriend - help,2.0,2022-09-22
2022-09-22 00:38:00,8,True,1,"My friend of over a year lied to me for months straight.

She also lied to me about a guy I was talking to and said he was running from the police so I should stay away from him because he is dangerous, when I confronted the guy the real story was that he had some mild legal issues with a landlord. She also told me to stay away from a different guy bc he has a gf, which IN TURN I ALSO FOUND OUT SHE LIED ABOUT THAT.

Not just that but she told me insanely private and explicit details about her best friend, for example how this girl likes getting pimped out by her boyfriend? She also gets angry when I'm with my other friend to the point where she will mimic my ig stories? If she's upset with me she will send me black snap streaks like a middle schooler and I don't even know what I did in the first place because we are grown adults.

Everytime she breaks up with her bf she comes running to me and tells me how evil he is and then the next day they're back together and I'm expected to be nice to him after she told me how evil he was? Not just that but she emotionally cheats on him with other men.

I've just been ignoring her for weeks after finding out about everything she's lied to me about, I can't trust her after not only lying to my face but telling me really personal details about her friends lives, I'm scared to know what she's told people about my life? I'm not sure if i should have confronted her or just stayed silent but I took a different friends advice and decided to move on silently and because of this she's been lashing out on social media?

Should I not engage? Or should I at least say something because I do feel guilty for just leaving her hanging although at this point I don't really think it's my responsibility.

2022-10-09 01:43:54,11,True,0,"My boyfriend (26) and I (25) have been together for seven years. We have made it through some difficult stages in life including me losing multiple family members, and us being long-distance for two years while he was abroad. Through this, we have only come out closer and stronger and have learnt to communicate and trust each other. He is the kindest person I know and I love him and want to have a family with him someday. 

Our general sex life is good and we are both open-minded, however, we both have different kinks which we struggle to incorporate into the bedroom. I'm into BDSM (both emotional and physical submission). We have tried roleplay/bdsm to an extent, but I can tell he is not inherently into it. On the other hand he has a fetish for a certain body type, which I don't have, and I find it uncomfortable when he only pays attention to certain parts of my body during sex. We have discussed both of our kinks in depth and we compromise by including certain aspects of our kinks into our sex life. However, there are parts of our kinks we are not comfortable doing with eachother and would also not feel comfortable doing with others in each other's presence (threesomes etc.) 

Sexually, I have only had a few sexual partners whereas he experimented significantly more before our relationship. Our relationship is monogamous with one exception - While we were doing long-distance a few years ago, the thought of him potentially wanting to sleep with somebody else while on a gap year was getting me really worked up. I unilaterally decided to give him a pass for a defined week to sleep with anyone he wanted, to get it out of his system if he did and I wouldn't ask him whether he had or hadn't.  Surprisingly, doing this gave me a sense of relief, and following the week I wasn't worried anymore and truthfully didn't want to know or care whether he had or hadn't during that week. He has years down the line shared with me that he didn't use the pass. 

We recently had a discussion about marriage and settling down. I opened up to him about being anxious that I have not explored much in my 20s and despite loving him so much, there is an irrational fear in the back of my mind that settling down and getting married will close off all other potential opportunities I could have had for emotional and physical intimacy with other people - that I will only be with him for the rest of my life. He admitted that he is also theoretically somewhat anxious about this, but that those are small losses compared to what we gain from our relationship. 

My bf will be travelling again for two months, and I am considering suggesting another pass, this time for us both for a defined period e.g. a few weeks while he is away. I feel this would allow him some freedom while he is abroad, whereas I would like to explore my kinks with someone from the BDSM community. I do already have somebody in mind (not a friend but a connection) who I know is part of the BDSM community and who I know is trustworthy (as I am worried about meeting an unknown stranger from online). Of course, my bf and I would need to work out strict rules and honestly discuss all angles in order to agree any kind of pass/opening up of our relationship for this period. 

I don't feel comfortable sharing any of this with friends and therefore wanted a second view on whether I should broach such an option with my bf, (including the option of my pass involving someone I know of) or whether others have had similar experiences.

For some context, I tried to kill myself via overdose but instead I told someone and I was sent to a mental hospital for 7 days. The night before I went back to school I was on ft with her and she started calling me a pussy for trying to commit suicide.

I took it as a joke and didn’t say anything to her but recently we got into a fight for no reason. I started saying that I was lazy and in school work and that I was depressed and which is true, but then for some reason she started taking it personal. She started saying that it wasn’t an “excuse” because she also has mental health issues and that she also had to see a therapist.

I’m not really proud of how I worded the next sentence I said but I told her “stop comparing your bullshit to my bullshit” as in a way to tell her that she shouldn’t be comparing our state in mental health just because she was mad abt the way I felt. She started screaming saying stuff like “oh so my mental health is bs to you huh??!” And I told her I didn’t mean it like that

And that I just meant it in a way of telling her we are not we same, and I told her she called my problems bs before anything else. She said that she only said that me trying to kill my self was bs and I told her that was really fucked up to say because suicide is a serious matter nowadays.

I just feel so annoyed at how she gets to insult me and see it as a joke but as soon as I say something insulting back to her she doesn’t speak to me and goes off on me.

How do I start this? This is very hard since is my first time opening up about this to strangers in the internet, but my family has never been for me and I really need to get this out of my chest.

I cant remember anything when I was r*ped, is like my brain is trying to shut down those memories. I can remember how my family found out tho. Even after my family found out, he continued to molest me. Because of it, I became really insecure about myself, not only physically, but I don’t know how to stand up for myself or others, I can’t communicate well with others, and I’m kind of an asocial person because of him. He continued with his life, he did groomed other girls, my family never said anything to him, they just kind of forgot about it. My mom acts like nothing happened. I’m pretty sure my dad doesn’t know. We are from Mexico so is kind of normalized for grown ass men to date 15-19 girls. I will not say the age of his wife but she is younger than me. I developed anxiety attacks after all this. He did some pretty fucked up things. He stole from my grandma, my mom, my dad, my aunts, and cousins. He lied about being kidnapped, he lied about being in school. He just did it to steal money  from my dad. He bought a car that was way out of the budget my dad gave to him. He’s being kind of struggling with money so my parents are kind of helping him, he had to sell his car. Even tho where he is living used to be my dads house (he gifted to him bc he was having the baby with my SIL). He never had to worry about anything. I had to grow up very young because of his fucking behavior. I started to work at 14.  Have making my own money ever since. I’ve had good grades. Yet am not someone to be proud of.

I’ve been knowing that I’m pregnant for a little over 3 weeks. My boyfriend was the first person i told. He just seemed so excited and we have been talking about the baby. Not much but we have been talking about a baby shower and saving etc. 

Yesterday my boyfriend asked to borrow $20 which isn’t much but i have him a hard conversation about the importance of saving at a time like this. The conversation led to an argument to where he said “you’re doing better than me financially, you have all this money etc”

I asked him did he want the baby : And he admitted he just wasn’t ready for a baby right now and then he followed by you’re not ready either 

I immediately burst into tears. Because i really want to keep my baby. I couldn’t see me killing it even though I’m only 7 weeks. This might be my only opportunity to have a child so i really want to raise it. 

He argued with me for an hour over the phone and told me we both weren’t ready especially him. He told how i had all these great things going on and how a baby would set me back and that he didn’t have real income and that i should understand 

I told him I’d raise the baby alone or is just be a single mom and I’d figure something out
I told him i wouldn’t force him to be a father
I told him i would do it alone and he doesn’t care he just wants the baby gone

2022-12-01 09:21:56,1,True,0,"I tagged this as NSFW because I know it can be a sensitive topic. 

I've always struggled with my weight, I always felt fat and not skinny enough. I came from a pretty abusive household where things like ""fat"" and ""bitch"" were thrown around regularly. Not directed at me, but at my mom. I think I've grown to internalize all of that. 

Two years ago I was skinny, almost too skinny. My Snapchat memories show pictures of me where you can clearly see my ribs. I know what started this. My grandpa died two years ago and my grandma didn't have enough money to support herself. My mom and I moved into her house to help pay bills. My grandma is from my dad's side of the family, and we had moved out to get away from him. Sadly he's sort of a stalker and he continues to harm us even now, with the excuse that he wants to visit his mom (even though he's told us many times that he abosultely hates her and wishes she would just die so he could get her money). 

The thing is, all those years ago when we first moved in I was at a healthy weight, but my grandma would make comments about how I was overweight or obese, and that she was never my size when she was my age. I was about 125 pounds while being 5'6"". I remember not believing her at first, but it eventually got to me. I stopped eating, I only drank one Keurig hot cocoa every day at fifty calories. It worked! I dropped the weight at an alarming rate. It was so alarming in fact that my mom and grandma began to worry about me, forcing me to eat until I couldn't anymore. Which was only a few bites honestly. Even when I wanted to recover I felt stuck because I couldn't eat as much as they wanted me to, It's been a long battle these two years to push these thoughts aside and focus on what's good for me. 

I was diagnosed with schizophrenia and put on different pills for it. They worked somewhat, but I gained lots of weight from them. It could've also been the anxiety or depression meds. Whatever it was I gained weight fast. I hadn't noticed it until it was pointed out to me again. I recently stopped taking the pills, scared that I'd become too fat. I've lost a few pounds while off the meds, but not as much as I gained on them. I now weigh close to 200 (around 176, but i always round up) pounds, still at 5'6"". I feel worthless and ugly. Looking at all the recent family photos makes me want to vomit, and I actually have thrown up after seeing how bad I look in some of the photos. I don't know what to do, but slowly the urge to just stop eating has come back to me. It doesn't help that I already know what to say or do to make my family believe that I've eaten that day.

I'm really scared because when I first had the eating disorder I didn't know the side effects. I'm a hypochondriac, and now that I've done research into it I'm worried that I'll start making myself believe that I'm having heart issues if I start losing weight. I also tried to commit suicide recently using trazodone. The doctors told me it could've seriously messed with my heart, so I'm scared to do anything risking that. Still, it scares me because these urges to just stop eating altogether become stronger every day. I've also noticed myself denying meals and forcing myself not to eat lunch, or only eating half of dinner. 

I don't want anyone close to me to know, and I don't feel like I need advice. I just feel that if I told anyone close to me they'd try and stop me. They were there when it happened before, and I saw the worry on their face. It scared me and made me feel guilty, but it also made me feel like everyone else saw the improvement as well. I just felt like I needed to tell this to someone, even if it was just strangers on the internet who don't care. I'm scared to relapse, but I also feel the urge to do it anyway. I just needed to get this off my chest before it festered and became some other thing I'd have to deal with. If you're reading this, thank you for listening to me I guess.

My SO and I have been together for several years. I haven't had many concerns throughout our relationship but lately, things have felt a bit off.

My worries come in because our sex life has been spotty for a while. He often says it's due to work stress that kills his libido, but his porn history tells me a different story.

At that time I was dating a girl, and it was fresh and we were really into each other and we had a great semester together. But as the semester drew to a close, we dreaded the end where we would have to leave and go to our home countries. At this point I (M26) and her (F25) wanted to try and do things that we would not get to do with each other again. 

So one day we set out to buy some psilocybin mushrooms as I was very fond of them and she wanted to try them for the first time with me alone. So long story short (another adventure for another time) we acquired these mushrooms and got home to give ourselves the trip of a lifetime. 

To give context, at this point I was living with a German roommate who both me and my GF at the time were very good friends with. He knew we were taking these mushrooms. After we had consumed and before our trip, he mentioned to us that he was going out. Right after him mentioning that, we had our trip kick in. Now mind you, we both took a very good amount, almost double what is normally taken because we wanted to see vivid images. 

After some time had passed, we decided to move to the living room and just relax there. It honestly felt like an eternity and we assumed my roommate had left already and that we were all alone. Now you can imagine what happens when two people, about to leave each other and on drugs assume they have the whole place to themselves. We started making out and one thing led to another, with blankets over us, and me under the blanket all the way down when all of a sudden my roommate walks into the living room. At this point we look up and both are stunned and naked, out of our minds. My GF burst into a fit of laughter that continued and did not stop for a good half an hour. Every time she looked up she would start laughing uncontrollably.

Me being a veteran and used to the experience was in much more control and assured him that we had no clue he was still there and we were sorry, and that he can use the couch again its not ruined. He laughed with us and to this day kept the story to himself as we made him promise. To this day we think back and fall into laughing fits on how 10mins in reality seemed like 2 hours to us.

Let me start this off by saying I love my boyfriend beyond words, I truly want to spend the rest of my life with him. Let me also say I’ve communicated these things to him and I just don’t know what to do anymore.

We’ve been officially together for around a year, we moved in together really quick. In all other aspects we are beyond happy and we communicate about everything constantly. 

Sex is something we talked about in the very beginning of our relationship. He specifically said the phrase “if we wouldn’t have been sexually compatible I wouldn’t be with you” things are different now, as he’s stated but that phrase keeps ringing in my ears. 

I have a very high libido, I could literally go all day. I’m beyond generous in bed, I love giving head and not to sound cocky I’m really fucking good at it. When we first started dating it was at least a few times a week+ and I was fine with that. I love every position and switching it up, to be honest I don’t know if it’s purely laziness but 90% of the time he wants me on top. Which is not my favorite but I’ll do it regardless because I genuinely love sex. (The intimacy + it makes me feel sexy)

I’ve always been the one to initiate things for the most part. With kissing, touching, etc. his idea of initiating things is “let’s go have a quickie”. Which is fine I deal with it but it comes across as lazy. To get into some heavy backstory, he’s had an issue with drinking (could be a completely separate post) and couldn’t get it up. We’ve been dealing with all of that and he’s calmed it down on the drinking and it’s less of an issue other than he never wants to have sex.

I stopped I initiating things purely because I realized how gross it made me feel. Like I’m pressuring him into doing it. &amp; after you’ve been rejected enough times i decided to leave it up to him. Let’s put it this way, in the last 2 months we’ve had sex maybe 4 times. All of which were “quickies” with me on top. I’m going absolutely mad I don’t know what to do.

I’ve talked to him about it, he knows about my sex drive. I’ve literally told him “I’m always in the mood”. I feel like I’ve already sacrificed so much when it comes to my sex life I’m just frustrated now. 

It’s turned into him making excuses now, “we literally had sex 3 days ago” (when it had actually been over a week), “no you can’t give me head right now because we have to do this” “I want you to sleep for work in the morning” (I work nights). “I’m really tired”

If he genuinely is not feeling it I’m not going to push it, I respect consent and boundaries but FUCK. I feel like I’ve tried everything. Lingerie, I compliment him constantly and hype him up, I’ve talked to the ends of the earth about my needs and what I can do to help him.

I’ve gone over every cause

- I don’t think it’s porn addiction but there’s no way he’s going 2 weeks without getting off.

- I take care of myself, hair wise, hygiene wise and see my doctor regularly for care down there so I know there’s not an issue.

- I offer purely to give and my advances are shut down

- we check in with each others mental health and are extremely honest with the things going on in our lives, we’re both in a really good place. 

- he says he has a high sex drive and I’m just like “THEN WHERE IS THAT ENERGY GOING”

- he’s not cheating and I know that for a fact. 

I’m worries he’s not attracted to me anymore, I’m a very confident person and this is the first time I’ve second guessed myself in a long time. I’m going to bring it up again tonight but in my opinion it’s like flowers, I don’t want you to get me flowers just because I told you to. I want you to do it because you want to.

I got every answer like I didn’t buy it, I didn’t get it, I don’t have a meth problem and all I asked from her was what was the bag and how did it get there. She claimed she saw it in a box recently while we were moving and she put it in there and thought nothing of it and thought it was from a time perhaps we did drugs together.

For now I have stopped pressing as the response I’m getting is just flat out she has no knowledge of it or how it got there. 

Any help or advice on how to handle this would be appreciated I’m never one for reaching out but I just feel lost.",relationship_advice,A little advice.,4.5,2022-03-04
2022-03-04 07:13:55,5,True,11,"My girlfriend and I have been together for roughly 10 years. We have been on and off a few times, as most relationships that started in high school are. Over the years I’ve watched her blossom and bloom into one of the most intelligent and beautiful people I’ve ever met in my life, and I love her immensely. However, through the years I’ve witnessed her experience horrible things that I won’t go into. But nonetheless they were extremely traumatic and caused a lot of psychological damage.
As of late, we’ve both been struggling hard with different aspects of our careers and working two jobs apiece to support ourselves and the pursuit of our respective careers.
Out of this, we are both exhausted and mentally drained on a regular basis. With the exhaustion, comes drinking and trying to enjoy what little free time we have.
For the last few months, she tells me every once in awhile she will vent to me (and I will gladly listen, because I want to help her with any and all issues because we are in this together and I love her), and in the midst of the conversation she will drop that is suicidal and thinks about dying almost every day.
No matter what I say, I feel as though I can’t help her sometimes. I want to be there, and I am as much as I can.
But I feel so lost.
These types of conversations are coming more frequently and it scares the absolute shit out of me.
I can’t lose her.

Is there anything more that I could do/ has anyone dealt with a similar experience?

2022-03-23 03:06:56,3,True,12,"This happened about 2 hours ago--because that's how long it took to clean everything up and shower until the crippling paranoia of invisible feces particles washed away a little. If you haven't caught on already, beware, I am going to be talking about poop--lots of it.

So there's a little something called the gastrocolic reflex. Ever ate something and suddenly had an overwhelming urge to poop? That's the reflex kicking in to leave space for whatever junk you just ate. This happens to me quite frequently, and it usually ends with a pleasant dump before continuing with my life (I wash my behind, do not fret). However, today's poop urges were rather demanding; laying on the bed absolutely devouring some Ritz crackers, I quickly realized this wasn't a, ""hey, you can always go later"" type of crap, oh no, this was a ""RUN. NOW."" So I race to the bathroom as fast as I can.

Of course, I didn't forget about splashback. Nothing could make me forget about splashback. A fun fact about America is that some of our toilets have a ridiculous amount of water that will happily dive into your crack after each poop that cannonballs into your toilet. I honestly don't understand how barely anyone here puts toilet paper in their toilet before using it (or maybe it's because I am taking abnormally large dumps?). I don't know whether I should inform them and ruin their life or allow them to enjoy the bliss of ignorance I wish I had. Anyway, so this big dump I concluded I was about to take meant I needed a lot of toilet paper to block out the splashback. I rip a huge amount of toilet paper and lay it in the toilet. I knew it was a lot more than I usually put, but--hey--there is probably going to be a poop meteor shower in a few seconds, so what could go wrong?

This wasn't solid poop, no, it was diarrhea. After I finish doing the things you should be doing after pooping, I close the lid and flush. Now, listen! Or don't, because I'm about to tell you a fact about toilets that will either change your life for the better, or ruin how you view anything in your bathroom (like your toothbrush). So there's another little something--or rather millions of, tiny, invisible, disgusting little somethings--that spray several feet into the air after every flush. This is sprayback and the reason why virtually every single thing in your bathroom is covered in feces particles.  I am horrified of it, so I flush with the lid closed every time (and I hope you do too). I usually have to flush 3-4 times with pauses in between the gurgles to prevent overflowing because our toilet sucks, but this time I heard a much more intense gurgle gurgle than usual. No way was I opening that lid, and this is where I screw up: I keep flushing. I know, I know! I shouldn't have, but there was no way I was going to look at a whirlpool of toilet paper, liquid shit, and water. At that point I should have grabbed the plunger, but instead I convinced myself that if I paused long enough, the water would turn back to its ""normal"" level.

Shit water. Shit water everywhere, spilling from every side of the toilet bowl. ""Noo!"" I yelled. I mean, what else could I do, scoop it all with my hands? The only thing I could do was watch the feces water fill the floor. Fortunately, it quickly stopped (thank god), but the time it takes for the mess to spread was quicker; the damage was done, and now I had to clean it up. After the toilet was thoroughly...pumped...I took about an hour drying the floor. I was greeted by a spot of doodoo on the toilet rim as I lifted it up, and I never wanted to die more than that very second I wiped it off. As if things weren't worse already, there was barely any laundry detergent left, so I had to wash the carpets with what I believe was too little soap to efficiently clean the...soiled bathroom rugs.

Despite my efforts to clean this mess, I know nothing is really clean. The floor is still covered by feces and toilet water particles, slowly seeping under the cracks of the sink that can never be touched unless it is completely demolished. We currently do not have sanitization products. Unless this bathroom goes through a deep sanitization cleansing, it will never be as clean as I want it to be. I threw away the sandles I wore while cleaning and took the worst shower of my life. I don't think I will ever be happy again.

2022-04-04 19:19:38,154,True,3056,"This happened a couple weeks ago but my gf (22F) just gave me (21M) the idea to post it here. English is not my first language so please forgive me for the mistakes in the text.

My parents decided to go out the city for a few days to visit my family, they asked me if I wanted to go but I don't really like that town, so I chose to stay in my home. After they left I called my gf and asked her if she wanted to come to my place and spend those days with me, she said yes and I went to pick her up.

We had a great time, arguably the best weekend of my life, we went out with some friends and decided to go on a roadtrip on the last day we had alone. Fast forward to that day, I told my gf we should leave early to make the most of the day but things didn't go as planned because we woke up specially horny that morning. Big mistake.

Of course when we were done it was already late, we still had to shower and dress up, so I placed the used condom on a table that's in my bedroom to throw it later in a black plastic bag where I was dumping all the sex residues as I didn't want my parents to notice what happened in their abscence. Quick parentheses here; I have a dog, he's a foodie, eats literally any food he finds, sometimes he also grabs towels or plastic bags and likes to destroy them and leave his mess all over my house, but he never had taken anything from my bedroom besides my shoes. Back again with the story, I left my bedroom door open while we took a shower, a few moments later I found myself standing in front of my table, no signs of the condom, only the wrapper. My first thought was ""I'm freaking dumb, there's no way I can't remember where the condom is"", but after my gf was done taking a shower I asked her if she knew where it was but she said no. I took the wrapper and went downstairs to throw it into the black plastic bag, praying that my stupid ass had already dumped the condom into that bag but somehow managed to forget it in a few minutes. As expected, that was not the case.

I went back upstairs panicking and told my gf that I couldn't find the condom. My parents were coming back home in a few hours but those were hours we didn't have cause we already had this roadtrip planned that would take us the entire day. I told her that maybe my dog took the condom and hid it somewhere underneath the couch, so we started looking for it but it was nowhere to be seen. After half an hour we gave up and left the house, worried that my parents would come home and find the condom before us. I told her joking ""the best thing that could happen right now is that my dog swallowed the condom and in a few days I'll be picking up his poop to find it there"". Of course this wasn't the best scenario either because in the morning I go to the university and my mother usually picks his poop while I'm away, so it was a 50/50 chance.

We came back later in the night that day, I said hello to my parents, everything's normal. Next day in the morning I wake up really early to check my dog's poop, but there wasn't any poop and I had to leave to university. Next day I do the same thing, but this time there was poop. I took a plastic bag and scooped the poop. My worst nightmare had become true, there it was. I had a series of mixed feelings, from grossness to relief, so I texted my gf and told her ""WE ARE SAFE!!!!"" with a picture of my dogs finest piece of art attached. Since that day he gained a new title: the balloon-eater. Lesson learned.

2022-04-04 19:20:22,4,True,2,"I (21m) am with my partner (20f) and we had a kid together. Our kids about 8 months old and we've done a lot of work in our relationship as parents who had kids fairly young and there's a lot of love in our relationship. We do things that show we care about eachother, go on dates, and regularly go to both our own and a couples therapist to help us work through issues as they arrive. It feels really healthy and I love them a lot but I've just noticed that while they clearly are like in a place again where they can be sexual and want to be, like they'll send me porn on Twitter even, whenever I try to do a romantic gesture not even in a sexual sense more often then not I get shut down. I'll set up romantic dates with like wine, crackers, our favorite music, and bigger ones too like driving out off town to sit under the stars and have a nice dinner, they'll have fun but if I try to move it past like cuddling and even try to just make out a bit they don't want to.

   There's been several times I ask them if they wanna take a shower with me and they'll say yes! But then change their mind. In the past like 4 months I can recall setting up at around 10 romantic slightly more sexual scenarios asside from dates or during and we've only done like 3 of them. And slept with eachother once at a complete random time where they went to bed early then I guess decided they wanted to mess around when they couldnt fall asleep. I've never counted numbers like that in a relationship before but it's starting to really bother me and when I bring it up their responses have been either like genuine apologetic or why do I care.

    Like just today we planned to have a romantic shower this morning and they decided they didn't want to. I was like ok but then when I came back in the room after the shower all they were doing was calling their friend and it just really fucking hurt...I've never felt this way before. They care deeply about me and have stood up for me like no one has before WE HAD A FREAKING KID TOGETGER! But when it comes to the romantic stuff it just doesn't feel like their interested when they claim to be hyper sexual and even at the beginning of our relationship entirely was hyper sexual (ngl part of how we ended up with our adorable son lol) I just don't know how to bring it up. In the past they said it will get better eventually so part of me is like just Continue being patient but at the same time they have been very hurtful like this morning with the shower.

Here's the backstory, it was me (8) my sister (3) and my mom. My dad went to prison for rape when I was five and my mom was physically and mentally abused by him for the 8 years she has known him. After 2 years of my mom being terrified, she started dating again manged to find me a dad. He is a great dad to me and my sister. I am a better person than the kid I was before and he has taught me so much on how to be a man and work ethic and such. Anyways he has 5 kids before he met me and my sister. Let's call them joe(6), billy(7), will(9), Rachelle (14) and asshole aka Steve(13). I got along swell with them and so did my sister, we laughed and played and did things that kids did. The only person who was always a dick for no damn reason was Steve, he always picked on me and my sister, always hit or stole my stuff just to annoy me. Time passes and I start to get big into video games, I played them before but now I was on them 24/7 and so did my brothers. My sister would beg for me to play with her like we used to but I would always tell her to play by herself and to go away and such. I was horrible to her, my brothers started to bully her more around that time and me being a dumb kid I joined in. I would end up taking her to Rachel's room so they would play and I could play Xbox all day. This went on for weeks. Up until one day Steve offers to play with my sister who was 4 at the time. I said yes and they went to his room. Idk how long it was but it was hours until dinner time and we all went down. This happened for days until steve gets into an argument about not wanting to work for my step dad's business cause he is a lazy bastard. My step dad says to go with his mother. Steve leaves and my step dad is crying in his room. The next day will and Rachael and will  leave because they are not my step dad's biological kids. Their mom told lies about my step dad stating how bad of a parent he was and how he beat them and forced them to do hard work. The only times he hit them was when they fucked up really really really bad. And we did yard work because it's our chores and it taught us a thing or too. Anyways she lied and months later my mom finds my sister crying and sobbing to herself. We find out that Steve has sexually abused my sister in his room while I played video games, it had been going on for months. My mom didn't press charges because she felt he was all young to ruin his life with prison or sm. His mom out of fear sent him to another city miles away for a year and she gave a half asses apology. 2 years later Steve decided to speak up and lie stating how it's my sister's fault, how he did nothing wrong and how we came from  a poor neighborhood so she deserved it and shit. My sister cried the entire night and I sat in my bed full of hate, I hated him for the things he did but most of all I hated myself for not being a better brother, for not being their for her and not being strong enough to protect her.

So, as she sometimes does, my (24m)  fiance (23f) has developed a bout of baby fever. Between her friends and my coworkers having kids, my dad having a kid (6 month old kid at 42 is a bit rough, but hes happy so I'm happy for him) and seeing all the photos of cute babies, she wants one of her own. We agreed that the *very earliest* it will happen after our wedding, but despite that, she wants a family, she wants to have something of her own due to her having a broken family. There's nothing wrong with that, and I'm happy that she wants a future with me, but that's kind of where I start to see the kink cropping up. NSFW and maybe TMI from here on out.

I think she has been slowly developing an impregnation kink and is subconsciously playing into it when it comes to our sex life. We use birth control and condoms, and do our best to be safe. But she goes on and on about how she just wants me so bad, and wants me to cum deep in her. She said she loves my big loads and told me that she wants me to cum deep in her when I dont use a condom so that it stays in her. I ensure that she takes her birth control when that happens to minimize risk, of course. There's more to it than that, but I've already gotten into the nasty details enough, so I'll stop it there. She hasn't made a connection between sex and the explicit talk of impregnation stuff, but its there from my perspective.

So, my question is should I play into her perceived desires and try to reinforce the kink and foster it so that she can develop it  or should I let her take the lead so that she can come to terms and develop it on her own?

2022-04-20 23:19:03,4,True,1,"I've been putting off writing this for a while now, because I want other peoples opinions, but I guess.. having to type it all out makes me relive it again so I've put it off, but I feel pretty terrible and I guess just want to see reddits opinion on the matter and hopefully if the opinion is that it wasn't my fault maybe it'll help me get over my self blame issue.

I'm going to try to keep this short because it's making me sick to type this out- but in a nutshell, I met my ex girlfriend about a year ago, we talked for a couple of weeks, she told me ""she didnt think me and her being together romantically was a good idea"" and that she still liked her ex that sexually assaulted her. We stopped talking until this January, right away she seemed very sexual and.. well she made things go really fast between us. I see that as a bad sign, but I always think, and hope that ""this is the one, so it doesn't matter how fast we go"". I go out with her and her parents to meet them, it was really awkward, I was expecting them to ask me questions or talk to me at least a little bit but it ended up with me having to start  basically all the conversation, but I thought it went well enough. She told me they liked me, and I believed her full heartedly. Keep in mind, her family/parents are VERY rich compared to me, the house they live in is a mansion compared to my small suburban home, she said from the get go that her dad had high standards, or not high standards but that I ""needed to dress nice"" Well that was a problem because where I live it is normal to dress casually, sweat pants and a tshirt, stuff like that, for the date I wore what I thought was the fanciest outfit I had, I tried my best to make a good impression and for a while I assumed they really did like me because again, I trusted my girlfriend, I was completely confident that she wouldn't lie about that. We kept on dating and we went to each other's houses a lot until March when she left me, she mostly came to my house and not vise versa though, but I didn't think anything of it. Me and her continue to go out with her mom (her dad was always busy with work or something) and I didn't really talk to her mom while on these trips, just my girlfriend. Now keep in mind, I'm not the best conversation starter, I forced myself on the first date but now that I was under the impression her parents liked me I didn't think anything of it, I'm not rude either, if she would have talked to me or asked me how my day was or anything like that I would have talked my heart out, but she never did. Her mom basically ignored my existence, which again, I didn't think anything of. I trusted my girlfriend and just assumed that maybe her parents were awkward and didn't know what to say to me or something like that (well to be honest for the most part I just completely didn't notice it at all, and just trusted my girlfriends word) but eventually, about a week before my girlfriend left, she got distant, and couldn't come over as much. I didn't think anything of it, I asked if everything was alright and everything and she said yes, I asked this a few times until I just convinced myself that everything was ok and that she wouldn't lie (I've had overthinking issues in the past, so It felt great believing that I could just trust her and not worry, but turns out I was wrong) So here we are on the day itself, March 3rd 2022, we meet up at school like we usually did and she told me that she ""Didnt feel the same way anymore"" and broke up with me. That was left with me basically shaking as I was walking to my class, having a panic attack. The day after, one of our mutual friends said that ""she never told me anything about it"", I trust this friend greatly, she wouldnt lie. The day after our mutual friend said that  she ended up telling me that in her words that my ex's parents are ""classist pieces of shit and said you weren't good enough"" and that I wasn't ""confident"" enough. This was then followed by my ex telling me herself on discord to confirm that this was in fact the case. I thought there was an opening for me to attempt to save the relationship by mentioning that I'm totally fine with dating behind her parents back if I had too, and that I wasn't going to let something like this tear our relationship apart. She denied all of that and said I ""just want to be friends"". She then texts me a few days later accusing me of doing something that I didn't do (asking her friends about her or something like that) and when I got upset at her she snapped at me saying I was trying to argue, I wasn't trying to argue, but the only person that had lied was HER and I was upset that she would accuse me of it after her lying possibly is the reason our relationship ended, because I could have forced myself to conversation with her parents if I just had known that there was an issue, I did it on the first meet with them, I could have done it more, I just didn't think I needed too, anything I would have had to do for us to work out I would have done, and I made that clear. It also doesn't  help that she nearly took my virginity (less than one month in the relationship in Febuary) It was consensual of course, but I had made clear to her how special doing sexual stuff with her was to me and that the fact that I'm willing to do it with her means that I basically want to marry her, so it just hurts even more that she lied through that, I feel used, I feel betrayed, and I know I shouldn't blame myself, but I do. Now here I am, alone, missing her, and less than two months after the break up she's already matching profile pictures with someone else (so shes most likely already talking to someone else, maybe even dating them) So I guess here's my question, was it my fault?

I walk up to what seems like a normal home and I wonder if maps has failed me, but decide to see anyway, and there's a sign on the door, saying to just enter, I enter into what seems like a waitingroom with a sign on the wall that say to take place and that someone will be with me shortly, before I get to put the clues together a woman is in the doorframe, she's only wearing lingerie and stockings.

This poor woman looks as confused as I feel and I manage to stutter out ""I-I think I'm at the wrong place"" This woman looks me up and down, there I was in a sweater and a school bag and a puzzled expression and then replies ""I think you're right sweetie"" I get kind og flustered and explain what I was looking for and she explained that the shop used to be nearby but moved further into the city, but she couldn't remember where it was, so I thanked her, apologised for wasting her time and left again.

I found what I was looking for about 20 minutes later after my boyfriend found the shop on google, so we get to get freaky tonight !

2022-05-04 07:42:20,12,True,10,"Been with my boyfriend for 2 years now and I have always been suspicious of him. It was one day a year ago where I randomly tested positive for chlamydia. I have NEVER had another relationship or partner and I was genuinely confused when I got the results. I thought maybe it was a false positive or worst case scenario from a dirty toilet seat or something along those lines, little did I know. I told my boyfriend about the results and he instantly blamed it on me. He told me he was gonna break up with me and that it wasn’t him but I obviously knew it wasn’t me. I was so in love I believe him and thought it was caused from something out of my control ( I didn’t know how these diseases worked at this time, i do now)  I kept a note of the dates I was negative and then positive to narrow down the dates when my boyfriend could’ve cheated on me. 
       After making up about  2 months later I found texts in my boyfriends phone about going to a hooker ( around same time frame I had narrowed down) . I’m infuriated and I show him and he insists it was a mistake and he didn’t end up going Bc he felt too guilty. I doubted him but he wouldn’t admit it and I nagged and nagged and got nothing. 
  Fast forward 8 months later I lied to my boyfriend about who I hung out with (nothing serious). After hours of reconciling we decided to get everything off our chests and sort of start with a clean slate. This is when he admitted to having sex with a prostitute. I put it behind me because the deal with starting a clean slate was that I can’t hold a grudge for anything admitted , but I think this one is an exception. I was heartbroken but didn’t know what to do Bc he had told me days before my birthday. I put it behind me but on the inside I was dying and I still am. It’s been almost a year and I cry myself to sleep every night about this, it’s pretty self explanatory why. Every time I try to talk to my boyfriend about it he just tells me I promised to not get mad if he told me, as if it’s some sort of blessing that he told me and I need to keep my end of the deal. At this point I’m disgusted and I’m beyond tired of hearing him be so un sympathetic especially to his own girlfriend, u would think their would be remorse or even some respect or human decency. It’s still a year later and he is  still acting like it was nothing and makes me feel like I’m wrong for my emotions. I was and am very much effected by this and it was even worse because I couldn’t even go talk to him about it and obviously couldn’t talk to any friends Bc I am too embarrassed for anyone to find out, even to this day. I feel like an idiot for staying but also feel like it’s so far gone. I am severely affected but I love my boyfriend so much he is my world and every time I think of this I just think of it crashing down.

TW: mentions of dog death, mentions of self inflicted death



There's one big issue: my dog. She's a 14 year old chocolate lab and I rescued her from an ex's mom. I cannot bring her to my parents with me. They have a dog and they're both dog reactive. My dog is an angel on heaven, she's the reason I get out of bed most days and she has never gone a day without food, water, and at least one walk around the neighborhood under my care. I've contacted rescues and they will not take her in because she's dog reactive/it's hard to home a elderly lab. I even got into a Twitter feud with a random lady who told me trying to find a home for my dog via the internet was ""wrong and illegal.""

When I called my mom this past Friday to tell her about my situation and how I'd probably be moving back, she was supportive to me. Problem A arises: they have no room for me (five full grown people in a 3BR/2.5B home).

Problem B is, as mentioned above, my dog. Without hesitation, the first conversation we discussed about the dog, she brought up getting her euthanized. Understandably, I get upset. She continues to play this ""oh its not that bad"" and ""I shared it on Facebook and gave you the contact of a rescue lady, so I'm trying to help"" card so she can diminish my anger about her suggesting I put my perfectly healthy dog to rest. I am beyond pissed, fucking seething. I had to call a vet and ask if they would even put down a healthy dog (they will not by the way), all while absolutely sobbing to the poor woman on the phone. Then my mother tells me I'm being ""extreme"" because I'm pissed at her that she wants me to put her down. THE NERVE of this woman to even tell me ""I told you not to get it in the first place.""

i. would. be. dead. without. this. dog. I would've offed myself long ago. even now, I think that killing myself would be a better fucking option than moving in with them, but even then she'd probably be like ""I told you not to get this dog, this is all the dogs fault, should've put it down"" 

This brings us to now. I'm laying in bed, crying, taking way too long to write a reddit post about my horrible mother and her horrible behavior. She does not ""mean well"" at all. At the end of the day, she just wants the dog to be gone so she doesn't have to worry about it.

These past 4 days I've had some issues. I wasn't able to go number 2 for 3 days and I was feeling nauseous,bloated and painful. I could barely eat something so I decided it was time. I sent my fiance (29m) to the drugstore to get me some laxatives. I have had no prior experience with them so I was kinda nervous. He opted for some pills that need to work in and I will never forgive him for it.


Now here comes the screw up. You are supposed to take them before you go to bed since they need to work in so I did. I was expecting them to be instant but they were a slow burner. Everything went fine and I went to bed. Then 6 am rolls around. I wake up in agony, my stomach was hurting so bad so I knew it was time. Now round number 1 was very underwhelming so I didn't think much of it and said to myself ""hmmm these are not that strong."" Oh how I would be wrong. After 8 trips to the toilet I was empty, I was ugly sobbing on the toilet with pain and wanted to go back to bed. Once everything was over I felt empty and good again. Until I woke up from my nap.


Now I still had stomach aches and after 8 rounds wasn't able to go number 2 again so once again tonight before bed I decided you know what? Screw it. I'll take them again and soldier through it. After all I take my number 2's very very seriously. It's now currently 4 am and I woke up at 3 am again with a giant stomach ache. As it turned out I was still not empty from the day before and the pills decided to speed up the process this time. I almost didn't make it to the toilet but when I say I lost 20 pounds I mean it.

2022-05-17 02:29:22,60,True,373,"Hello everyone! As the title suggests, I(24m) am in fact dying at the age of 24 of lung cancer. As lung cancer is fairly uncommon among under 25 year olds, especially ones with no history of tobacco use, all the signs unfortunately went under the radar until it was too late, my cancer has now progressed to Stage 4 and has spread to other parts of my body. I was given 6 months to one year to live.

I haven’t told anyone in my life. I have kept my diagnosis a secret for 2 months, and have tried to hide the effects of my treatments as much as possible. I don’t have much contact with my father (51m) and my mother died ironically the same way I am (not the same type of cancer but cancer nonetheless.) I am very close with my sister (18F) and my brothers (26m and 21m) and I know my diagnosis will absolutely break their hearts. I am from the UK but working in Norway and my siblings have been talking about coming to visit me and my girlfriend (25f)  after my sister has finished her exams. I don’t know if I have the heart to tell them. Especially my girlfriend.

She’s the best thing to ever happen to me. I never believed in soulmates until I met her. I don’t know If I can bring myself to tell her, especially after I’ve kept it a secret for 2 months. I just keep imagining the look on her face when I tell her I will be dead within a year. We recently moved in together and she’s been talking about our future together. She wants to get married and have kids in the next few years apparently. Part of me wants to elope with her now but I think it would be selfish and cruel in all honesty. I don’t want to leave her alone, I love her so much.

For someone who could die at any minute, I think I have been quite positive about the whole thing. I can’t let it ruin my final months with my girlfriend, family and friends. I could die at any minute, but so could anyone else who’s not dying of cancer. Most people don’t know when they will die and I do that’s the only difference. I just hope I live until my 25th birthday because my gf is planning a surprise party with my siblings flying over. She’s not the most stealthy person in the world lol. I hope I can see my family and friends together one last time.

I know some people may think it’s wrong that I haven’t told anyone about my diagnosis but I don’t want my final months to be a pity party or everyone acting as if I’m already dead. I saw the way everyone treated my mother before she passed and I refuse to be treated like that.

A few months ago i took my boyfriends phone, took a selfie of us kissing (nothing wild/sexual) and put it on his main story. After i gave his phone back, he went to edit who could see his story and took off one girl. Specifically a girl who he had a mutual crush on for a few years. I freaked out and asked him why he hid it from her and he said he was gonna hide it from all the people from church who follow him because he didn’t want them to see that since it’s “inappropriate”.

But essentially ever since I started watching porn when I was young, I've been using it very often. I always knew it was stupid to do and a waste of time and damaging, but I still did it. Now when I started dating my now girlfriend, I stopped for a little but resumed about a month into dating. I figured she probably did it as well, so it's nothing bad. I found out later that she never masturbates or uses porn, but it didn't really sound like she hated it. By this time I was like *okay, I should stop doing it if she doesn't do it.* I tried and I couldn't really quit. And me being the dumbass I am, I of course didn't communicate any of us this to my girlfriend. One time I tried quitting for a couple days, and I was struggling a bit. I felt like there was something I needed to release in me, and the only way to do it was to masturbate. Also here I should note that we would regularly have sex, but my drive to masturbate and my drive to have sex were like different things. I ended up cutting myself twice trying to quit, and my girlfriend of course was concerned so I stopped it without really connecting the dots that it was that imagined 'need to masturbate' that might've driven me to cut. Then one time while we were scrolling tiktok, one of the things came up and was like ""do you consider blank cheating?"" and one of those was porn. She said she did, and I kinda knew I fucked up big big time. I should've admitted then and there, but I am a dumbass. I've never lied to her about anything, but this is the one thing I hide, and of course it's something that is very serious to hide. Anyways, I go through bouts where I keep watching porn and trying to stop, but am never able to stop. About a month ago I tried drinking to try to keep that feeling down, but it didn't really help. I also told myself I'd go get professional help, but I always found an excuse not to go. It was either *I dont have money,* or *I dont have time*. I told myself I could quit on my own, but of course never did, and never told this to my girlfriend. 

Well, she asked me something about it, and she could tell that I had watched it while we were together. Now, obviously this breaks her heart, and she is barely talking to me rn. She says that she still loves me, but she's not sure if she can ever trust me again after this. She just headed home after a couple of hours of sitting together on the bed, mostly silent with me apologizing. I want to promise her the world, but I know that my words mean nothing to her right now. Does anyone have advice on how to help mend things/restore trust in our relationship? 

I'm going to stop this time, one way or another. I've let myself had excuse after excuse for way too far. I've ignored the research saying it's harmful, I've dismissed getting help, I've used up with too many excuses.

2022-08-24 05:10:35,4,True,1,"Proofreading this, this is a bit of a rant/vent as well. Seeking advice for my situation.

 We go way back. She's the last person from High School that I really talk to. We have a ton of good memories and trauma bonded when our friends either killed themselves or ghosted us, my parents divorce, and the pandemic. 

We were friends for at least 4 years before dating. I kind of just went along with being her boyfriend after a certain point and things kept getting more serious, doing more serious relationship things. 

We started having sex while she was in a relationship. I have been living with that thought that she may cheat on me in the back of my head for years, but ive managed that feeling and spoken with her about it. She says that was a different situation altogether now, and perhaps foolishly I trust it. She is a homebody and the way our schedules work I'm usually 100% sure she is either at home or work, though I don't mean to even know this info. I just do because it's the truth.

We are both potheads though she won't admit it. We have both smoked together nearly every night for over 3 years now. It's like a ritual. If I try to break it for an abstinence break she gets sad. I join, my impulse control fails, and I never start a sober streak. I have no problem with pot or pot users (being one duh) but come on, the brain isn't supposed to be handling that every day. Leaving her almost seems like the only way out since I lack self control and 

I moved into her apartment and split the rent. Now we live in a trailer owned by her dad, lot rent is only $80 a month. Its a good deal for a couple living on their own these days. 

We enjoy the same anime, youtubers, and video games. We don't really share any hobby except *talking* about making art. I used to be into art, gardening, camping, but I don't any more. Our sex life is dead basically. Last week we had sex for the first time in 2 months. This is generally attributed to her medical issues which ill mention in a moment. I'm a very sexual person it turns out and have been wanting to explore that further, as in have different experiences while I'm young.

She has really bad migraines, many food allergies, constantly low blood pressure causing fainting, and bad knees. I have adapted to it out of love but sometimes it really grinds on me. We set our smart bulbs to like 20% so it's not too bright, so often times it's hard for me to see anything fine. She has FMLA at her job and literally uses it 40%-50% of the days she is scheduled. She can't do anything about it and is clearly in pain, but it's frustrating being the only one going to work. Especially when she doesn't do a chore all day and just smokes pot and plays video games. 

Speaking of chores, due to the above conditions I do most of the housework. I am in the auto industry and come home beat after work but I still end up cooking/buying dinner most nights. I run laundry in the back while I do it. I've tried the whole ""let everything fall to ruin"" bit but she is fine with living in a general wreck. I wish to live better than this so I pick up after both of us on the weekends and have the house clean at the start of the week.

My social life has gone down the drain. I never go out on weekends because of her separation issues. I guess out of love I've never tried to make her uncomfortable. She deserves better than what she's been dealt and try to be the person she needs. She says she would have no idea what to do if I left her. She has abandonment issues as well, she broke down in tears when I once tried to go take a drive to blow off steam. She gets lonely and scared real easily. I just don't go and see my old friends and family nowadays or meet anyone new, and yes that's on me

The answer is probably to leave. Idk how to do it. I've never broken up with anyone, I've always been the one broken up with. Thinking about this eventually makes my stomach upset and throws me in an intense emotional bout of loving emotions towards her, asking myself why I'd ever leave this heaven we have made with our 2 cats cuddled next to us. I've been ebb and flowing between these two emotional startes and it hurts, I'm tired of it. I don't want to waste either of our time but as soon as I think about seriously maybe leaving the relationship,  I freak out and rescind all of my thoughts. I don't want to grow old and full of regrets, I don't want to string her along, but i dont want to throw away something we can save given what all weve been through and built.

New to reddit, beforee resding please note i will talk about self imagine and i know that can be triggering for some. 
Me and my boyfriend have been dating for two years. I'm 21 and he's 22. Weve been living together since Spring. Over the summer we had some issues, one of them being his trust in me. He talks to his therapist about a lot of things, and I know he talks to his therapist about me. His therapist suggested that we take some space from each other. My boyfriend didn't really give me a choice in the matter... I didn't want to work on things from a distance, but that's how he wanted it. So I did it because I didn't want anymore problems. So I drive across the country back to my parents house and stay there for 3 weeks.
3 weeks go by, we communicate and stay connected, and then he says he feels he's ready for me to come back. 
After I came back everything felt fine, except for now.
I cant pinpoint what's wrong. Whenever I ask what's wrong, I don't get a straight answer, sometimes never an answer at all. He's been acting cold towards me without explanation. I've asked what's wrong plenty of times and tried to get him to talk about it. 
There are some things that have been strange. He turns off his phone screen when I enter the room, when he's on the phone he goes to another room and closes the door. Just the other day he was on his phone with his mom and referred to me as a roommate. 
He mutes his microphone when he plays games so his friends ""can't hear what I'm saying"", he gets asked about me at work sometimes, and while at work yesterday he texted me; ""I'm tired of hearing about you from everyone in my life"".
I have bad body confidence, always have. I wantt to make him happy, so I built up the confidence to buy a lingere and surprise him in it. When I surprised him in it, hee looked at me, said ""Nice"", turned his game off, and got ready and left for work on his day off to ""check on things"". 
There are days where he comes home from work and I ask how his day was or try and engage in conversation, and im ignored completely.
When I ask for hugs or to cuddle, I'm ignored. Or he groans and says ""fine"" and gives me a side hug. He did tell me, and I quote, ""I don't want nor need to be hugged on all the time.""

2022-10-29 01:25:41,3,True,2,"Hello,

Tonight, my (35M) wife (32F) confessed that she didn’t want to have sex because she didn’t find me ‘hot’. I asked her if that meant she wasn’t attracted to me. She replied that she is attracted to who I am, but doesn’t find me sexually attractive.

I pressed her further, asking if she had ever found me sexually attractive. She said that she thinks we had “chemistry” in the past, but didn’t answer my question directly. I’m starting to suspect that she never found me attractive.

Here’s some background:

She is my first, and only, relationship. We started dating 5 years ago, when I was 30. I had never had a girlfriend before her, nor had I ever been on a date or had sex, kissed, or even held hands with a woman. 

I was, as you might expect, over the moon when our relationship started. No one had ever expressed any interest in me before. She seemed genuinely attracted to me. We had sex a for the first time a few months after our first date.

We got married in May of 2019. The first few years of our marriage were difficult. She moved out to my state, but got homesick after a while. We agreed that she could leave to go back and live with her parents, while I waited out the lease on our apartment and followed her back to that area after the lease expired.

That’s what we did. I didn’t see much of her in 2020 (Covid didn’t help). I followed her back to her home state in January of 2021. We found an apartment and moved back in together. By then, sex was infrequent. Any enthusiasm she might have had before was gone. 

Things haven’t gotten much better since then. We had some stretches of time this past year where we both had enthusiastic sex, but those events were few and far between. Lately, she’s even started groaning when I walk into the same room with her, afraid that I’ll come on to her. It crushes my soul when she does that.

Oddly, she got upset with me for masturbating the other day, so I’ve been trying to refrain from that. It’s frustrating for me, because she apparently doesn’t want me to masturbate or have sex. I’m not sure what I’m supposed to do. She has admitted to masturbating herself, though I’ve discovered that she only does so when I’m not around to avoid any involvement with me.

I’m beginning to fear that she wasn’t attracted to me to begin with. This is devastating to me. I haven’t always had the best self esteem, and my self image improved dramatically when we started dating. I had never believed that I was worthy of love or that someone could be attracted to me before that. Now, I’m starting to waver in that belief. 

I feel so alone. I love her more than I’ve ever loved anyone. I’m not capable of not loving her. I know that if I lose her, I’ll live the rest of my life alone. I lived alone throughout my twenties, and it was awful. I never want to go back to that.

I’m not sure what kind of advice I need. I guess I’d like to know if anyone else has found themselves in this situation and gotten through it. Should we consider couple’s counseling? Is there something I can do to become more attractive to my wife?

For the curious, I’m 5’9” (176 cm) and 150 lbs. I have a full head of hair. I’m not short, fat, or bald.

2022-10-29 01:34:20,3,True,1,"So, for context I am 23F and my boyfriend is 26M. Basically, this is the first year he’s living out in his own without being under a toxic home environment. Still, what happens at home affects him a lot because his family constantly calls him to fix everything for them. I won’t go into detail cause that’s a different story, but just know his mom and dad have relied and made him change his entire life to take care of them and now my boyfriend has decided not to give them so much of him anymore. 

During this, we’ve gotten closer but sexually very out of sync with one another. I used to struggle with libido but now it’s the opposite, he struggles with it because of the stress he’s endeared and the stress he still feels from them. We’ve talked about it and we just do anything sexual when we feel is appropriate and I’m clear that he consents. 

The other day, I decided to do somthing I haven’t done in a very long time, send him nudes. It’s been a long time since I’ve felt him desire my body and I felt so hot cause I dyed my hair copper, I wanted to have that feeling of desire again. I sent him a sneak peak that was fully clothed and he was so sweet and he said I could send the rest. But after I sent the rest , and all he really said back was “I enjoy this, thank you for taking the time taking these for me” and well I felt really bummed that that was it… I asked him after a few hours went by if that was all he had to say? I spent hours putting on sexy clothes and taking so many different angles. I ended up getting mad at him, and kinda treated him coldly. The next day I was still upset and I told him I was, and he revealed to me that he doesn’t know what to say to me and that he thought his response was enough. He apologized and said this:

“I shouldn't make you feel undesired so i apologize. I thought i did not do that but i inadvertantly did. It was appreciated i just can't do a lot of things the same. I lost almost a lot that made me, me. I feel like i'm operating in a blur and i'm trying to balance it all, i am sorry i failed you yesterday. But i don't know i thought it was okay to say thank you and i enjoyed them. That is just how my brain works, in my mind showing appreciation was enough and i do more later when we are together”

I really need advice on how to move forward with this. I just want him to understand he needs to communicate with me that he is feeling that way, but at the same time understand saying thank you to nudes that I took for you to me isn’t enough. They meant a lot to me to give you, I’d like more praise and hype. But if I would’ve known that’s also how he felt, I wouldn’t have sent them and had those expectations in the first place.

2022-10-29 01:54:06,2,True,3,"I recently broke up with my boyfriend of 8 months. When I first met him we were both just lonely people on valentines day. Funny enough we were just dissing how trash the holiday was until he finally asked me if I wanted to spend the rest of it with him. I said yes.

He was so kind and cute at first. Although 2 years older than me he was sorta childlike and anti social. He told me his exes left him in short amount of time and I couldn't understand why anyone would leave such an adorable and nice man. 

After a while of dating I finally let them do the deed with me. It was awkward but since I liked him I didn't mind. After that he wanted to do it everyday. I give into pressure rather easily so I gave in. After a while I couldn't possibly carry on with it anymore so I asked if we could do something besides it. He got so upset when I said I didn't want to do it. That sadness turned into aggression and screaming at me. He apologized after and hugged and kissed me a lot, but this turned into a frequent thing everytime I said didn't want to. 

Then one day he just gave up asking me and forced it on me despite me saying repeatedly I didn't want to. After he finished he looked at my face of crying and fear. 

After that he apologized so much and after a while he calmed down. I never had another issue with them. They were genuinely trying to change after that event, but I could never forget what happened in the past and lost my attraction to them. They begged me to stay with them and start a family with them but I couldn't. The damage was done and I didn't want to date them anymore. I said I'd stay and support them as a friend, but as a last resort they threatened to kill themselves if I didn't stay. Since they've already used that line on me a couple of times while we were dating It no longer worked on me. 

I now understand why his exes left so early.

2022-11-02 22:31:39,430,True,584,"I've been dating this woman for a few months. In many ways she's one of the best girlfriends I've had, and I think that we make a great couple in terms of our shared interests and goals and personalities. I find her physically attractive when she's clothed, but once we started fooling around I noticed a couple things that keep killing the mood. Specifically, her breath is usually bad (not food smell, but rotten smell) and she has an unusually hairy lower back. The breath thing is perplexing because she has good personal hygiene and I know she regularly visits the dentist for cleanings. And I've read that the hair might be an indication of a medical condition, although I do not know her medical history.

Her breath is distracting when we're making out; I find myself trying to breathe through my mouth to avoid it, but just the knowledge that it smells is still a problem. I also try pretending the back hair's not there (she's a natural blonde, so it's not always visibly noticeable), but sometimes I'll accidentally brush my fingers across it and it makes my skin crawl.

I'm able to ""perform"" and bring her to climax, but I've never been able to reach my own orgasm with her. (And she has begun to notice.) I do not have ED and she's the only woman I've slept with where I was NEVER able to cum; I'm simply too put off.

Maybe it's closed-minded of me to be turned off by these things, but I feel actual physical revulsion during these moments. (I'm not trying to be grossed out. I want to enjoy it!) As much as I love her, I can't see how I can go much longer without sexual fulfilment, so I figure we need to talk about these things. BUT HOW?

I don't want to hurt her, and I don't want to make her feel insecure. I want her to know how much I do care for her and hope we can figure something out. What's a good way to bring something like this up? (What kind of setting, how to frame it, etc.)

EDIT: As a veteran redditor I am well aware that ""beside the point"" is a frequent destination for many of my peers. I hoped my post would elicit some practical relationship advice (and I actually got some- thanks!), but for those of you who seem to think I don't know what mammals are, here's some more information: In my 30+ years as a sexually active adult I've had intimate experiences with a probably higher-than-average number of women. I've even dated women who didn't shave at all, and had nothing but great times with them.

Here are a couple of photos of women who don't shave (I would consider both photos safe-for-work, but they obviously show a fair amount of skin so be warned):

There is visible hair on the armpits and on the legs, but not so much on the torso. The unshaven women I've dated in the past had hair distribution similar to this. When we get to the intimate areas, most of the ""hairy"" women I've been with had very little visible hair on their buttocks (a couple were even naturally hairless in the butt crack, despite having a pronounced frontal bush) and none on their back.

My girlfriend has a large patch of visible half-inch-length hair across most of her lower back. She's the only woman I've ever been with like this.

I (18M) just started my freshman year of college with 62 credits to my name from taking classes at local community college, and this is the only thing I have going for me. I didn’t any scholarships because my SAT score was a 1200 and I needed a 1210, and come to my surprise at the college I go to, they give out almost full rides for high SAT scores. So literally everyone I am friends with talks about how they don’t pay a dime or they get refund checks or their parents cover the rest. I am so fucking tired of hearing about how I messed up my entire life all because of one stupid test. My parents don’t help out with anything, they don’t give me any money, emotional support, information on loans, guidance, nothing at all. I can’t register for the classes I want because I have a hold on my account because I STILL OWE MONEY. I can’t get credit card, private loan, or anything involving credit because my parents have bad credit and I need a co signer. My credit is going to be horrible because I have loans in my name for school.

My laptop is cracked and dies in 30 minutes, meanwhile I see people with brand new MacBooks, gaming computers and desktops. My car is fucked up, no AC, bad tire pressure sensors, busted radio, weird sticky shit on the dash, need an oil change, new spark plugs (i think, it just starts shaking when I accelerate). I see kids with nice cars that their parents helped them buy or bought for them. My car insurance is extremely high because my parents have horrible driving records. Nothing is going right in my life and the jealousy of others is throwing me over board. I wish could get the things I wanted for the first time in my life. 

I don’t have any money for basic necessities because I have to pay for school out of pocket.  I can’t afford a haircut or deodorant, and defiantly not shampoo and conditioner. My friends parents I pay for their off campus apartment, brand new car, gas, food, literally anything. I am so jealous of anything that is Better than what I have. I have to work part time at a job I hate just to get by for school.

There’s so much more like my roommate being fucking stupid and takes nothing into account. I didn’t get the grade I wanted even after studying for 20 hours, when people barely studied and got a near perfect score. I don’t have any experience in my major meanwhile there are people who know way more than I do and will probably take the internship opportunities I want in the future.

2022-01-01 16:14:33,7,True,0,"My friend (26F) Jenna and I (26NB) have been friends since we were born, and I mean it literally- We were born a few days apart and our mothers are extremely good friends so naturally, we became friends. I literally trust her with my life and would do anything for her... until now I guess. I recently got primary custody of my 2 year old, Delia (fake name). It was really hard and tough, probably the roughest time in my life. My ex (32NB) was abusive and I'm thankful I got away from them. I wish I could say Jenna was there for me but... Like... No. She wasn't, to put it lightly.

Jenna is a furry- and I guess in a way so am I. Due to the distance Jenna and I have between us since she had to move to a completely different country for work, we primarily chat on a service called Discord. We are in a few servers together and call each other daily. One of these servers is a massive roleplay server for furries. I've always roleplayed on forums online as a form of escapism and joined this server for Jenna- I enjoy being able to create characters and draw art for them and it honestly sounded like a fun thing to do alongside her. God I wish I could have traveled back in time and told myself to never have done it. Jenna is... OBSESSIVE about her furry characters. To the point where she just talks about them TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. I can't even talk about my day. I can't say what's up without her telling me about her woodpecker fursona and the hijinks this character is in right now. I'm glad she's passionate but for five years straight it's been like this. If we're not talking about her characters, we're talking about OUR characters interacting. Our characters are in a deep storyline that's been going on for like 3 years now, and there's been a few developments on her end that have gotten... weird. I'll get to that.

Well, because of Delia, I've wanted to be a better parent and spend more time with her, she's my everything. Due to that, I had to put aside roleplaying to focus on making a better home for her. Jenna immediately started noticing and complaining that I wasn't around anymore. Complaining that Delia was always with me. Complaining that I never had free time for her. Jenna messaged me saying she has felt the need to stage an intervention for me to ""talk to my friends more often"" (I do) and ""stop putting all my time into Delia."" I told her I straight up am just busy making the home more stable for the time being. Jenna said she didn't like that she wasn't a priority anymore and that I never have time to roleplay with her anymore, and that I could hire a babysitter for Delia every other day. That's where I blew up. I told her I didn't want to prioritize her explicit fetish furry roleplay that she's kind of forced me into over my own daughter, and that ever since this roleplay stuff started, it's all she's ever cared about. She's never once comforted me when I was being abused, and whenever I have expressed that I want to talk about something else, she'd say she wasn't interested in talking about that. I also said that it's ridiculous of her to even think of complaining about this, she knows how hard it was for Delia and I and to PUT A ROLEPLAY above it all of all things was asinine. Before I hung up, I said ""I don't want to talk to you for a while. It feels like I'm a wall to you and you don't care about me as a person.""

It had been a week and Jenna messaged me saying if we could talk- I hoped to god she considered what I had said and I said sure, I called and she picked up. I hoped to the wrong deity it seems because immediately she said ""I want an apology"" and I was like... Pardon???? She said that I had hurt her feelings by berating her special interest, and that I never have taken her into account. I kind of laughed hard and was like you're joking right? And she wasn't. She was dead serious. She said I wasn't being considerate of her and her feelings, and that I put my own interests before hers with Delia, and the friendship we have had for the last 26 years feels shattered due to my actions and absence. I hung up. I couldn't even believe what I was hearing, and after a few missed calls from her, I messaged her saying that I thought she was better than this.

I don't even know how to handle this. All this drama over the fact I won't roleplay nsfw furry stuff with her. I want to spend time with her, I miss screensharing our favourite shows together and playing other games and being someone else besides ""the person who roleplays her character's possible love interest."" I miss talking like a normal person. It feels so weird to see the Jenna I saw to grow up to be this intelligent woman become someone who just tunnel visions like this and forgets there's other people who are busy. She's been messaging me nonstop telling me I don't put our friendship and our roleplay first and that makes me at fault, but I feel like my child NEEDS to come first. What do I do? What do I say? I seriously don't want to lose her but I can't take this anymore.

2022-01-21 01:49:24,8,True,1,"So this is a bit of a weird one. I had to make a throwaway account for this.

For most of my childhood I was pretty funny-looking. I have a very pronounced jaw and chin which got me a lot of nicknames and insults in school. But as I grew up, it became a more definitive part of my face. I always thought it made me off-putting to look at but over the past year I've gotten some compliments about it so my self confidence is definitely growing.

I've been a virgin all my life, last year at New Year's I made out with a girl I knew for some time at a local club and she confessed to me. But to make it more awkward she already had a boyfriend who she had no intention of breaking up with. She wanted to love me in secret which I didn't really approve. And she had quite a shitty personality, so I ghosted her for most of this year despite her constant text messages and advances.

But now comes along my step-uncle's wife who he divorced little more than a week ago. I've known her for a large portion of my life, since my childhood. She visits a few times a year. 

But, she is probably the most beautiful person I've met in my life. She starred in the Miss South Africa a few years ago and won fourth place. Easily a 9/10, beautiful straight blonde hair with a perfect symmetrical face. For privacy purposes I'll be calling her Caroline.

Caroline has given me strange signals since I was a kid. Just under a year ago she said I was becoming 'surprisingly attractive' which I found hard to believe because I just seem to get uglier as the days pass. She practices dance moves with me a lot but she is extremely physical about it. Grabs my waist and pulls me around like she's dancing with a puppet doll. She grabbed me a few times on my crotch while practising but she was fairly inebriated and afterwards asked me what my 'vibe' is with girls but I just responded nonchalantly even though she asked me that several times that night. Just chalked it up to her being her hyper-social weird self.

I've obviously fantasised about Caroline for a bit but was never seriously interested in her since she's essentially a minor celebrity. I've never been quite sure about what she does for work as her answer is constantly changing but she seems to be rich nonetheless.

Anyway, she flew here to my step-mom's house yesterday. Caroline's staying over for a few days. She got a new boyfriend VERY recently (They quite literally met up 2 days ago) but she's giving me some extreme hints that she is not fond of this man.

I chatted him up a bit and I talked about my 'old' girlfriend and he gave me what he called a man-to man-conversation. He's extremely misogynistic. He called Caroline a 'tief' which is slang in my language for a bitch or a prostitute. Said women like it if you insult them because they try harder to get your approval. He's a pro dirtbiker and says he's the best in the country, but by god is he ugly. He gives me psycho vibes. His whole body is wrinkled and scarred like a fucking war veteran and tattooed to hell and back. His face says he's 60 but he tells me he's just under 40. He seems to like me though.

Here comes the real fucking strange part. We were having a social party yesterday to celebrate her arrival like normal. She had a huge argument in the kitchen with her boyfriend (No clue what it was about, didn't care to listen) and immediately storms to the backyard where I was smoking a cigg, about two meters from her boyfriend She told me, roughly translated, she ""thinks she is in love with me a little bit"" (""Ek dink ek is 'n bietjie in lief met jou"") and then the conversation immediately gets cut off by her invading boyfriend who luckily didn't hear a word.

This stirred me up a bit but not in a good way. I'm not interested at all in a relationship with a woman who raised me as a child and was my semi-rolemodel. Moreso, it would be even worse trying to explain it to my family or her sociopathic boyfriend. So I just let it go that night. She did a lot of small talk and more weird dancing practice but thats just the norm.

The next morning there was another drama. Caroline's boyfriend wanted to leave early and fly back to his apartment, and wanted Caroline to join him, a huge argument ensued and they parted ways. Barely listened barely cared. My parents are out to work as well. I just sat out back smoking like I normally do.

Caroline was already sitting out back so I joined her. She asked me the weird question again, of what girls I like. This time I was actually earnest and we had a fairly in-detail discussion. She said she likes being the alpha in a relationship but it seems pretty contrary to how she actually acts. I enjoy biparistan relationships without hierarchy . She didn't seem very interested in what I have to say, but what comes after was really mind boggling.

She changed the topic really quickly to sex positions (She talks about sex a lot. Not with me though) and since I've never had sex I just gave her the truthful response to which she asked me what position I'd like to be [in.](https://in.At) At this point she started getting physical again and what started as a shoulder hug went waist-down and she was fondling my dick under my clothes. I was getting visibly erect and this seriously disturbed me since I kind of saw her as a family member. I just stood up immediately saying some half-hearted shit about needing to take a shower. Haven't said a word to her today yet. Not sure what do to now.

2022-01-21 01:52:54,4,True,2,"Hi all. I’m new to Reddit and just recently started reading entries on Instagram so don’t understand the format/interface/community rules/etc. but thought I’d come here to ask a question. My (31F) husband (35M) might be asexual? We’ve been together for 6 years and recently got married. A little background about our relationship:

We were each other’s first serious relationship and each other’s first sexual partner. He waited almost three weeks to kiss me (his first kiss!) and we waited another seven months to have penetrative sex (we did hand and oral about two months into our relationship which was new to both of us). It was both our first time so we wanted to make sure we were both ready. 

After our first time we started to have sex regularly, almost every weekend since we lived sorta far from each other and only see each other on the weekends. I very very much enjoyed having a partner as pleasuring myself became exhausting (who knew women had libidos haha). And it was great sex (I mean I couldn’t really compare since he’s my first and only) considering I would cum every time we would have sex. We tried different positions since we didn’t know what we liked (again first timers) but found that we both liked the cowgirl position. I’d always cum and even now we have to end in this position for me to cum. 

When we moved into our first place together I though yay! I get to do all this domestic stuff (Cooking! Grocery shopping! Laundry!) with my partner and have amazing sex anytime we want because we’ll see each other everyday and no roommates to be wary of. Well for the three years we lived just the two of us, we really only had sex on Saturday or Sunday mornings. I get that weeknights are tough since our commutes were anywhere from 45 mins - 1.5 hrs and on top of cooking, cleaning, working out, showering, etc. there wasn’t enough time. But at night he said he was too tired to perform and some weekends he would wake up so late from playing video games all night it would be time for lunch or running errands. I started to keep track of when we would have sex since we had a mild pregnancy scare (I was about ten days late) and also to see how often we were having sex and just to make sure I wasn’t losing my mind that we only had sex on weekend mornings. Once I started tracking it I was able to see the pattern and how often we were having sex. Our once/week started to dwindle down to once/month. 

And now that we moved and have roommates I’ll be lucky to get him to have sex once a month (right now it’s going on five weeks since we last had sex). I know he is afraid of them hearing us, but we used to have sex when I lived with my parents and he didn’t have a problem with it. But I’ll even settle for a quick fingering or just making out like teenagers. 

Whenever we have the house to ourselves, which can be seldom, I want to take advantage of that and have sex. But he has to be in the mood. And I am always the one to have to initiate sex. He’s never initiated sex. I’ve tried a few times to wait it out and have him start something but it’ll be week six or seven and I’ll cave cause he looks so sexy and we’ll be cuddling and I just can’t take it. 

Our last few acts have been pretty much kiss, cowgirl, and done. All within about 15-20 mins. It’s been kinda prescriptive and not intimate or sultry or romantic. 

We’ve talked about sex and I’ve straight-up asked him if he liked sex. He said he does and enjoys it but isn’t confident (not sure if its his body or moves or what). I’m not sure if he knows about being asexual. This is what I’m trying to work to without making him feel insecure or awkward or underperforming. Again when we have sex he’s very much into it, but I’m not sure if that’s society’s pressure of him thinking since he’s a man he has to like sex.

I want to be appreciated and just feel attractive and sexy. Like he has so much desire for me he can’t keep his hands off me and just wants to kiss me. That has never happened in our relationship and I’ve just dismissed it because he’s so amazing at other things. It seemed trivial to be tied up on something as unimportant as lust when he’s caring, funny, responsible, respectable, loyal, sensitive, organized, driven, supportive, everything that I want in a partner. But it’s affecting my self esteem that maybe the extra weight I’ve put on is unattractive. Or that my non-typical girly girl (I don’t wear makeup, am helpless in a fashion sense, terrible at flirting, can’t really wink or give suggestive eyebrow wiggles when trying to seduce) personality isn’t attractive. I think if I can understand that he just views sex differently or doesn’t have sexual attraction then we can work how to support his needs and my needs going forward.

I just clicked on apples automatically generated ""My Favorites"" list, since I don't listen to any profane songs(or so I thought). About an hour and a half goes by and all the music is pretty good, and then we enter a rush... Im working at light speed and there are a whole lot of people in the building, so I don't have much room to do much else—until this song comes on, and I hear the first riff; my mind is racing and I yell ""Oh Shit!"" and sprint over to the auxiliary cable to pause the song, but not until ""18 Naked cowboys in the showers at Ram Ranch, big hard throbbing cocks etc. etc."" I skipped the song and couldn't work for like 5 minutes from laughing so hard.

Also, the reason it was on my favorites is because my friends like messing with me(and I with them) so we play it at random times haha.

I will start out by being accountable for my actions. About 2 years ago I was abusing alcohol to cope with things that have happened in my life as well as isolation from the pandemic. It got to the point where I did a 30 day outpatient group program. Was probably one of the best decisions I made in my life. It was nothing forced and a decision I made for me. I ended up graduating the program, learning about my relationship with alcohol and really just getting an opportunity to learn about feelings I’ve buried for my entire life.

I also attend intensive therapy every other week with a ptsd and trauma specialist. Where for the first time in my life I have opened up about childhood physical, sexual and verbal abuse. It has been one of the hardest things to dive into and I was reluctant at first but again another one of the best choices I’ve made in my life.

My therapist says that my trauma is the most extensive he has ever worked with and I’ve been one of his most forthcoming clients and he is a veteran who works with veterans.

I’m currently working with an attorney whose fighting a disability case for me and also the subject of going to an adult group home or adult foster care might be an option.

I’ve reached a point where I can’t have relationships with any family because no one else can be accountable about the past, violence towards me just a lot of things. But i can be accountable where I’ve been wrong. I also have trouble visiting family or going places due to flashbacks of violence towards me.

My mom and family are determined to make me the one and only problem.

My symptoms of ptsd make it hard for me to live independently and i will be in the process of getting a service animal that my care providers are on board for.

2022-04-05 05:28:32,35,True,12,"Hello all, I am shakily writing this out of anger and horror and also on mobile so excuse my mistakes. 

I just started talking to this girl who I hit it off with so well that I stayed over at her house for 3 days straight. 

She told me that the neighbor beats his kid, and that she's screamed at the guy next door doing it multiple times but also doesn't want to call CPS because of orphanages in the corrupt way that the kids get treated there too.

She had fallen asleep tonight and I was just watching a show and kind of trying to fall asleep. Myself and I started hearing the kid screaming next door and sounding like he was hitting him and I heard him saying stuff like ""you better watch it boy! and all this shit and so I wrote a note and I put it on his car and I banged on his door like I was the cops, twice. 

But at this point I'm really fucking traumatized because I've never actually experienced anything like this. Thankfully, my parents never did anything like that to me and so the trauma and the horror of this whole situation is literally just gotten me in a heap on the floor and I don't really fucking know what to do because I can't fucking stand knowing that that kid is literally being beaten to a pulp every night just because he might be a little autistic but here's literally an 8-year-old kid next door being fucking beaten and it's fucking killing me. 

Please, someone, help me get this guy locked up and his kid in a better place. 

Thank you

TL;DR: The neighbor next door beats his kid and I don't want to call CPS for fear of him getting put in a shitty adoption ring. Please help me help him.

EDIT: 4/4/22 I have called CPS on the parents. Will update as I know more. Thanks for answering, all of you. I was just very traumatized and all I thought of in that moment was just to post here.

EDIT 2: 4/5/22 WE HAVE A ROOMMATE THAT HAS CONNECTIONS TO CPS YOU GUYS. I am not sure how much of the process I will be able to update you on but this will be a long, drawn out process but this roommate has not even moved in yet and I was recalling the story and she was like ""You do know I'm a mandated reporter and can access ways to help get around the whole fucked up system of whatever CPS does."" I fucking hugged her and BAWLED. I mean BAWLED. She gave me a big hug and is going to help organize the whole process. I am so relieved you guys and so hopeful that you and all of you have been so supportive of me and being able to get past the whole ""out of the frying pan and into the fire"" adage, because of how many stories we've both heard about of how kids are mistreated in foster homes and just honestly at that level it almost feels like a Catch-22. 

She also has extreme anxiety surrounding the whole process happening every day but then seeing them out in the open and knowing where she lives (and I am standing up for her in this whether that be biased or not) because you don't have any fucking idea how much she's been through herself and so her having trauma and feeling like it's happening again and if they found out that she called CPS that she literally has to live there while they think that she did that? Do you understand how terrifying that shit is when you hear a man and a woman BEATING and screaming!!! at their 8 year old son. That shit is rough. I was a little upset at first that she hadn't either but even her talking about it spun her into a panic attack so yeah. Don't judge before you know the whole story. 

I banged on this guy's door as loud as I fucking could until my hand was red and at least shut the man up and spared maybe a minute or two of trauma that that poor innocent child is soaking up like a fucking sponge. I am so sorry I am saying fuck so much but I'm so utterly angry, I'm literally weeping as I write this. 

It was the mother this morning. She was screaming at her child at the top of her lungs and her was screaming and crying as well. My girlfriend and I banged on the walls some more and fucking just hugged each other and sobbed. I am so over this shit. 

Also looked like the woman and the man were outside the parking complex as I left and I saw them both and I tell you I was too angry to say anything at all. I just stared them down because I know what is coming. WHAT IS STRANGE IS THAT IT WAS TWO CARS AND THEY WERE BOTH THERE WATCHING ME LEAVE. These fuckers are fucked and literally they have such a fucking outward mask, it was almost like they'd be the ones to smile and wave and at you, with their fancy fucking Volkswagen Bug and his work truck. I couldn't take pictures of either of those plates but the plate that I did get his license plate caught in a video after I banged on their door. 

Who knows, they might be fucking moving out to get away from the cops; but I got that fucker's plate man.

He said that he has boundaries , he was mean and he left. After that I had a huge emotional breakdown, I felt like a predator. I only wanted to be gentle with him.

We lost touch for a while. Then when I was 20 and she was 16 at the cousin's birthday. I was super high and more than a bit drunk. She was a bit drunk. I was happy to see her after sucks a long time and wanted to catch up on stuff with her. I'm the party I recurved some signals from her (or so I believe) like sexy glances and weird hand touchings and I seemed a bit of flirting. I immediately feel in love and thought what would happen if we got together. At that moment she was too young so I said nothing.
   Then the next morning our other oldest friend told me he has gotten crush on her as well. I said talk to the cousin and then pursue if he's ok. They were closer in she and I loved them both and wanted them to be happy. Stuff happened there. She wasn't interested. He did some shitty stuff I'm not getting into. The girl and I got closer over the years. I still didn't tell her about my feelings.
   Until last year my cousin, to whom I was very close to (we were basically childhood friends) died of leukemia. I was broken. The only reason I could almost bounce back and get better over a *long* period of time was her.
   A week after she passed away I was talking to this girl (now 19, me 23). She told me she wanted to tell me sth she couldn't. I had nothing to lose so I told her I wanted to be in a relationship with her. She said yes, but was hesitant bc she was a virgin and wasn't ready for sex. I said it was ok and we would think about that later if we realized the relationship would actually work. I honestly meant it. We got together.
   It wasn't perfect, but I was super in love. About 10 months in the relationship she started getting colder and more distant. I kept pushing for her to tell me what was wrong. I told her what made her unhappy about so if I could fix I would *actually* try. She kept putting the conversation off until I have her a deadline to decide what she wanted. She knew where I was and what wanted bc I'd told her, a serious long term relationship. We broke up.

Last night we were talking about why we broke up and she told me it was bc she felt pressure for sex and that she felt guilty bc in all my past relationships I had sex (not much, I'm not a lady's man). I told her there was nothing to tell guilty about. That I was waiting for about at least 1 or 2 years into the relationship to broke the subject bc I didn't want our friendship to go to sh*t. I told her I still loved her and she started tearing up.

The question is:if she's still in love with me, do I pursue?

Ps. I was *not* perfect in the relationship. I was recently diagnosed with chronic depression mixed with anxiety, so I'm far from perfect. On the other side I try to communicate and it's very hard for her bc she's very introverted.

So some background info: we have been together for 3 years, living together for over 2. We have a great relationship, both still deeply in love and very caring for another and supportive (with the exception of this topic, here we just can’t see eye to eye). We do try to communicate a lot, so everything I will tell you in the following has been talked about, however we are just going in circles each time.


He has a high sex drive. Our sex is amazing and I love it! But I tend to have a fluctuating sex drive. Nothing to do with my love for him, which he disagrees on… (He can be a bit insecure, even though I clearly tell him that is not the problem) It just is like that, it always has been. Maybe due to hormonal fluctuations in my cycle? (I am not on hormonal birth control, but when I was it did mess with my libido even more) Can’t explain it but it has been that way forever. 
Just to elaborate: my “low” sex drive lead to an average of about twice a week. Tbh, I don’t even consider that so low based on inputs I get from other female friends. He disagrees.
When he complains about it it makes me feel bad and I get the feeling of being pressured into sex. You see, I am somewhat of a stubborn person and this pressure usually backfires to even less sex.  

Again, this problem only occurs a few times a year when my sex drive is at a low again but it annoys me that we still are having this conversation after 3 years! Just patiently wait a few days and it’s all sunshine and roses again…
How do I get him to understand that that’s not the end of the world and that his words pressure and hurt me? (Literally told him all of the above and he is still currently in the other room sulking that our cuddle session tonight didn’t end in sex)

Heads up: I love this man, apart from this reoccurring situation he is super respectful, mature and supporting. Breaking up is not on the table.

Also: while I would love couples therapy or even separate therapy we are not in a financial position to do so. Hence, I turn to strangers on Reddit… Probably not the best but I am at my wits’ end.

It is suffocating. He has formed his whole identify off of these diagnoses. I live with him, aswell as my partner, we’ve reached out for help and we’ve only now realised as we are away on the trip that his symptoms all match up with sociopathy. 

He doesn’t have empathy and goes to any bounds to get the attention he craves, once he even made us walk in on a SH scene (with both my partner and I have lost best friends to that and a history myself). 

We are considering moving out, but is so frustrating that he flaunts all his mental illnesses (sounds horrible to say) but a lot of which he does not even have. 

Every two weeks a new thing, and he SETS it up perfectly to match up. For example: he will leave his diary upon to a page he wants us to see in the house, he will set up situations like going out just so he can say his anxiety wouldn’t let him go inside the venue etc. 

This really hurts and is infuriating, as my partner has intense social anxiety and when we had to leave together as she was having a breakdown, he yelled and got mad with no understanding but now expects us to be his number one support. 

He’s cut off everyone else, all friends, he doesn’t open up to his family. Nothing. 
He is at home 100% of the time if he is not working. We feel like parents to a child. 

If you look at my previous post about this exact issue, it was that we thought he was going to try for schizophrenia but it’s anxiety for now.

2022-06-30 00:55:17,1356,True,13822,"This past weekend the kiddo and I went on a two day camping trip for some father-son bonding time. My wife doesn’t like camping herself at all anymore and doesn’t even appreciate our kid and I going. This is a big hobby for me and I want to share with my son. Usually we argue a lot about my trips especially if I request to bring our child, but this time she was oddly cooperative about the whole thing, but still insisted she wouldn’t join us. I was surprised but didn’t question anything because I was so excited that she was finally allowing us to go and I didn’t want her to change her mind. I thought we had finally found a common ground and the arguments were ending! 

I was wrong.

We had a great trip and returned back on Monday. We expected to come home to an empty house as my wife should have been at her office for a few more hours. I walked the kid up to his room as he was exhausted and ready for a nap. After, I walked into our bedroom to find a naked man in my bed. I recognized him as my wife’s coworker whom I have met numerous times at her work functions. At first I was in disbelief and even wondered if I was in the right house. Then my wife walked out of our bathroom, also naked, and I had no more doubts. She looked petrified when she saw me. I have never been so angry. I yelled at the dude to get out of my house so I could speak to my wife. He grabbed his clothes and left. Then we started arguing. I never yell at my wife, we always want to keep things civil for our son but I was so hurt I was screaming. Then my wife decides to get defensive saying it’s not her fault that I am barely around and camp so much, even though I hardly go on trips anymore because she doesn’t like it. She says “that’s what drove me to do this, your neglect to this family.” I was in tears at that point. I just don’t understand how her cheating could be my fault. When I turned around to leave my son was standing in the doorway and I felt terrible for yelling. I quickly consoled him but my wife snapped at me again telling me to get my hands off him. Now she won’t speak to me and says I can’t see MY child until I apologize. Apologize for what? She said we could go on this trip. She planned to cheat and that kills me. It makes me wonder if she has done this before. 

I’m stuck staying with my parents right now. I don’t know what to do, I want to see my son. I’m worried I really scared my child and of course I would apologize to him, just not my wife but maybe it is my fault.

TL;DR - My wife cheated on me while my son and I were on a camping trip, she says it’s my fault for camping “too much.”

Update: I’m back home now, decided it was best to get here ASAP. Things are quiet but I’m relieved to be back in the same space as my son. Thank you all for the advice and kind words, it means so much. I’ll keep you all updated if you’d like.

If anything he's very liberal with his sexuality and will and would have intimacy w almost anyone since there doesn't have to be an emotional aspect of it for him. I am quite the opposite, I've had my fair share of sexual encounters that didn't leave me feeling great in the long term so jeff is the only one I actually trust and enjoy it with. For some background, I have seen my mom being cheated on for many years by my dad. He's a great dad just not a great partner, so this instilled in me a very deep insecurity. I also have a sister who is absolutely gorgeous and I found myself locked in a position where I felt less than in society's eyes. I'm currently working on my self-esteem and the one who has helped me the most was jeff. He's a truly amazing person, never met someone so transparent and understanding and we've gone through our issues in the past and have always prevailed stronger as friends. He's helped me become a person I'm proud of, I have also done the same for him, and always stood with me when things were rough. Towards the beginning of our friendship, we were more sexual and decided that worked but I was under the impression that we were to be exclusive. A couple of months go by and we finally talk about it and that's where I found out that he wanted other sexual relationships. And I didn't. He always was supportive in anything I did even sex with other people but I was/am still so insecure. I thought I finally found someone that loved me for me and help me find my sexuality. I felt betrayed and sad that he wouldn't find me as enough to the person who told me he loved me more than anyone else. We talked more and decided to try exclusivity for my sake since in his own words ""it doesn't matter too much for me"". Sadly that didn't work out too well after a couple of tries and decided to open up to other partners.
I should also mention we're both in community college and have been for a while, he graduated from high school last year and I got my GED at 14. Right now he's off with family and once we both get back to Fall classes he might be engaging with someone else sexually. And that breaks my heart since sex for me is more emotional than physical. We've had multiple conversations about it, and every time we decide it'll work out, I'm not sure if our judgment is clouded because we're attached to the hip. He really is just the perfect sexual partner, attentive, loving, nurturing, and understanding and our energies mesh so well. Should I give this up for a life where I'm not constantly stressed about his sexual encounters, go through intense self-reflection, stay? I'm just so tired and I need help.

2022-07-06 03:54:22,3,True,17,"Obligatory this didn’t happen today but, after a blissful 5 years of ignorance, my mom told me after I virtually wrestled it out of her. Please revel in my absolute horror.

Me and my mom were Facetiming after work today as we normally do. The conversation started so completely innocent - I told her about my trip to the gym, we talked about her 4th of July plans, abortion rights debate, you know, the normal stuff. At some point we talked about me living at her house, which I haven’t done for a while now. I bring up that we never really had any “sex” talks and that I kinda grew up believing it was a bit taboo. She agreed, which begged the followup question - when did you first know I was sexually active?

As soon as I asked this, my mom’s smile dropped off her face. She has incredibly expressive eyes and the moment she looked away I knew it was something really, really bad. Being the pest I normally am, I began prodding and throwing forth what I thought it was - did you hear me? Nope. Did you see condoms or something? Na-da. Did you see something? I saw this woman pale completely and immediately started to cringe. I offered a few times I could’ve been caught - times where I wasn’t as careful as I ought to have been for someone living at home with their parent - and she remained completely silent.

Then - “Anxious_, I was sworn to secrecy.” 

That sets off about a thousand alarm bells in my head and at this point I raise the heat. I’m pretty much all but begging her to tell me what the hell she’s talking about and panicking a little. She then proceeds to tell me the most tragic Greek tragedy I’ve ever (unwillingly) participated in:

My mom and my dad are now divorced, but several years ago this obviously was not the case. As is such in toxic relationships, they often did a tango between “you’re cheating on me” and the aggressive “you have no proof!”, which was a delightful dance I frequently witnessed. As I’ve learned, this was a near weekly occurrence with my dad being the primary instigator with very little evidence to back up his incessant claims. There was one occurrence in particular that had left my dad short and cold towards
my mom for about a week and the whole situation begged for an intervention.  

Well, on some fateful day in 2018, my dad rushes to my mom, adamant that he did in fact know she was cheating on him and, this time, he carried the definitive burden of proof. My mom, obviously confused and sure in her fidelity, challenged his accusation stating that there was absolutely no way he had anything as she had not been with or talked to anyone else. But, oh no, my dad knew as he had found a video of my mom with another guy. In bed. Getting funky. 

My mom didn’t need to look at the video to be certain it wasn’t her. However, likely in an attempt to reveal his own mishap, she questioned him, asking “where did you find this video?” Snakily I’m sure he responded with “the iPad, of course!”

We owned one iPad in our family. I want you to take a wild guess at who it belongs to (the answer is D - ALL FUCKING MINE). That’s right folks, my dad saw a video of me getting down and dirty with my ex boyfriend as, in my naivety, I had both my apple devices linked through iCloud and completely forgot to go through my long neglected iPad and delete some *ahem* indecent content. 

Immediately, my dad drops his composure, screaming “oh my GOD” several times while my mom attempts to placate this affair. Because, uh, how do you even BEGIN to comprehend that??? They never talked about it again. Up until this point, they were both sworn to secrecy (with the exception of my fuckwad brother who never told me). 

And I am just finding this out, a mere 3 days before my birthday. So happy birthday to me. I am forever convinced I am part of a sick sitcom and will now live with two life long lessons:

1. don’t film yourself doinking you idiot
2. for the love of GOD go through your iCloud settings

2022-07-12 00:37:12,5,True,1,"For some additional context, we’ve had sex 2 times so far, neither of us finished but we both had a good time both times she just said she wanted to wait a bit before trying again. We were both virgins and losing her virginity was always a really special thing to her and she didn’t want to have sex right away

We had sex for the first time about three months ago and it went well mostly but her mom came home while we were doing it and she didn’t want to keep going with her home. The other thing was that it really hurt for her at first and she was comfortable but tense. I held her hand and comforted her as much as I could while we did it. She was in the mood and was quite wet but for some reason it hurt and I think she was just tense and it made it hurt for her. 

The next time I really tried to make sure she was comfortable and I reassured her that if she wanted to she could stop at any time. I told her to tell me if anything felt bad or good so we could both have a good time. It was ok at first but she felt physically uncomfortable during it and asked me to stop which I did. She felt bad but I hugged her and reassured her it was ok and told her we don’t have to do anything and she can go at her own pace

After that she said she wanted to wait a bit to do it again until she was ready which is where we are now. Last time we were together she asked me if we could do it and told me she was ready but I told her I didn’t have a condom and that we could wait a bit until I did. She has plan b but I think we’d both be more comfortable with a condom and I don’t want to risk anything

She told me she was ready to do it next time and that she wants to try. I made sure she doesn’t feel pressured and she told me she wasn’t and told me that she’d say if she was in the mood next time. I want to do the same things I did the first couple of times but I was wondering if there was anything I could/should do different because I really want us both to have a good time and experience this time. We’re both new to this so I was wondering if there is anything I should do to make her more comfortable physically and mentally and to make sure she’s ok",relationship_advice,"Me and my girlfriend are about to have sex for the first time in a while, is there anything I can do to make it better for both of us?",3.0,2022-07-12
2022-07-12 00:48:53,2,True,1,"TL, DR: I met a guy from out of town, we fell in love and decided to try a LDR. while he seems happy, I am struggling to match the intensity of his feelings for someone who is not there. I don't know what to do to best keep his feeling safe.

In late march, I (22m) met a guy (28) at a party, where he said he was visiting from out of town. He was really cute, and we kept running into each other throughout the night. The next day, he asked me to go on a date with him before he left town. We hit it off, and there was an instant connection. We had a wonderful night. We agreed to keep in touch, and so we did. 

fast forward a month of talking pretty often, and he says he would like to come visit me. I tell him that i am okay with it, but i make it clear that i am not looking for a long distance relationship, or really anything at all. I would be happy to see him casually. He totally agreed, and said that he just ""enjoyed my energy"". 

So then he visits, and its honestly an amazing time. he brought some HIGHLY special and personalized gifts for my birthday, Which was surprising and amazing. in the three days we spent together, we did so much and honestly just kindled a wonderful connection. by the end, we had fully fallen for eachother, and decided to try to make it work. i cried all the way back from the airport after dropping him off.

The first month that after went pretty well, we talked almost daily, I was very sure of my feeling and what i wanted, we even started talking about what we wanted in the future. it was clear the we both liked eachother and perhapes wanted a long term commitment. But nowadays I am struggling.

I am a very physical, intimate and loving guy, with physical touch being my primary love language. Im not good with my words, But i could cuddle for hours. I also dont like texting or being on my phone much.  So the predicament has started where I feel overwhelmed texting and talking to him. like i like hanging out with him online casually, but hes the type to be on his phone ALOT. He always texts first, he will text me mutiple times over the course of the day but i rarely return them just cause i am so exhausted with work. I feel bad cause i can tell how much he cars for me,and how much i mean to him, but i just feel unable to reciprocate that energy for someone who isnt there with me. especially since the basis of our relationship feels like i have to to be on a phone the whole day to interact with him.

Also, For context, I am a polyamorous guy, and i made that clear to him at the start of our relationship. I am fine to hook up with other people, and the same goes for him (we often talk about out encounters together). i also made it clear that I may get into other relationships and may have other partners. He had been in throuples before, and said he was alright with that as well (though, i dont know if he could handle the possibility he might not end up being my ""primary"" partner). Again, The same goes for him, and i have no issues with that. So its not that i am totally unsatisfied in that aspect, as i can be physically and sexually fulfilled outside of our relationship. 

I think the meat of the problem is that, Even though i do love my boyfriend, Because of the context of being in an LDR, I dont feel that I get as much from our relationship since we arent physically together, especially at the level of commitment i feel he wants. like, if we were to ever move to the same city, that would not be a possibility for 2+ years. And it sucks, cause if we lived in the same place, there wouldnt even be an issue. he is a wonderful person, And I admire that he has an established life in his own city. But I want a partner that already lives in that same place as me.

I dont want to cut contact, and I reeeaaaally dont want to break up at all. I love spending time with him when we do. But I also dont think I can keep up the level of emotion he desires, or be the kind of partner he wants long term. I would happily talk with him often, Hell, I would still buy plane tickets to see him, but theres not good way to say that you want to ""tone down"" your relationship with someone.

I am married to a foreign national (28m) American to be exact and i am Filipino (25f). 
He went here last march 2022 and came back to USA April 2022. And from then he became a mad man. We are in a long distance relationship for now. I tried my best to understand him. He's always mad about simple things. Like ATTENTION, From morning  i wake up we are already in a call. Tbh even tho i am sleeping we're always in a call. He's the first person i always talk to everyone morning until afternoon my time (his sleeping time because of different time zones) and i only have usually 6-8 hours to do all the chores. I have to do all the chores manually. I have a son (6yrM) and ofc i have responsibilities with him. When we are watching movies together and i asked him to pause it to check the rice or adobo (Filipino dish) he always got upset and irritated and started to complain about it. That i am ruining things i am annoying something like that  one time he said i am the most annoying girl he met. 

About UPDATE...
I always tried my best to update him. Even tho it's really difficult to multitask i always tried my best to update him. Like when i brought my son to school. I was holding umbrella, folder, wallet and my son's hand since we're walking in the side of the road. I can't text that much because i am holding my son's hand and my wallet in my left hand and umbrella in my right hand but I still tried my best to text him. And still he said i was neglected him  i was ignoring him. Which in my knowledge i didn't because i tried my best to update and text him. I explained the situation also but he didn't listen to me  

DISRESPECT.... 
He called me wh*re, b*tch and other insults. He called my son future r*pist just because my son can't sleep alone in his room and want to sleep in my room (in the Philippines it is completely normal) i explained to him what happened and he called him that. He c*rsed at me all the time. He yelled at me all the time. He always said that i fucked other guys because i went to the store, school and church. He told me not to go to the church anymore (i am Christian)  whenever i go to church he always got mad. He wants me to text him all the time which is i always do. I am listening to the pastor while texting him and for him i am neglecting him when i didn't respond for 2 minutes. He wants me to respect him but i am begging for the respect i deserve. Whenever we have an argument he's always calling me b*tch and c*nt and m*ther f*cker all worse name you know. It hurts me a lot. But he didn't care about my feelings. 

INTIMACY.....
I admit we don't have better s*x life. Aside from we are far i am not a fan of m*st*rbation tbh. I tried m*sturbation for the first time because of him to satisfy him. I sent n*des to my exes but just t*ts and with bra. Two exes only. And for him i did the thing i don't like. Touching or playing myself because i know he likes it. I stopped doing it because of the pains he gave to me. Insults, i never feel heard, loved and valued. He always got mad everytime i rejected him  and when my son is around because we don't have privacy and then when he's mad he insulted me again. He said he will watch p*rn because i am useless. 
These past few days we always have arguments. I badly wanna have deep talk with him about our problems because i love him and i want my marriage to be saved. I want us to last. But he always ignore me. He told me he loves me but i said you love me because you're h*rny and hate me when you're not.  That's what i always feel. He always started an argument with me and everytime he's hard or h*rny he's nice to me. He's sweet. But when he's not hard he hates me so much. I am crying while typing this because it hurts me a lot. I can't feel his love anymore. He told to my friends that he fucked me good. That should be my privacy. He said ""F*CK YOU"" to my friends even tho they're not talking to him. I texted his mom to tell this but he got mad at me. Nothing happened. He didn't listen to his mom.

He is the one supporting me financially. He always counting everything he gave but i really do appreciate it. I never asked for money. These is all his idea. He doesn't want me to work. But whenever i need to go to the hospital he always care about money but i understand that because it's another expense but my point is at least show me that he's worried about me. Not to argue with me about money. I never asked money from him even tho it's for hospital bills. 

Idk what to do. I tried my best to explain my feelings but he never listen to me. He never pay attention. He wants me to respect him but he never respect me  and I still respecting him. I always obey him. But i am draining. I feel depressed. Please give me an advice to save my marriage or things I should do. Please.

I didn’t know we’d be home alone until we got there, and it scared me a bit, but I figured it was just anxiety. We were sitting on his couch, watching Friday the 13th, and he invited me to go in his room. I went up with him, and we made out for a bit. Things started going further, and I realized I didn’t wanna do it. I told him no, but he didn’t listen. He was stronger than me, and he raped me. He took my virginity. I felt so dirty and disgusting. After he was done, he made me walk home, and I walked home trembling and sobbing and considered just jumping in front of a car. I remember absolutely everything that happened. His radio was on playing kryptonite by three doors down, he smacked me across the face, he tore my shirt, he told me he was disappointed in how I acted.

After I got home, I took a 48 minute long shower. I scrubbed everything so many times. The inside of my legs were scrubbed raw. I scrubbed the blood of my hymen breaking, I scrubbed the disgusting seed he left in me. Thank god I am on birth control for my periods. I have taken 8 pregnancy tests and thankfully they have all been negative. 

I went into a numb state for 2 weeks. I barely ate, I barely drank, I don’t even remember the conversations I had. My friends didn’t even notice me acting different, and to be honest, they probably didn’t even care. I didn’t have anyone to reach out to them, and I don’t have anyone to reach out to now. I can’t talk to anyone in my family. I still enter that state sometimes. I haven’t fully processed any of it.

I still feel like it’s my fault this happened. If i just didn’t go over, if I wasn’t so stupid, if I decided to think for even one second about anything going on. I can’t think about sex now without wanting to throw up. I still feel disgusting and awful. I struggle with suicidal thoughts daily. I just needed to post this somewhere.

This is going to be long and I’m so sorry. It’s a wild ride.

I don’t even know where to start. My brother had a girlfriend, they dated for 8 years. One day they met a young 18 year old at the mall, my brother was 25, his girlfriend was as well. (This was 2 years ago.) my brother and his girlfriend still lived with my mom, so they invited the 18 year old to live with them as well because she rebelled, moved out, etc.. I started noticing the 18 year old, let’s call her Briana, in my brothers room slot without his girlfriend. I confronted the girlfriend but she didn’t seem to mind so I left it at that. 

My mom had a boyfriend who also lived with them. My mom went to the store one day and when she got back, she caught Briana and her boyfriend in their room, shirtless, with the boyfriend giving her a massage. She would’ve been 19-20 by then. My mother kicked her boyfriend out, BUT NOT BRIANA. she didn’t want to hurt my brother. He has always been my moms favorite- my mom raised him and my dad raised me up until he passed away. My brothers girlfriend of 8 years ended up leaving him, and now Briana and my brother are in a relationship. 2 months later they ended up getting married. I’ve always had a problem with her, she’s arrogant, manipulative, treats my mom like shit even though she lets her live in her house. 

So just this weekend they wanted to come visit me because I live a few hours away. They ended up bringing another girl with them. She is again, 18 and seems like she has her whole world ahead of her. I caught them all holding hands together, he would sneak out and kiss the 18 year old, Briana didn’t seem to mind because they were sitting on my couch all holding hands. 

I wanted to tell her so badly that she’s to young for this, and should not get caught up with my brother and his wife who make absolutely no effort to better themselves. They both work part time, still live with my mom, hardly pay bills, and now are 27 and 22. She was saying she had anxiety, depression, adhd etc.. and it worries me that they are trapping her. I was stupid as shit at 18, I just feel like she will mess up her life if she continues with my train wreck of a family.  Not to mention they are Mormon, AND I KNOW THEY DONT BELIEVE IN MULTIPLE WIVES, but damn they make it hard for people to really believe that. My brother just seems to have fallen off the deep end in life, which I don’t know where it went wrong because our parents always busted their ass for us even if they were separated.",relationship_advice,Do I watch from the sidelines or try and warn?,1.5,2022-08-30

I wasn’t going to make this into a throwaway account, but my husband and best friend convinced me, so here we are. 

This particular FU happened back in Feb 2020, I was trying to think up something fun and romantic for Valentine’s Day. My husband and I have a great sex life, even with young kids, but I’ve never had great game in the BJ department. I’m happy enough to go down there, but I’ve never let him finish in my mouth. Once a friend described swallowing as akin to “swallowing snot” and I’ve never gotten that image out of my head. So I decided, this was the year. I was going to man up and swallow the gravy. After a few painful (incognito) Google searches on “how to swallow semen” that yielded disappointing results, I finally figured it out. I had the perfect solution, I was going to give him road head! That way, I HAD to swallow, because I had no other option. I told him about my plan, and we agreed that this was definitely the best way. 

The big night came, my mom got to our house to watch the kids. I had three twisted teas and a handful of my kid’s leftover goldfish to settle my nerves. I had outfitted our van into an oral shaggin’ wagon, complete with flavoured lube and a towel. I was ready. He was going to get the best blow j of his life. We head down a dark country road and I get started. I bust out every trick that I had read about in Cosmo in my 20’s. I feel like an empowered sex goddess, that is, until he grabbed my hair and moaned that he was about to come. At that moment, I panicked and tried to pull back, but it was too late. As he came, I promptly threw everything up into his lap, then burst into tears. 

Bless his sweet heart, he didn’t even *realize* at first. He kept saying ‘don’t apologize baby, that was amazing. It feels so warm..so amazing.” Then, with some creeping concern, “Wait. Why is it chunky? Why do I feel chunks? Did… did you THROW UP on me??” 

At this point we both start laughing uncontrollably on the side of the road while he mopped up his crotch with a towel. We then realized that he couldn’t very well go to dinner without pants, so we drove back to the house. I then had to sneak into my own home, past my mother and children, to get my husband puke-free pants for our date. 

We decided that we weren’t hungry anymore and spent the rest of our date night blinking at each other over our starbucks wondering what the hell just happened.

          I don’t know where else to put this so I’m going to put it here. I think my step father has been secretly videoing me taking a shower. Reason why I say think because I was told to clean up the bathroom and the soaps , etc while in there and I found a camera. I checked the camera and it had footage of my mother bathing but it was in an inconspicuous box so you wouldn’t have thought to look at it but have thought it apart of the bathroom. The camera was not recording, so I thought he just wanted to video my mother showering and it was their ‘kink’. So I did not bring it to anybody’s attention. Reason why I was suspicious was because every time I wanted to bathe he’d say let him use the bathroom first and I just attributed it to him having a weak bladder as that was what he normally does.

Today I wanted to bathe and he asked to let him go in the bathroom first. Mind you, I was not thinking about before findings so I was like eh okay. I bathed and everything and I had to clean where the soaps were again. Lo and behold was a box. I looked and saw the camera.  I pulled it out of the box and realized it was still recording. I looked through the video and I saw him setting the camera, me showering and when I went to fix the soaps. Phone was on silent, anything to make a notification come up was off.  I edited the video so that me taking up the camera was cut and hopefully he attributes it to the camera shutting off.

I don’t know how to feel as he has been with my mom for years and I see him as a father figure and he never gave me any indication that he had a those tendencies. Furthermore my mom even quit her job as certain things prevented her continuing working there. I have 4 siblings and we’re all dependent on him and his family.

2022-09-04 00:05:52,14,True,14,"Okay before I get into this I’d just like to say this is not one of my finer moments. Anyways, it was the middle of the afternoon and my family was wanting to go out to eat Mexican food for dinner. While I (18M), wasn’t feeling it because a: I was tired, b; I wanted some alone time, and c; I wanted a specific type of alone time. Long story short, my family tried and failed to get me to join them and they left. 
As soon as they left I hopped straight on my laptop and decided to work on prepping some mods for my friends and my’s realm in Minecraft that we’re starting later tonight. Well, some time passed and some more, and after picking out several good looking mods (yes we’re playing bedrock edition don’t judge us), I decided it was time to engage in my other type of “alone time.” Well I’m not gonna go into detail for obvious reasons, but let’s just say I was petting the snake for a decent amount of time while sitting on a bench just right of the hall way to my room and left of the dining room. It was going great, and I was almost done when I thought I heard a car door slam, so I looked outside really quick, didn’t see the car my family took, and then decided to go back at it. Well obviously I didn’t look hard enough because just as I finished I heard the side door open and my family start to walk in. Panicking, I reached to grab my lube and dart into my room butt-ass naked and did until I got there and realized it was a sweater, so I hurried back to the bench and snatched the lube and went to my room again, sadly leaving my mom, dad, and brother to notice me running off naked while my clothes were left on the floor. I wish the story ended there, but, my family having easily deciphered what I had done, started singing some shit along the lines of “playing with my ding-a-ling” until I locked myself in the bathroom. With nothing else to do, I just started blasting “Heat of the Moment” by Asia well I got in the shower knowing my brother had probably already told our groupchat everything. Oh well, as embarrassing as it was, I’d rather get caught jerking off then have to explain why there was lube in the dining room.

2022-10-16 18:30:30,8,True,1,"I never intended or wanted to look for it. But I have viewed art of fictional underaged characters in erotic situations (drawn porn). I tend to assume that if I don't recognize the characters being drawn, they are adults (unless they expressly look like children or teens). 

But I have even masturbated to underaged characters, not realizing that they were underaged until I looked them up afterward. 

And then today, something really disturbing happened. I suddenly remembered a particular image of an anime character I already believed was underaged, yet my brain and body kept getting aroused thinking about the image. I looked it up to figure out her age for sure (she was 13) and to try to dissuade myself by seeing plainly why it was gross, but that was obviously a horrible decision. I kept looking at it in anxiety and maybe disgusting intrigue. 

Was I becoming aroused just because of the actions and feelings the image depicted (I tend to put myself in the place of the characters, most of the time)? Did my mind suddenly disconnect from my moral thoughts and decide it liked the ""forbiddenness?"" But that doesn't make sense, the minute I remind myself of her age, I shudder in horror and disgust again. I actively fear and worry for children's safety, I become paralyzed by stories of child abuse... so why was this happening? It's never happened before. I feel like I'm going insane.

Why do people draw such art? Why can't they just draw adults only? I never know that what I'm looking at is actually safe. I'm paranoid now. God, I hate porn. Yet, I keep going back to it. Everytime. I convince myself I won't find triggering things *this time.* Yeah, right.

But today, I looked up the legality of these mistakes, only to find that even just *viewing* fictional minors in sexual situations is incredibly illegal. It's a federal crime in the US. Look it up if you don't believe me. 

I never intentionally looked for these things, they just pop up, and I never downloaded any of that art. Honestly, when I look at porn, I usually just scroll through whatever appears on google image search (porn sites terrify me). I mean, I do click onto things like Tumblr and Twitter and other such sites from Google images/ search... Ahhhh, what is wrong with me? It's so, so disturbing. And now... I'm a criminal, aren't? They're all fictional characters, I fucking hate it with all my guts, but I've committed a serious crime, haven't I? One they could jail me for, a condemnatory offence. They could come after me, destroy me, and I deserve it, I deserve to die... I've made the mistake over and over again, and I'll keep making the mistake over and over again...

From a very young age, I’ve had practically unrestricted access to the internet; meaning before my prepubescent years, I’ve practically been exposed to +18 material/softcore pornography.

I’d fantasise in class, would sketch out inappropriate material in my workbooks &amp; later on in my teen yrs began to act out on these impulses and slept with a few people, including one of my best friends as an experiment type thing.

Basically I broke up with my boyfriend because I believed that our relationship wasn’t going anywhere since he barely had time to do anything with me and was always busy, still we had a lot of sexual encounters almost every time we where together which was 2 o 3 times a month (to me that’s barely time to make our relationship work if we are speaking about long term) so I broke up with him because I wasn’t happy with how our relationship was going. Even though I talked to him about it, it just seemed like he brushed it off like It wasn’t that serious and I became very sad because of it so I decided that it was better to part ways.

Now after weeks of begging me to come back with him I wasn’t sure but I decided to give him another chance to do better as a partner. Now I wanted to start fresh because I wasn’t sure about him yet and I told him that I wasn’t ready to have sex with him and he said he understood that. Somehow he always brings this topic about sex and asking stuff like “when will I be ready” and all I can say is “ when I feel sure about us is when I’ll probably be ready to have sex again” and he says he understands. Now yesterday he sends me a message like this “I know you are not ready to have sex yet, but our relationship is 40% based on sex and you can’t deny that”. So I just wanna know if I’m wrong to believe that he is wrong for saying something like that to me specifically because we just started back together like a month ago and still barely see each other( this month about 2 times) and because he is speaking from our past relationship.

After losing 400 dollars to the promises of sex (it was a couple of scams that promised 3 hrs for 200 dollars but in the form of eBay gift cards. I still keep those cards drained gift cards as a reminder to never do that again.) I found an Asian masseuse 45 minutes away from my house on one those websites and decided to try that.

When I got there, I wasn't sure I was at the right place. The parlor was decorated with thick, dark blue curtains on the doors and windows and when I walked in, it was cozily lit with a gray loveseat for seating and a waterfall that was plugged in to the wall to add ambience to the space.

I sat on the loveseat after grabbing a lifesaver breath mint from the counter and waited for a couple minutes. The lady that brought me to the back was a 4'10"" Vietnamese woman in her 40s wearing a bedazzled blue dress that hung just low enough to where you would see her nipples. She escorted me into a room with the number ""2"" on it hanging on by a single nail and told me to undress.

While undressing, I was left with a sense of both confusion and acceptance. I should've guessed it wasn't all it was cracked out to be. The add said the masseuse was a busty E cup Asian in her 20s. However, what I got was a small tittied woman in her 40s. However, desperate after my break up, I went through with it anyways.

I only had around 100 bucks on me at the time. She and I had talked and negotiated that we did 50 for a hand job. I layed on my back while she oiled her hands. She did allow me to touch her. She started to stroke my penis, it wasn't having it. All of the things leading up to this point made me lose the drive I had coming in to it. She didn't finish me off, and I was left sad and upset. But hey, at least she let me touch her.

After I paid for the service, I left with a bad taste in my mouth. Maybe it was from the Lifesaver mint that I had earlier, but I was doubtful. I was cheated out of 50 bucks. I know I at least got something from it, however, expectations weren't met. Of course, why would they be if I found an add on a sketchy hookup website filled with scammed.

in the 5th grade during a weekend around the middle of the year i(F10-11) had a sleepover with max/my step sister(F13-14), ally(F13-14), and sid(F10-11). max and ally had an off and on relationship and during oner of their 24 hour breaks sid asked max to be fwb and since max 
1. wanted to get ally jealous 
2. didn't actually plan to do anything with her 
said sure to sid and that lasted less than 12 hours. but since sid was already coming over and max felt a little uncomfortable being alone after that got ally to spend the night as well.

around 7pm sid pulled me over in private and started crying and talking about how lonely she was and how she was going to off herself if nobody got with her within the next few hours. and she kept hinting that.she wanted that person to be me and i asked her was fwb meant (cuz i didn't fully know at the time) and she told me it was friends who cuddled and slept in the same bed together so i thought ""oh i've had multiple fwb then it'll be the same way and she'll feel better"" so i agreed to it and she was all happy again. 

 during that night max and ally slept in the same bed then in the bed next to them is where sid and i were going to sleep. but neither of us were tired yet so we stayed up watching a gameplay of sally face. then she scooted closer to me and i didn't think much of it. but then as she got closer she asked if i wanted to watch the video on my back and i said sure. but then when i rolled over she then sat on top of me and held my wrists and told me to be quiet. i won't go into detail of what further happened. 

 but after stuff happened and it was morning i tried to pretend like nothing happened and that everything was okay. i know i should've said something then but i didn't fully know what to do about it. and i was already used to similar things at school so i thought it was normal. once i hit around the middle of 6th grade i realized that what happened during my 5th-6th grade years weren't okay and i wish i would've known that they should've all stopped after i said no or that i shouldn't have listened to their empty threats.

I’m a student and she was older than me and more established but I felt like she verbally abused me. In the past I’ve always been pro relationship but lately I’ve been enjoying having fwb. The only issue is that it’s not really what I want long term. I honestly don’t want to open up because of my last breakup but I don’t want to use that as an excuse. 

There’s 3 things I’ve learnt:
1. Its important to be honest with yourself and what you want so you don’t waste people’s time.
2. You can’t force a relationship or a connection for that matter. 
3. It’s better to focus on how you can be the right man rather than looking for the right girl.

I know healing takes time but I was hoping to hear a little from both sides. I don’t want to be regarded as a “f*ck boy” because I have a lot of sexual experience but I’m also not willing to put in the effort that comes with a relationship especially while I’m in school and have a whole career to build.

2022-01-02 07:53:20,14,True,9,"This week I f*cked up to be exact.

I have been cleaning my anus area after number 2 by using water my whole life, that is the way I've been taught to do since I was a child. However as life progress I came to learn other ways to clean that area.

Around 2 months ago I have started using both toilet paper and water to ensure full cleanliness of my anus. I have insecurities over my toilet behavior and I believe others here as well. Also I usually do my number 2 in my office toilet (that contributes even more to my insecurity). 

The f*ck up began when I don't feel it's enough to just clean my anus with both toilet paper and water. I need it to be as clean as possible so I then started to put pieces of toilet paper (usually, two section of two ply folded over) and slip it in my ass after I'm done cleaning it.

Usually I have it in for 1-2 hrs and go to the toilet to take it out, but last week I had an unusually busy day that I delayed to take the pieces out not untill 5-6 hours after. I do feel slight irritation at the time but I sleep it off that night thinking it will go away. 

Fast forward to 2 days after, I woke up feeling uneasy in my anus area, I then try feeling it with my hand to see if anything stuck there and there it is, I could feel a lump exactly at the point of exit, it hurt like a MF, and as what millennials would do I Google the symptoms and to my not much of a shock, I have a hemorrhoids. 

Maybe for westerners your anus skin is slightly strong as you've been using toilet paper your whole life, but as a person who are just into the game mine is very sensitive. Now I'm typing this on my bed thinking of taking a shower but I don't want to move. It hurts when I'm walking.

But that statement kind of caught me off guard, but he said he wasn’t open to elaborate and I understood. But the next day I couldn’t stop thinking about it, he had been so vague. I wanted to know what he meant, so I brought it up again. He told me that it’s a thing that would require a lot of trust to tell me. I responded by saying “I understand and I don’t want to pry it out of you, but you were so vague that it leaves a lot of gaps. My mind fills in those gaps, it’s just been stressing me out” and i could tell he could tell that it was bothering. He opened up a little bit and told me that he knows it’s disgusting and wrong, but he looks at kids the wrong way sometimes.

He praises how well I’m doing and asks me to guide him and show him how to please me, I do, and he tries to ""last"" till I’m satisfied too, but I end up faking it so we could move on.

I feel horrible about this, for now he doesn’t seem to doubt anything, I know it would hurt him and make him doubt himself if he knew.


It’s not like I don’t feel physically attracted to him, I do. But when it’s time for action, even if I was exited for it, everything goes away.

2022-04-17 18:02:52,3,True,2,"So, long post, brace yourselfs. 

Back in 2018 I met this girl at a college party, we hooked up and went to my place. We were **very** drunk and had sex. 

So, the next few days I feel very overwhelmed by her, She didn't give me any space and I felt like we were dating, eventough we knew each other for 4-5 days. As I didn't want that, we barely knew each other, I ""broke"" things off (I don't think that there were anything to be broken, but anyways)

So for the next 1 and a half months she keeps on insisting that we should be together, says bad things about me to my friends, that I had a ""limp dick"" (I couldn't stay hard the first and only time we had sex, since we were so fucking drunk) etc. It was a nightmare and I felt guilty for not wanting to be with her.

One day she messages me and says we need to talk and tells me she is pregnant. I couldn't believe it at first, since we wore a condom and I couldn't finish, but anyways, I don't remember much about that day. We started looking on how to abort since it is illegal where we live. 

The first time we tried it, it did not work, so we had to do it again, and then it worked. Neddless to say it was a pretty traumatic experience for both of us but specially for her obviously. We had to go to a lot of doctor appointments to see if everything was okay but many of them were assholes due to the stigma on abortion. 

We figure it out, she is physically okay but mentally a wreck. The same problems on she insisting that we should hook up keep on happening, they never really went away, but I looked over it at the time since there was a lot going on our head, even though the abortion went well the hardest part is dealing with it later, in our experience. We tried finding a terapist that she liked, but she never really liked the ideia and delt with it in her own ways. 

I will never understand how hard it was on her, because I'm not a woman, and so until this day, beacuse of all that's happened, I try not to be rude with her when she comes up with the subject of us having sex (just for fun she says, but  It is pretty clear she still has feelings for me).

 BUT I HAVE HAD ENOUGH. I really don't know how to deal with her. She has sexually assaulted me on a party by rubbing her hand on my private parts, psycollogically threatened me, keeps on sending me weird messages with weird songs saying how they remind her of me, is constantly trying to find out if Iam dating someone, It is a nightmare, I'm very traumatized by everything that happened, I tried to do my part as best as I could, even tough I was an asshole too during everything that happened, but this is definetely not my responsability in everything tht happened to us due to the abortion.

She is constantly reminding me of ""us"", saying how people ask her a lot about me (she probably talks a lot about me to her friends, as If there were anything between us).

I feel stalked, creepied, can't date anybody else because I fear on what she will do If I go out with somebody else (we hooked u twice only, tha last time on may 2018 I guess). I feel like I'm wasting my love life, I cant stand It,  I feel depressed and afraid of her, thinking about it triggers me a lot. 

The thing is I can't really avoid her since we go to the same college, and we are getting the same deegre. I tried telling her no multiple times, but I have been physically assaulted as well. 

I don't know what to do, It is just fucking sad and overwhelming, and I hate that this is happening.

2022-04-25 02:56:49,32,True,8,"My boyfriend (28M) and I (19F) started dating early this year and he pursued me for a relationship pretty fast. The first few weeks of dating were amazing, he’s everything I wanted and I adore him but it all took a super dark turn. He developed a back injury that was most likely a continuation of a bad car accident he was in a few months previous and was unable to work. 

There was a lot of up and down and aggression but he assured me he loved me, it was temporary, and due to the frustration of his injury and would just be until he could find work again. It’s been about a month and a half and I was under the impression I was lending him money (about $300 a week) for food and rent, and then around $100 in Ubers for him to come stay at my place. (I only recently started a management job which I’m proud of but I didn’t have much savings). I’ve very quickly gone back to living week to week off my whole paycheque, most of it being “leant” to him. If I couldn’t or when I’d get short on money there was often frustration from him and mention of him leaving to fly home and end the relationship.
He says also due to his injury and frustration surrounding it his mental health has declined and has developed serious jealousy issues and almost made me quit my job (the one supporting him) because it made him uncomfortable that I work with males around my age. I was super understanding the whole time and would always talk him through things and he would be super grateful for it. 

After we finally started to see the light, his back was getting better, he has a job lined up, and seemed to have overcome the jealousy and lashing out at me, last night it took a super dark turn. (I was aware he used drugs and assumed these were favours from friends or I would give him extra money to get some for his pain)
Instead of using the money I was giving him for rent, he had been using it to pay off an astronomical debt he had with two dealers (nothing scary, he just didn’t want to ruin the friendship he had with both of them) both of them being over $1000, while getting more off them, going further into debt as the weeks went by. His roommate had been covering his rent so he could do this so even more money owed.

He says since I live with my parents and I’m the sole reason he remains in the city I should be able to help him and gets quite defensive and angry when I seemed unsure and massively he’s I stayed when he asked me to lend money and go into debt through my bank and loan websites. 

If there’s more I don’t know about and I can’t help even after I loan the money, I know I’ll be left here in debt heartbroken.
I feel like I’m being taken advantage of but can’t express this to him without it blowing up massively. 
I really love him and I do think he loves me but this situation makes me so stressed.

He’s mentioned his struggle with suicidal thoughts in the past and how he feels I’ve helped him out of these dark places and doesn’t know what he’d do without me. If I even think about leaving I feel an immense guilt for leaving him after being his sole support system mentally and financially. 
He assured me we were almost at the end of our struggle until this came up last night.

I feel the joy leaving my life but I feel stuck and I don’t stand up for myself and I don’t know what to do, I don’t have anyone else to talk to because I feel so ashamed and delusional for letting it get this far and im lost. 
I know I don’t want to go into debt but im feeling a lot of pressure too, if I don’t he’ll go home and it’ll have been all for nothing and I need serious advice. 
I know I’m in the wrong for being so weak and passive for enabling this but I need help. Thanks",relationship_advice,My older boyfriend relies on me for money and I don’t know how to resurface from this.,20.0,2022-04-25

She said kind of yes  so then I asked her does it hurt to much do you wanna stop? She said sure so then we got dressed and cuddled for an hour we hung out twice since went to dinner once but have smoked each time and cuddled for at least an hour each time in the backseat I just don’t know what direction to take this with her she’s pretty shy and new sexually so doesn’t know what she likes and I’ve never been with someone so new sexually.

But an hour after I got home I was surprised to hear she wanted to go out again later that night. I brought up going to a strip club only because we joked about going to one during the date, but she was down with it. So we meet up and go a little after the place opened, and god DAMN I immediately see a 10/10 cutie on the pole. We sat down at the bar and made eye contact, and she took her titties out, and she was as stacked as she is gorgeous. We kind of just sat around, got drinks and watched some dances for about 20 minutes, until my date suggested we leave and makeout in the car for a while. Anyway, we did that for a while before going back to my place, but I still had my card inside and had to go get it. I saw the stripper I fancied sitting at the bar, so I struck a quick conversation and mentioned she made us horny enough to make out in the car for a while. She told me her (probably stage) name and I ended up just grabbing my card and leaving. I guess the main problem is, I wasn't fully attracted to my date, and I was just seeing where things would go. and now three days later, I'm still thinking about that girl and considering going back this weekend alone just to see her... I'm sure people who are more familiar with strip clubs will find this kinda cringe to read, but this was also my first time going to one. I guess moral of the story, dont go on a strip club date unless the two of you are fully committed to each other, otherwise somebody might be as dumb as me...

2022-05-21 05:02:51,1,True,1,"A few days ago, I (F18) went on a walk at my local park. This guy (M18) came up to me and wanted to get to know me. We exchanged socials, I showed him my insta from my phone and he took my phone searched his name then requested me on his profile. I don’t know really know anyone in this neighborhood so I was pretty happy because I’ve always wanted a friend or someone I could talk to within the neighborhood. We walked around the park while he’s walking his dog. We get to know each other, we’re about the same age, he’s a pretty well off kid, good grades, athletic and off to a really good college. He shocked me a bit during the conversation because of his mentions of using alcohol and smoking. (We’re both 18, I was born really late in the year so I’m only a few months older.). But I really don’t mind his use of those substances. During our walk he mentions about going to parties, then later on asks if I ever hookup with people. Obviously, I say no. It’s just something I have NEVER take part in, but wouldn’t mind experimenting. He asked if I would ever hookup with him, I said no since he’s just in high-school even though he’s graduating in a week. “What’s the problem were both 18, so would you?” he asked. I kinda just quietly and hesitantly said “mmmh..nah..” because I’m very self conscious of my body. UGH! Coming to a full circle around the park, he asks which way I live of course we both show each other which way our house is (just not exact location). I could’ve gone the same way as him but while walking down the park (a short walk) it was so quiet ( I was just following by his side) so I took a different route and said bye, he was already walking about 3-4 ft away and didn’t see him even look back. I can’t tell if he’s offended that I said no to hooking up with him, couldn’t hear me, or probably thought I was also going the same way and just be beside following him since I pointed the same direction where he lives. I was too shy to ask further questions while walking with him at the park. As I got home, I waited about an hour if he would accept my request he had requested with my account. Still nothing yet, so I UNREQUESTED because after a long NOT so thoughtful decision I thought he’s really not suitable for me. But questions I wanted to ask, but was too shy to ask started flooding me. I have this desire for him to show me his world since he seems so be more on a wild side. So I don’t know… should I go to the park again the same time he walked his dog, then try to get to know him more, that is if we ever cross paths again. OR message him on instagram since he’s still on the search history and ask if we could meet again.

2022-05-25 16:06:26,3,True,4,"I've had suicidal thoughts for over a decade now, but apart from a couple of instances it's remained at the 'ideation' level. It's still extremely hard to deal with though, especially feeling like I can't reach out to friends or family with these feelings. I don't think there's a way to say ""I want to kill myself"" while also communicating that I'm not in danger right this second and whoever I'm talking to doesn't need to call an ambulance or haul me to an emergency room.

I'm incredibly burnt out with work (although I still don't work as many hours as some of my coworkers, which just makes me feel shitty in a whole other way). I've always dabbled in writing as a hobby: I recently sat down and tried to write something longer length - not even a serious story, literally just a silly fanfic - and realised I've somehow lost any talent I ever had. I'm exhausted, I feel like a failure at life, and now I'm afraid that the one thing I thought I had as a back-up skill has evaporated. It probably doesn't sound like much to some people but to me -- I'm just having an incredibly hard time and it's bringing the suicidal thoughts back. And I wish I could tell someone.

It feels... I don't know, manipulative I guess - as if I'm trying to commandeer attention without a genuine reason. Because the fact that I'm still here shows that nothing will happen if I don't reach out, so I don't actually need someone.

2022-05-25 16:10:00,24,True,0,"Hello all. My situation is complicated so bare with me. First of all, I am Poly and have two partners. My first partner (32M) live with, and we have been together two years. The man in question lives about an hour away from me, and we’ve been dating since February. Our relationship is more “casual” than that of my partner of two years simply because I can’t see him every day, but we still love eachother. To make it easier, I’ll call him Steve. 

When Steve and I first started talking (before we met in person) we were sexual almost every day. Sexts, videos, pictures, you name it. Then after meeting in real life, we’d have sex every time we meet. Usually that is every other weekend, and a day or two during the week. There was a point where I was seeing Steve more often than that, but he started getting visitation for his son. Anyway…For the last month or so, Steve doesn’t seem to be eager to have sex with me when we meet, and the times we do have sex, he lies about cumming. After a few times of this happening, I confronted him on it. Sex/physical touch is one of my love languages and is really important to me. More than that, I am very self conscious  (though he promises I’m the most attractive girl he’s ever been with) When confronted, there was a lot of avoidance on the topic. He basically said “It’s not that deep, I’m just getting old I guess” and kind of made me feel guilty for asking. I just was over at his house yesterday. I was finishing up my period and told him that I wanted to but didn’t know if it would be a good idea, and he took that as an exit to “get out” of sex. He rarely initiates anything over text anymore, and responds to any pictures I send pretty mildly. It just seems like the drive is gone and I don’t know why because he enjoyed it so much at first. 

One more thing I will note is that Steve is an alcoholic. Even if he isn’t straight up drunk he’s usually drinking some beer. So far I have a few theories as to why this is happening 1. He is drinking a lot of the time so he can’t get it up and is embarrassed 2. It really is his age and he has a lower libido than he used to when he was younger 3. He is bored by me because I give it to him so willingly so he’s not interested in sex. 

If it’s the third option I would have a lot of problems, but the first two are understandable. I don’t know what to make out of the situation because it seemed to change for no reason.

It was a message from an unsaved number and the message read something like "" you didn't show up at the spot, don't flake again"". In my head im like these spam messages are getting creative. I turn off his alarm and i'm about to pass him the phone and the same number texts again ""come on , what you want me to beg for that (insert tongue licking emoji)??"" , at this point i'm like am i seeing this or am i just that drunk.

2022-09-13 01:42:31,3,True,2,"for some context, im biologically female, though i came out as trans around 11-12. i dont really know what gender or pronouns i use currently, but at the time of the incident, i was using he/him and physically transitioning to male. i would have been 13 - 14, and im 18 currently. 

i dated alot as a kid/teen, so when J (M, 14 at the time) came along and started flirting with me, i took to him immedatley. he was big and strong, carried himself with ease, and extremly persuasive. this would have been at the very start of highschool. its important to note now that J was a cis gay male, and ran a yearly queer festival in our small city that gained quite the name for itself.

at first, i think i really did love him. or at least - that kind of child-like love you hold for your first crush. we were inseperable, all of our friends pushed our relationship on, and even teachers got in on it. near the end of grade 9, we shared almost every class, and were automatically paired together during any group assignment. i couldnt escape him if i wanted to. 

during the summer between grade 9 and 10, i had a massive breakdown. an incident at home made me crash completley. i vividly remember sitting in my room, sniffling and hiccuping as i sent a novel of a text to him explaining why i wasnt ready for this relationship, i couldnt take it anymore, and i needed space. he responded almost immedatley. ""so you have some commitment issues. so what? thats no reason to break us up for. you still have to make up for everything youve done."" i was extremly confused - i couldnt think of a single time i hurt him or would need to ""make up"" for something. i tried to argue back but got the same response, and when i went to my friends, i was ignored. by the time the summer was up and we were in grade 10, we were offical again, at my extreme reluctance.

i dont remember after that. nothing. my next memory is in grade 11, sitting in my room, watching my english teacher on zoom talk about critical theory. i have bits and pieces - a faint memory here, a sentence there, but thats it. my parents seemed to treat me the same, and i slowly caught back up with life, constantly confused and reluctant. my memories been extremly spoty since, and ive become accustomed to the feeling of brain fog and lethargy. i developed any eating disorder. i didnt sleep. 

i recently moved to a big city in my country to persue a university career. im thankful to be surrounded by people who love me, namely my best friend, C (also ftm 18). C has been my friend since we were kids, and we transitioned together. i love him dearly, and hes helped me alot during this, even if i havent told him the full story. because of an argument between us at the time, C wasnt around for when J and i were in a relationship, so he only knew that J was a bad guy and the relationsip ended messily. 

while browsing some promotional stuff for my school, i spotted a name that immedatley made me freeze. it was the name of the queer festival that J ran. i started shaking. i couldnt move - both out of shock at my own body's reaction, and at this deep, horrible gut feeling that made me want to throw up. every last cell in my body was screaming at me to get up, walk to the window, and jump out. through tears i texted C with links and screenshots, begging him to help me make sure that it wasnt J. after 20 minutes or so he completley confirmed it was just sheer coincidence, and that it couldnt be J in the slightest.

that night was maybe one of the worst nights of my life. i \*knew\* bad things happened during that year, but i thought it was normal. people dont tend to remember their childhood, why should i? what would make mine any different? everytime i closed my eyes, i saw his face in a light i didnt remember, and this disgusting, wet sound that made me want to tear my skin off. im hearing it now, while i write this, 4 years later and hundreds of kilometers away from him. i cant stop shaking. 

since then, its been hell. i try to forget about it and push it away, but no matter what i do, i cant seem to go back to that blissful ignorance i had just days before. maybe worse then that is the constant doubt - am i faking it? what if this is all just my brain playing tricks on me, slandering a name that didnt deserve to be slandered, what if im just being dramatic - i dont know. 

nobody knows. i told C that something horrible happened in that relationship, but nothing more.

im afraid that if go to a doctor or therapist about this, they'll tell me im lying, or riddicule me, or try to make me press charges on him. i have a university career to persue - my family are extremly poor and scraped all their money together for me to persue this oppertunity, and i cant waste it. i was doing so well too, i was eating healthy and sleeping well, i was being social again, i have friends who love me and text me every day. im sitting in my dorm room eating a dinner of stale crackers and trying not to fall apart.

We’ve only been married 5 months now but I feel like our whole relationship was a mistake. We met on an app i was trying to make friends.(i wasn’t looking for relationship) he added me, I added him back and we hung out. After the second day of us hanging out he asked me to be his gf and I said yes. I was 18 and he was 21. I lived with my parents and my mom was doing drugs getting high 24/7 so he was like an escape. After a couple months of being together he told me he had a baby with someone else, but he said he didn’t know she was pregnant til she gave birth and that they had random sex at a party. Me being young, dumb, and lonely I told him I didn’t mind.( I did tho) A few weeks after that I was on his phone taking pictures and I got curious and looked at his Snapchat memories. Big mistake on my part. I saw pictures of the ultrasound and of his baby mama. So he did know she was pregnant and he was dating her when it happened. Then I scroll a little more and find a video of him having sex with a totally different girl. That shattered my heart. So then I got more curious and went to his gallery and saw he had thousands of saved nudes, even recent ones. He was in the shower while this was happening. When he got out I asked him to take me home while balling my eyes out. He refused and kept asking what was wrong. I told him what I found and he just lied and lied trying to get out of it. He’s a terrible liar. I don’t remember why or what possessed me to but I forgave him. A month later we were sitting on his bed and I was on his phone again not even looking for anything when he got a text. It was from a girl. Long story short he was in a long distance relationship with her. So I handed him his phone and said I was leaving ( I drove there) he then grabbed my leg like a child and and begged me not to go. Mind you he weighs 200+ and I’m not the strongest so I couldn’t really go anywhere. Then after I kept trying to leave he raced and grabbed my car keys and wouldn’t give them to me. So I said I’d walk. Then he grabbed me yanked me around and wouldn’t let me leave. After about 10 minutes of this I grabbed a knife. I barley know this guy and he was trying to keep me there against my will. Somehow he got the knife away from me and he pressed it against his stomach. Then he said he’d kill himself if I left and he started crying. I didn’t know what to do so I played nice and kept asking him to put the knife down but he wouldn’t . We ended up wrestling with the knife but I eventually got it and threw it across the room. Things escalated and he ended up in his roommates room. At first I didn’t know what he was doing and I was about to make a run for it but I had forgotten that his roommate had guns. His roommate wasn’t there at the time . He picked up one of his roommates guns and said “If I can’t have you no one can.”  My heart stopped, I thought I was about to die. I knew I couldn’t out run a gun so I fell to the floor crying and begging him to stop. You would think after this I’d leave him but no. He ended up stoping because my dad called and I told him I’d call him when I got home. I would’ve ghosted him but he knew where I lived. When I got home I was so physically tired I forgot to call or put my phone on the charger. I woke up to a million text and calls of him saying he was going to jump off a bridge but he never did. I had a family trip planned the next week so I went and I was planning to break thing off with him when I got back. But with my luck I should’ve known, I was pregnant. I immediately knew I wasn’t going to keep it( this was 2021) but I didn’t have insurance or money for it and I was too scared to tell my parents so I ended up not getting an abortion. I stayed with him because I was having his baby. No other reason. I didn’t know what I was doing . I was still a child . He treated me like crap the whole pregnancy, watching p*rn when I told him how it made me feel, getting physical everytime we got into an argument. I was depressed the whole time. We got eloped right before I was due. Why? Because I didn’t want to have a baby alone. When I went into labor he wouldn’t even take me to the hospital until I said I was walking. When we got there he was on tiktok the whole time, so yes I was upset, scared, and in pain. After I gave birth I was laying in the recovery room and I looked at his phone while he was sleeping and he was texting some girl telling her he wished he was there with her and her baby instead. Literally. Saying he missed her and loved her. And no it wasn’t his first baby mama it was a different girl the lived in a whole different state. I wanted a divorce then and there. Ever since things have been different. We moved in with his mom and we can’t find jobs. All he does is play 2k. Day and night. He hardly ever helps with his daughter. I know he doesn’t love me. He claims he does but puts me down every chance he gets. I can’t even leave unless he comes with because he won’t let me, even just to go to the store. I have to force myself to have sex with him because if I don’t he gets aggressive. I recently had a miscarriage and he didn’t even help m in any way. All he did was play 2k and treat me like crap. I’m scared to leave him because I don’t know what I’m doing as a parent and I have no one to help me.

 I (16F) have been in a relationship with this guy (17M) for about two years (let's call him Dave, for privacy). We met on social media and since we found out that we lived only 20 minutes far away so we were able to see eachother 2/3 times at week, since we were both very busy with school.

When we were still together he came to my house while my parents were away, last year. We spent time in my bedroom, I turned my led red and try to color some drawings since we're both appassionated in drawing and art in general. All of a sudden he wants to do ""things"" but I wasn't in the mood so I said no (I've never said no to him before, that was the first time.)  and he didn't took it well. In short words he s.a. me.

At first I justified him because he insisted so much that I said ""okay, fine"" so I thought it was my fault for not being strong enough to say no. Dave kept doing that for a while, and in May I broke up with him (for different reasons). Now I am with a better person who truly respects me. 

It's been a month I have been going to a psychologist because I have an anxiety disorder and I talked to him about Dave and together we found out that what he did was Actually s.a.

LONG STORY, bare with me please.

Hello all, longtime lurker on this sub. I’ll jump right into this instead of blabbering. These events took place 2-3 years ago and it still fucks with my head to his day. 

Met my ex-gf in freshman year of college and immediately started dating (I was 18, she was 19). We met through her roommate and hit it off pretty fast. The only thing was, our sex drives were very different and this became apparent very quickly. I am a constantly hands all over, cuddling, very affectionate kind of guy. She was not like this. 

As time goes on things do not improve with our sex life. She only ever wants to blow me or give me a handjob but would simply deny me from giving her really any kind of sexual ac if it wasn’t dry humping or sucking her nipples. She simply put it off as she was “more of a giver than a receiver.” I tried to get to the bottom of this, as she had multiple romantic partners in the past. She recounted sexual experiences with past partners to me, and I recounted some of mine to her; I wanted sex to be an open line of communication. (I don’t want to make it sound like all I thought about was sex, as she presented herself as a very sexual person upon meeting her; blowing me the second night we knew each other, her initiating) I had some serious conversations about this with her, trying to understand why when it came to me she wouldn’t. Asking if she’s had any kind of traumatic experience with sex in the past or anything of the sort, genuinely trying my hardest to empathize with her. Nothing. No trauma, no nothing. 

More time goes on and things get worse. She had become mean-spirited and stand-offish. Nothing I do is ever good enough. I’m always doing things the wrong way. Always pointing out attractive men. Mentioning sexual things that she wished I would do but would never allow me to. Blows me off all the time. Belittles all of my interests that she didn’t share. She begins to enjoy endless teasing that led to nothing. I actually asked her one time if she got enjoyment out of me being sexually frustrated and she confirmed. Gradually we stop having intimacy. Two weeks would go by and hardly a kiss. She had a very time-consuming medical degree to work on, and sometimes I would go weeks without seeing her. When I did see her she was nice at first but by the end of the night she would be so, so mean. This took a toll on my psyche and made me a bit glum a lot of the time. She called this being “mopey” and would berate me for it. 

We “broke up” several times and then “got back together.” It was torture. No idea why in the world I stayed. Now, I did something that might have been the last straw of our relationship. The weekend before valentine’s day I was supposed to visit my friend in a different state, but the friend cancelled last minute and I didn’t go. However, my friend proposed that we reschedule for Valentine’s Day weekend (looking back at it, a dickish move on his part b/c he knew I had a girlfriend) and I had tired so much of my girlfriend and her ways that I accepted and left to go see my friend on Valentine’s Day. I realize this was selfish in my part, but I knew deep down that if I had stayed on Valentine’s Day it would have ended up just like any other day, her being mean. 

This was right before it ended for real. The night it ended, I was going to head home for Spring Break and I wanted to see her before I left. I get to her apartment and immediately can tell something is off. Her roommate upon seeing me when I walked on gave me this like “I’m sorry dude” look. I ignore it and my girlfriend and I head to her room. It’s normal at first but just as I’m sensing there’s an elephant in the room she sits me down and says she has something to say. Keep in mind, at the time we were on a break of some fucked up kind that she created. She sits me down and tells me she had a guy over the night before and they had sex, and that she “felt used.” My head was spinning. We had been in a relationship two years and never once had sex, and then she fucked some random dude out of the blue. I was crushed; crying. I just- my pride and self esteem crashed and burned right then and there. That was the last night I saw her. 

This was right when COVID hit and universities sent kids home for “two weeks” which ended up being for the rest of the semester and summer. She lived in a different part of the state than I so I could not see her, nor did I have any desire to. She called one time that summer; a very short conversation that I was not interested in having. After that, she sent this long text apologizing for this and that and blah blah blah. I left it on read and never texted or called her again. I have no idea where she lives now or what she is doing. Last I heard she was at a university in a different state. I still wonder if she thinks about me from time to time, like I do her. 

This whole experience took a large toll on my self-image and self-esteem. Really it took a toll on me as a human being. I have had no romantic relationships since, since I don’t really have an interest in one. I have the causal sexual encounter here and there but it never ends up being anything, and it is purely physical pleasure. I feel as if I don’t want to put the energy in to have one, and I don’t feel I’m good enough for someone to date right now. Happiness is something I struggle with often these days, not sure if it’s related to my experience or not. 

Anyway, if you’re still here reading this I appreciate you sticking it out. Please, give me some of your thoughts on this. I have never told a soul this and would love to hear what someone else has to say.

2022-10-28 22:05:26,3,True,1,"Hello everyone. So real quick — I’m essentially a reddit rookie and would appreciate some input on the best course of action in regard to submitting my actual story. 

To be vague, it’s a long-term marriage involving severe betrayal, mental health related issues, emotional/psychological/verbal/physical abuse, delusions and lies, imminent divorce, infidelity in every flavor, and just really getting fantastically fucked over in every way possible. 

My intentions of posting are to primarily get this shit off my chest and into the world because I’ve essentially had to keep it to myself, so validation and nonpartisan counsel would be monumental to me at this point. Also, to be candid, I’ve toiled over this for months and have been in therapy and even prescribed medications because of it all, but I’ve come to accept that the only thing that will bring me peace and set my mind free of this waking hell is vindication. 

I won’t get into the details here, but I’ve been wrongfully made a villain by their web of lies woven around everyone we know and anyone that will listen so as to uphold their facade of purity and morality while unjustly disparaging my whole character. 

If it gives you an idea of just how fucked up this truly is, my therapist fully encourages seeking vengeance. Let me be clear, I have no intention of reciprocating any cruel or harmful behavior as they have to me. My interest is to set the record straight and clear my name by way of unveiling a myriad of irrefutable evidence I’ve amassed and exposing them for their cruel conniving behavior, pathological lying that caused me considerable defamation, and flagrant infidelity that showcases their complete disregard for integrity or morality. 



With that said, would anyone be so kind to offer advice on:

1. What would be the most befitting subreddit(s) to post? 

2. Likewise, is it acceptable etiquette to post the same thing on multiple subs to gain exposure, or no?

3. Would it be preferred to split up the narrative and then post separately in respective subs? 

4. Has anyone been in a similar situation of seriously needing to purge your brain of toxic shit, with an impending divorce? It seems it would bring a certain degree of risk along, especially if expected to be litigious. So I’m curious if anyone has ever been caught or called out on here for plotting an exposure and/or talking shit and what the outcome was like.

I’m 23 and I’ve lived away from home for about three years now. I have two older brothers and a younger brother, all who live either in or close to my hometown. I get along really well with my oldest brother and my youngest brother, but my other brother (I’m gonna call him Chris) I’m pretty scared of.

For context, Chris has aspergers and has definitely dealt with other huge mental health issues. He’s basically been on the verge of suicide since he was like 13 years old, was doing a lot of drugs at a young age. He’s always been pretty unhappy and often kind of melting down.

I can’t really talk about it with my family because Chris is seen as a bit of a wounded animal for the above reasons, but he was kinda sexually abusive to me when we were teenagers. A lot of stuff like placing his hand on my crotch/ purposefully walking in on me in the bath/showing me his genitals/ bringing up taboo sex stuff, etc. pretty much every day. I didn’t really process how messed up all of it was until the past few years when I moved out.

I’ve gone home for Christmas every year, but last year Chris had this huge sudden meltdown against our younger brother and it was extremely triggering. And after that, and considering all the other stuff, I really don’t want to have to see him.

I was already aware of the fact that the capsaicin was in my hands and I probably should not caress the coochie with my peppery paws, so I decided to use my bf with batteries to be on the safe side while texting J explicits. 

To my dismay, my vibrator died on me mid way, so I had to swap to hands and I completely forgot about my burning hands because I tend to be a little bit of a smooth brain.

The next 30 mins that followed were filled with burning pains inside and out of my crotch. 

I immediately texted J the regret that had flooded my mind like a tsunami of sorrow. He felt so horrible for me and tried his best to help (bless his soul, I love him).

When i'm not working, i really like to spend time together and just cuddle for a while and that isn't happening lately because every time i finish work and get out of my laptop he gets out of bed and instantly opens league of legends, spends the whole time playing, then he goes to work or school. This is so frustating. The past days i just stayed on bed and i keep hearing him scream and swear at random people online while i tried to distract myself, with tiktok or other games, and i just felt disgusted and angry to see him choosing that kind of behavior over cuddling and watching funny videos with me. I tried to talk about it with him and he said he uses the gaming to take out his anger on something. The thing is, he isn't a stressed guy and he is calm 99% of the time, it's just an awful excuse. He is doing anything he can to just keep playing. 

This Saturday, i needed to use my laptop for work at 10:00 AM and i left it turned off on the table because the power was off and i needed the battery life. When i woke up at 09:15 i saw him awake and screaming at people again, i was pissed off because he knew there wasn't power for the laptop's battery and still choose to play a fucking match regardless of how would i use the laptop and work without battery. And yesterday it was even worse. We were making out and in the middle of it, literally in the middle of it, he stopped and ran to the laptop to accept another match after he spent the past 5 hours playing and didn't get a clue about how i felt about spending 5 hours laying on his bed doing nothing. I'm sick of it and i am sure it will only get worse over time, and it has just been a week since he started. I don't want to be a bitch and say something like ""it's my laptop and you won't use it because i want you to give me mote attention"" or private him from playing what he likes to play but i also don't want him to keep doing this anymore. Every time i ask him to turn off the pc and spend tine with me while i can be at home, he just doesn't listen, tells me that i'm being annoying and starts another match. I don't know what to do. We've been together for a year and he never did this. He's 19yo and i'm 20yo and this never happened before.

Although he’s amazing in every way I just feel like I need more.

For context: my life has been a whirlwind of trauma from getting sexually abused by an older friend at 8 years old to my mum dying when I was 16 and getting sexually abused 2 other times at the ages of 18 and 21.

Because of my abuse I now feel like I need to have sex as a form of validation and when I don’t get it I feel like my partner is not attracted to me. I’m hyper sexual and find myself in constant need of it. Whereas he has an extremely low libido and won’t even kiss me passionately. 

Sex is so important to me but not him he can go months without yet if I go days without then I’m an emotional wreck and intrusive thoughts start to float about in my head.

When I talked about it in the past though he just kept shutting me down and it would cause so many arguments. So now I just try to avoid the conflict because I know he’ll say he’s always in pain (we both have chronic pain) and he’s doing his masters while I’m also in college.

* Those who are caught abusing employees in any fashion should face repercussions for their actions
* Reasonable accommodations should be provided for those who are disabled, whether physically or otherwise.
* Employees should be able to mourn loved ones with dignity when they pass away with the assurance that there will be no repercussions for doing so. 
* Customers should face repercussions for their mistreatment of employees. 
* Workers should be provided at least one week of vacation time available regardless of the time or place.

* Workers are to be provided with ample opportunity to use the bathroom.

I'm from a small country and always aspired to study my college at US. I've been striving with my heart and soul preparing everything so that my college application goes smoothly and I came out successful. Two years in and things aren't look so good now. I've been accepted to colleges but I can't afford any. My friends here are studying for university admissions in the country and my parents are pressuring me to do the same.

I was also new to LA and he was my only friend here. He was always there for me whenever I needed him and I was always there for him. I am high on anxiety but he is very calm. I would tell him everything, we used to share memes, go on trips, I would cook for him on special occasions such as birthdays or thanksgiving and we used to hangout almost every weekend. Then one day I realized that I love him. He would talk about other girls and that would hurt me but I controlled myself as I didn't want him to know that I had feelings for him. One day he showed me a picture of a girl that his parents wanted him to talk to for arranged marriage. I freaked out and decided to write him a letter and confess my feelings before it was too late. After reading the letter, he didn't say yes to me for dating but he also didn't say no. We met after 2-3 days after he read the letter. It was his last day in LA. He was moving to SF for a new job (January end). We kissed in his car. After smooching for 5 minutes, I hugged him and held him in my arms. My emotions got the better of me and I unbuttoned his t-shirt and slid my hand inside his t-shirt and caressed his body. He then held my hand and told me that we would meet regularly, that I would come to SF sometimes and he would come to LA. It's just an hour flight. I also told him that I will start looking for a new job and move to SF. And he also wanted that. However, after the meeting he started telling me that it won't work out. He told me that he always saw me as a friend and he doesn't have any feelings for me. I was hurt because if that was the case, why did he kiss me on my lips. I asked him about it and he told me that the kiss was just to makeup for the disappointment he caused me. It was difficult for me to stop talking to him as we were such good friends and he also wanted to still have me in his life as a friend. But the thing that was eating me up was that he didn't even want to try. He is single. I am single. We both text each other all day, hang out every weekend. Location was a problem for him as he had just moved to SF but I also told him that I will come to SF every month and see him until I get a job in SF. I am in the tech industry so it's not too tough for me to get a job in SF.

One day while texting him, I told him that I want to lose my virginity to him. Yes, I am a 32 year old virgin. I wanted to wait for the right guy. After 2 days, he tells me that he is missing me and we should meet. I love him and I was also craving for physical intimacy. He is also someone I trust a lot so I booked my tickets as soon as he asked me. In SF, we had a good time. We kissed and made out but he tells me that it's never going to happen as his parents will never approve of me. I knew this was an excuse as he never even tried talking to his parents. I felt so bad at that moment. I am good enough to text all day, to hangout and to get physical but not good enough to date or marry. I came back to LA and tried to talk like normal friends but I can't. I ghosted him 4 days back. He has been texting me but I don't see any point in remaining just friends with him as I have feelings for him and he doesn't.

I know many of you would think that maybe he is not attracted to me. It can be a possibility. I don't have the body of a model but I have a very pretty face. People tell me that I look like Ariel winter. I dress up well. Usually heels and short skirts with t-shirt. He told me once before I wrote the letter that he finds me hot. But otherwise, he has never complimented me. I compliment him all the time, saying he is sexy. My friends tell me that I look better than him. He is also balding and my friends tell me why I am crying for him as he is bald but that's not what I saw in him. I liked his caring nature and how he was always there for me. Also, I go to the gym regularly. I lost 20 pounds since I first met him. I am working on myself but it just hurts that he wouldn't give me a chance. I think going no contact is the only way to go now but I feel terrible when he texts me and I don't reply to him. But I gotta protect myself. I feel that he just wants a relationship without any commitment/label and the day he will get a gf or maybe a wife, he will distance himself from me and I don't want to get hurt then.

We broke up amicably but the reason we broke up because he doesn’t see me as a “wife” materials. While objectively speaking (I promise it’s objective) I bring more to the table (i.e. I earn more, I’m younger etc.) so this break up kinda brush my ego.

After the break up, I block him on everything. On the next day, he left a package in front of my door contains plants with a card. The plants because before we broke up, he’s been saying he wants to fill my balcony with plants. The card is saying that he loves me &amp; I deserve better because I’m amazing.

Now I still have some of his stuff at my place that I need to ship to him. I remember he bought me Ginger Cookies Mix that I haven’t used. I love cooking/baking but I didn’t have baking stuff back then. I always told him that I’d baked it for him.

Now I’m thinking to ship his stuff back with extra Ginger Cookies without card because:
- I feel that I promised this to him &amp; he also kept his promise on his “goodbye gift”
- I like baking but I don’t like cookies, so I definitely will give those to someone anyway
- part of me kinda want to show what he misses, just to flex, NOT that I want him back

But on the other hand, I don’t want him to think that I haven’t moved on.

2022-03-15 00:23:09,1,False,2,"People said that I am kind, nice guy, and probably push over. The way I see it especially in a work environment is I like to keep the peace, not be difficult, and be a professional. Now I am 30 and tend to interact with people alot through work now adays. I tend to be chill, quiet, go with the flow type of guy, and even keeled person. However now this tends to happen to me a bit is there is always some douchebag guy who tries to befriend me get comfortable around me then proceed to cut me down in front of others. The way I deal with it is I am just quiet in that moment is I am usually shocked and don't know what to say.  Try to let it roll off my shoulders, but it gets me boiling inside.

One guy in particular as of late has been doing it for awhile and acts like a child. He is 56 years old too.  One time he made fun of my hairline in front of a meeting. I was quiet in that moment and confronted him about it in private when I saw him alone later. He stopped for a bit, but then does it again. He tends to come up to me and goes ""watsup slacker!"" loudly so that people within ear shot can hear and he jokingly tells the manager recently to have him come over and tell me that I am not working hard enough. The funny thing is he tries to paint this narrative but he always comes to my side of the work place to have a conversation with me and to me you must not be very busy if you are paying attention to me all the time and trying to chat me up. Its mostly him talking and I am just like uh huh cool. We are in the same position btw.

He acts all buddy buddy with me so it gets confusing. I have confronted him about it and he blows it off or stops but then down the road he does it again. I have tried giving him a taste of his own medicine and he doesn't like it but he still does it. I will give him a comeback and say what I think about him and he gets all defensive. I am like thats what you do to me, but he doesn't get it he thinks its funny. The manager is a believer on handling things yourselves so I don't want to bother my manager about something so petty. I am thinking about just not talking to him anymore. Keeping conversation very minimal if not already. He forces himself onto you like hes always coming to my side chatting up a storm.

We are long distance right now and it’s been hell (for me.) his political views have taken a sharp turn right and a lot of things he says I find very insensitive like him saying black people and women don’t have it as bad as it seems. I said a word like ain’t or something and he said “you’ve been hanging around (black friends name) too much lately huh?” I’m not a liberal but I’m certainly not whatever the fuck that nonsense is. I use to love talking politics with him, I like debate and we were both passionate about much of the same things. Now it just turns into arguments because he’s very I can say and Do what I want because of my first amendment right. Which is fine but it seeps into our relationship. He’ll say very mean things to me and then say I’m too sensitive and shouldn’t put so much weight into what people say (my boyfriend??) Ive had multiple conversations about him stopping picking on me (telling me my music taste sucks, my boobs are small, etc) He only cut it out once I had to start full on screaming after so many calm conversations. Now he’s better but at what cost ? That’s not who I am.  There’s also been two times he didn’t stop during sex when I asked him to and when I brought it up he got mad at me for ruining his morning. He later apologized. He also has a history of cheating but hasn’t in the past year and a half and I feel I trust him again. He didn’t get me anything for Valentine’s Day but lied and said he did so I was hugely disappointed. Even sent me earrings to pick out for Valentine’s Day and I was super excited but I didn’t get them. Not even chocolates. He said he forgot them. All I asked for was a stuffed animal. He could’ve told me he wasn’t getting me anything instead of getting my hopes up. I’ve sent him multiple lists to pick from for stuff for me and if he couldn’t afford it I’d be fine with just a handmade card. Just something that shows thought. Got mad when I brought it up. I gave him 200$ last year and instead of paying me back he bought a canoe. Had to tell him for months to pay me. That was irritating. I don’t think he’s ever done anything nice for me without bragging about it. I don’t think he’s ever respected me. He cheated on me the first time, the second time he kicked me out while I was pregnant and did not help me while going through a mental crisis , this time he’s constantly making digs at me and I’ve had to tell him multiple times to stop. I can’t even tell my friends about the sex thing they’ll hate him forever.

This is the tip of the iceberg. 

Writing this it sounds crazy to imagine therapy could fix this but I’ve spent so many years with him that the thought of leaving without trying doesn’t feel right. I’m scared I’ll regret breaking up and I love his family we’ve been together a long time we have chemistry always have we have similar interests and life goals. Obviously he has good traits or I wouldnt be with him. The thought of hurting him hurts me I feel terribly guilty and I’m wondering if I should throw everything I’ve got at this relationship first.

i live on the 2nd floor with two roomates and one dog. obviously it's against our lease agreement to bbq outside of designated areas. our downstairs neighbor has decided he's an exception and has taken up the hobby of grilling over an open flame, but not in the designated areas. he does this directly under the balconies above, and--get this--he likes to just have a fire going inside the grill a la firepit all evening for the, i presume, /ambiance/.

needless to say, our apartment fills with smoke. one of my roomates gets migraines and pukes. the other just gets sick. all of our clothes and furniture smell like smoke, and we have a dog that definitely shouldn't be breathing that in. we've already called and emailed and complained to both leasing and the fire dep, but he just kept doing it. the final straw was when he kept it burning until like 4am. so we took matters into our own hands and waited until night the next day and just threw the damn grill in the dumpster. do note it was nothing crazy expensive, just one of those cheapo grills that you can get in walmart for like $30. this whole week we've heard him asking around about what happened to his grill and trudging around in an irritated way, but no one has said anything.

AITA for throwing away the grill?

My family supported them their whole lives and things were great when they moved in until they got jobs. Now that they have surprisingly well-paying 1st jobs, they mistreat her and disrespect her house. Minor gaslighting, or at least inappropriate overly-defensiveness from them when confronted. Things aren't terrible yet, but seems to be heading that way...*

-

In broad strokes: The boy's mother moved them out of the town they grew up in (where I live) unilaterally and against their wishes in their 1st year of High School. then after they graduated high school (like the day after) told them she was moving back home, but wouldn't move them because she was done being a mom, and told them rent was paid for six months in the apartment, and to have a nice life!  She's always been a really classy individual. /s*

My whole family has known the boys their entire lives and since their mother has always been, to put it kindly -  neglectful, we've always included them like family/siblings. My mother and step father especially have always stepped in at Birthdays, Christmas, School Pictures, School Dances, or whenever their real mom left the cupboards empty, to make sure they didn't go without. The boys loved them back and  considered them their grandparents.

After they were abandoned by their mom they freaked out and immediately called grandma. Within two weeks she freed up the top floor of her house and tapped myself and a friend to go with a van to move them ""back home"" to Grandma's house. 

The boys were eager and helpful. They hung out at the house a lot and helped my elderly mom with projects big and small, sat around and joked with her, and basically acted like teenage grandkids should around a fun grandma they love.. I hadn't seen my mom so lively and happy in awhile. 

I came around often and helped them get state IDs, bank accounts, registered to vote, and then my niece got them jobs working overnight at a local grocery store she was a supervisor at, so they only barely had to interview for it because she vouched for them. Only once they got jobs did my parents discuss rent with them, and I think since it was an entry position, she asked for $250 a month each. Seemed extremely reasonable.

Great News is they excelled at their jobs and because of excellent work have quickly become prized employees and earned many raises that normally take YEARS to earn. The company they work at is like a throw back at how well they treat their employees, it's kind of amazing and they're incredibly lucky. 

Problem is, they think being Rockstars at work makes them exempt from the rest of life. I think they are following my financial advice and putting money into savings with every paycheck, but their income has ballooned quickly so they have lots of disposable income so feel and act like kings around my mom's house.

When they're not at work they spend all of their time in their rooms gaming and ordering Uber Eats. They spend all their money vaping nicotine, weed, and video games. As far as my parents are concerned, that's fine, it's their money, but what isn't fine is the emerging attitude that comes with it.

They basically have started treating my mom and the house poorly. The don't have any specific responsibilities, and will begrudgingly help my parents if they ask well in advance, but refuse to pick up after themselves, to the point my mom does their laundry just so their dirty clothes aren't laying around her house all day. They leave uneaten food uncovered on counters and dirty dishes all over the place, sometimes mom wakes up to huge piles of dishes after she cleaned the kitchen right before bed the night before, which literally ruins her entire mood for the day.

Whenever she complains about their messes they promise to do it later, immediately before going to bed at noon and not doing it. When she schedules a meeting with them to talk about it and arrive at some equitable agreement, they get defensive and tell her to stop guilt tripping them.

Last night she called me in tears because they had gotten into a fight for no reason and the boys were telling her all she does is bitch, call them lazy (She never has), and treat them like shit. It escalated to screaming and then they stormed off to work leaving my mom livid, but most importantly with hurt feelings. 

I'm the family IT director and I have security cameras in my mom's house. I have the ignition point on camera. It's weird. One of the boys wanted her to do something, but she didn't understand what he was talking about and questioned him a little. Suddenly he walked off and said Nevermind if she was going to SCREAM at him like that, and  then he got incredibly defensive and started yelling at her about how all she does is call him lazy and treat him like shit, and it escalated from there and there was lots of shouting.

Not sure what to do. I don't think it's an unsafe situation, but it's an unsustainable one and getting worse. Should I take the boys aside and show them the tape? Should I not? I've tried talking to them before about this and was met with the same shrill defensiveness. Should I schedule them for group therapy?

2022-07-27 00:25:37,2,False,2,"So, restaurant-wise my former boss has requested for me to work at different places after I left the restaurant business, just as extra. 

This summer he asked me if I could work at a restaurant which is on an island, and I didn't have to worry about a place to live as I could sleep in his bed as he is asexual. 

The first day I got to go off my shift early as there was nothing to do, I had some drinks and then went to bed. He was going on a walk so I could change in peace, and as he said he was asexual I fell asleep in a big t-shirt (mine) and panties. 

Then I woke up however because he had his fingers inside of me. I went into freeze response and pretended to still be asleep. It didn't help. It got worse. 

I was completely paralysed and couldn't think of anything else but hoping that I would fall asleep or disassociate. And hoping that him believing that I was asleep would stop it. 

I think I fell asleep and when I woke up I went to shower and cried.

After that I did my job at the restaurant, and when I went to sleep I pushed him away muttering that I was asleep or just didn't respond. 

The last night of me sleeping next to him he asked if it was strange for him (ish 40) to be attracted to 18/19 y/o girls. I'm 22 and I started working for him when I was 19 but I still look pretty young. And he said that he always thought I was hot. 

I think my current response is to drink my weight in whisky. 

I told the guy I'm dating about this and he thinks that I would report it to authorities. But I have no proof of this happening and I doubt it would be accepted in court.

ive been married for the past two and a half years and currently seven months pregnant with our first baby. my husband and i have always had a healthy relationship. i never ever thought of seriously cheating on him or having an affair with another person. yes ive caught him slipping up a few times, hes hidden a secret twitter account specifically for porn from me for a year and ive found photos of naked girls hidden on his phone before. but ive forgiven him since.

one day, an old childhood male friend messages me. i get excited considering the fact that i have no friends other than my mother in law and sister in law, plus i knew him when we were small children we were always super close. he was like a brother to me. 

we get to talking non stop and eventually get really close again, ive hung out with him only a couple of times with my husband present. nothing weird ever happened between us irl. eventually we had gotten too comfortable with each other over text and he starts sending me old nudes of himself and his ex girlfriend. my dumbass self doesnt see anything wrong with it at the time and i went along with it. eventually one thing lead to another and i sent him pictures of myself nude as well. i don’t know what came over me, i wanted a thrill out of it i liked how it felt. he would compliment me on how perfect my body was nonstop, i enjoyed it. but afterwards i felt like a guilty piece of shit, my husband isnt perfect. he isnt very romantic or sentimental at times with me but he doesn’t deserve to be cheated on. even though we told ourselves constantly that it was simply platonic deep down i knew it wasnt, i knew i was cheating. 

him and my husband didnt get along very well so that didnt help, he resented my husband with a passion and my husband vice-versa. my husband knew something was up and told me to stop talking to him. 
so i did, and i tried. i really wanted to cut him out of my life completely but knowing he had dirt on me and could end my relationship anytime he wanted was eating me alive. so i continued to keep him as a friend but at a safe distance, without my husband knowing of course. so i talked to him here and there, from time to time. he would still insist on sending me pictures of his d*ck and he wanted my thoughts on it, so i would go along with it in hopes of him not hating me and exposing me to my husband. he was a very emotionally unstable person and still is. 

this went on for a while, just here and there. i still had that reminder at the back of my head that i had sent him nude photos as well. sometimes id forget and then id remember and get anxious all over again. 
last night, he did something horrible to me. 
he asked why i had been ignoring him and why i switched up on him all of a sudden, reminding me of what we had done months prior. i told him i couldnt keep doing that and the guilt was eating me alive, i’m married and having a baby on the way i couldnt keep fucking around like that anymore. 
at first he understood, but kept reminding me that it still happened, and that i liked it. when in reality i never did, i was never sexually attracted to him in the first place. i did it for the adrenaline rush and for the attention, i craved attention so bad at the time. thats why i did it. 

i kept convincing him that it needs to stop, that he needs to stop sending me nude photos of himself till it got to the point where he was threatening to tell my husband what we did before, how this all began in the first place. 

he made me sext him forcefully, and if i didn’t say something he liked he would bring up once more how he would tell my husband and show him our conversations. he made me compliment his genitals, he made me beg him to send me videos of him finishing until he was satisfied. he made a deal with me that after last night he would never bring up what we did ever again, and that all i needed to do was to do as he said. so i did, i couldn’t risk him exposing me to my husband and ruining my family. 

he made me send him and old picture of my genitalia, which i stupidly obliged. he took screenshots of all the dirty things he would force me to say to him and made it look like i willingly wanted to say those things.
i was fed up and begged him to delete the screenshots,  he said on one condition. 
i needed to send him sexual voice memos until he was satisfied once more. at this point i was having a full on anxiety attack. i tried to calm down for the sake of my baby but i just couldnt. i asked if he could let me go to sleep and that we could finish this and end it once and for all in the morning. 

i didnt get a blink of sleep, he texted me again the following day asking me for what he wanted and i asked for my end of the bargain. that he’d delete all those screenshots, send me proof and never speak of it ever again. he agreed and i did as i was told, he send me a screen recording of him deleting the screenshots and told me to pretend this never happened. 

so here i am now, not sure if i should feel relieved or not. i want to tell my husband what happened but i cant, i dont know what his reaction could be and i cant handle seeing him hurt right now. i’m scared he’ll leave me and i’m terrified he’ll hate me and never see me the same ever again. i want to wait until the baby’s born to come clean to him but even then i dont know if i should. i have no one else to go to for advice right now i feel way too ashamed and guilty. i could really use some help and advice. 

my guy friend did text me not too long ago apologizing, telling me he feels guilty. so i’m not sure what that means for me. i feel used. i feel like ive been sexually abused. i cant stand how disgusting i feel right now.",relationship_advice,i (20F) cheated on my husband with my cousin last year now i’m pregnant and regret it,10.0,2022-07-31

I (16F) was getting ready to go to my brothers graduation. A couple weeks before the graduation, my brother told us that there was a limit to two tickets per family and my moms response to that was “we’ll see”….?

I had the impression that I was going to wait in the car. I had zero issue with bc I believed the parents should attend the graduation. Before we entered, this was the moment my mother thought it was the right one to deal with the two ticket thing. I had went up to a teacher to avoid an argument and asked if there really only allowed two ppl in and she said yes. I went back to my parents where they were in the middle of one bc my mom had told my dad he could wait in the car. He said no and said I could wait in the car. 

A couple seconds later an administrator said the three of us could go in but not to tell any other administrator in case they asked. 

I went back to my parents where I saw my mom was already storming off. She was screaming and insulting my father and in general just causing a scene. As fast as I could’ve, I said that they were gonna let the three of us in but she said she doesn’t want to deal with my father anymore. She ended up leaving and I went back to my dad. 

Throughout the entire ceremony my dad kept apologizing about the entire thing and I said he didn’t have to. I texted my mom during it and told her to come back. The last text I had sent was “I hope you’re proud of yourself,” bc I was frustrated with my mothers tantrums. 

We left to go back to my house to pick my mother so we could get dinner. Before I got out the car my dad told me not to pick an argument with her but as soon as I entered my house my mom started to apologize and once again, insult my father. Look, I’m all for dragging whoever is in the wrong here but this time it wasn’t him. One of the last things she said was that my dad should watch the way he acts to which I responded “You should watch the way you act” and something along the line of acting as if she were younger than me.  

I ended up storming out the house and my mom following after me full on loosing it on me and telling me to come back into the house. I did not and left with the rest of my family. We had booked a spot at a restaurant but the wait was long so we decided to walk in the mall near it. In the mall, I realized I had no service or wifi and than I realized again that my mom had cut the service to my phone.  

When I returned home my mom refused to look at me or even acknowledge me but I still asked her if she forgot to pay the phone bill bc she does that sometimes. She responded back, “You’re not having a phone. If you want one go ask your father.” My mom had given it back a couple weeks later due to drivers ed but ignored me throughout the entire time.

Anyway to preface I am a 26 male. I got out of a long term relationship with my high school sweetheart around 6 months ago. The last few years we basically began to split apart. The separation was mutual and we are still friends and talk every now and again but there is no relationship there. I no longer love her and she no longer loves me. Well we are no longer in love would be a better way to put it. I am not a guy into hookups. It just isn't my thing. I don't care for strip clubs or escorts or any of that stuff. Once again, just not my thing. I like to have fun and go out every now and again, but I really wouldn't consider myself a big partier. I like to go out and have fun, but I really like to sit home and cook a meal and watch a movie or play games with my love. I don't drink (except for a few times a year). I don't use drugs. I have my own home. I am very loyal and would never ever cheat. I have a great career that I love. I graduated grad school. I love animals, but I do prefer kitty cats. I do very well for myself and only have potential to go up where I am. I like to cook, clean, and spend time with people that I love.

Only issue now is finding that person. I think I am ready to date. Since our break up was inevitable and we knew it was coming it doesn't hurt that bad. I am ready to meet my one person. Age doesn't really matter that much. They could be older, younger, or around the same age. To be honest, I do prefer a little older women but that is not a deal breaker. I have my type of women I am looking for, but who knows maybe Mrs. right isn't the type I think of lol. I like a women who isn't afraid to not wear makeup or get all done up and be herself and be a goofball. I find that very attractive. I will be honest as I have no shame. I have only ever been with one women/person. I am sure most women will make fun of me for it, but I just never really go into hook ups. Plus, I was never very confident to approach women. Plus, since I was in a long term relationship I refused to cheat. I am willing to learn anything my partner likes. I am willing to listen and learn to what they want. I am very kinky and just about anything goes with me. I only have a few right out no's.

Right now hurts the most as spooky season (Halloween) is my time of the year. I usually love to go to haunted houses, mazes, pick apples and pumpkins, bake, and watch movies and decorate. Then get all dressed up for parties and for trick or treaters. I really enjoying seeing the kid's costumes. However, this year I get up for work, work, eat, and cry myself to sleep everyday. I am not afraid to admit it. It is just depressing. Some are sad to be alone on Valentines Day. I feel sad to be alone around Halloween. I am not lazy guy. I can work very well with my hands. I work on cars, not afraid to get dirty if need be. I can handle just about anything on my own to fix for my house. Then if I need to learn my father can show me. I have started up MMA again. I am enjoying it so much. My favorite part was teaching the children and teaching women self defense courses. I like showing people how to defends themselves and keep each other safe.

As for my partner. I am a very affectionate man. I need a very affectionate women. My love language is touch. I just want to make my partner happy and feel loved. I just want my partner to be proud of me and be thankful that I am theirs. Full disclaimer, I am a weird guy. Not weird like basement dweller creepy golem looking guy. Just I am different. As stated, I am very kinky and have a high sex drive. I do like to wear makeup on occasion and I do paint my nails. I have my own style that I like. So, I know this will make it even harder for me. I know my main issue is confidence. I don't think any women could ever love me. I know confidence is attractive and I am trying to build it back with what I am doing and getting back in shape better than ever. I am not an ugly guy I don't think. I am not the hottest thing around by any means. I am 6'1"", a good weight, blue eyes, well maintained hair and body. I can grow a beard but I prefer to be shaven. I groom and man scape and such else.

I want to give my partner all the attention they would ever need. I like to give rubs, kisses, hugs, cuddles. I like to be romantic and setup candles, have date nights, and give someone flowers if they want them. I have no issue learning and trying new hobbies that my partner enjoys. I am a bit of a nerd and love card/board games and really want to teach partner who also loves them. I am a very open books so I want to talk with them. I am a good listener and want to be there for someone on their good and bad days. I know I mentioned messages, but I love giving foot and back rubs. I don't know why. I just enjoy the pleasure my partner gets from it. I am just scared of being alone and scared it will always be this way. I just know since I am in my mid 20's I am not getting younger and I am scared of ending up alone.

recently the thought of breaking up clouded my mind. he was very different in the terms of love from when we first started going out compared to now. hes a physical lover while im an emotional one. not to mention that he is also incredibly quiet. he doesnt talk a lot, go out of his comfort zone, and is always on hus phone around me. when we tried talking he would shut it down by giving vague answers or playing the ""forget everything you know and space out"" card. id ask him a simple question like ""did you eat"" and all i get would be ""forget everything"" face. i did talk to him about the talking thing before twice. he did not get better at it.

that being said, i have not been the greatest partner either. when im sad, i dont talk about it. if im annoyed, i expect him to know exactly what to say or ill get mad or sad. ive asked him questions on the relationship and he always gets sad because of that. ive hurt him a lot. even right now i feel like the worst person in the world because i hurt him.

i broke up with him yesterday. till the end we held hands. we even hugged. i told him i'll still support his dream of going to germany in 2 years but he said thats a dream he only wanted to do with me. he told me i deserve someone who will make me happy. 

that face is burned into my memory. 

i cant stop crying. im not much of a crier. i cry for like 30 minutes sometimes then im back to normal. but ive never cried for 2 days straight before.

i texted him last night because i couldn't sleep. this is the text:

""hey. i thought it out, thinking from both our perspectives. idk how you feel rn and i feel like i was being selfish when i did that. i hadnt communicated my needs enoigh before letting it get there and i was being stubborn often trying to see if i get the right answers from u without giving hints or letting you do most of the work when it came to dates, and, im really sorry for that. i was trying to find the easy way out. i was comparing my standards from books and other peoples relationships to you, which i shouldnt havr. youre only human, and the only way to get better in a relationship is work it out together, not hope for the best. i really did mean it when i said we can try this again in a couple years, but most of me wants to try it out all over again right here right now. this time with more communication, more wants and needs, more consent, more ways to improve. no holding back.

that being said, thats just my perspective. i was horrible earlier and let my emotions get ahead of me. i hurt you and you do not have to forgive me for that. you dont have to agree to try again. you can take your time to answer. as long as you need. days, weeks, its all fine.

goodnight"".

im so afraid. ofc he can say no to it. but the fear is killing me. i have horrible anxiety and dysthymia. the tears wont stop. i dont know what to do? was this the right move? was this selfish of me? should i standby the choice of my breakup and start learning to move on, but how? im holding on to it in hopes he does come back. but idk if its false hope. i want to hope so badly.

2022-12-02 02:58:28,4,False,1," I'm using the term genitalia because I'm pretty sure the automod is going to keep hitting me otherwise. 

Hello,

Brief background: I am active-duty US Army; I just got back from Korea, which I could not bring my husband to due to non-relevant factors outside our control. We have just moved to Washington State and live a little south of Seattle.

Roughly an hour ago, while I was getting all of our receipts together so I could submit a request to reimburse my moving expenses, I woke up my husband of two years and asked for his phone to pull some Uber receipts so I could send them to myself via Discord, he did so. I noticed, directly under the screenshots I just took, that I saw the tip of his genitalia in the images below; I scrolled down to ensure I was seeing what I thought, and there were roughly seven more images of his genitalia at different angles. I checked the DMs of his best friend, who is bisexual, and when searching for images, I did not find anything, but I did not check anyone else. He has roughly 20 more unread messages from four other people.

He has not sent me a dick in more than a year, and we have not been sexually active for longer, roughly two; he claims that his anti-depressants suppress his sexual drive; I have had doctors tell me that it is a possible effect, so I believed him.

After a few moments of stewing over what I had just seen, I decided to wake him again, this time what I thought was entirely, and asked him why he had pictures of his genitalia on his phone. He admitted that he had been taking pictures of his genitalia, and ""he did not know why,"" and it got him off. I asked him if he had been sending it to other people, and he confirmed that he had been doing so, and this was part of what got him off. He said he has not cheated (had sex with another man) and admitted what he did was wrong and agreed to stop doing so. I did not confront him on his supposed dysfunctional sex drive suddenly working again but I did tell him that he should stop doing this immediately, he agreed. I gave him his phone back and left the room.

He followed me to the living room a few moments later, we had both of our computers out here, and I was at my desk just processing what happened. He followed me out a few moments later and reiterated that he had not slept with anyone else, that he was sorry, and that he loved me. I did not return the affection. I told him that if he told me everything right now, anything I decided to do would be lightened (I was considering counseling); he said he was already honest with me and could not tell me anything more. I asked how many people he sent pics to, and he said, ""less than 10,"" I think five would be a considerable number. He gave me two names, but they were just some screen names and did not mean much to me.

He told me he would not be upset if I decided to divorce him, but what he means is that he would understand if I chose to do so. He has constantly brought up breaking up/divorce whenever there is an issue that we could work through; I do not think he has good problem-solving skills, and he is easily frustrated and quickly gives up. This is a general trend and not just related to relationship issues. I pride myself on being able to support my family, even if it is just us two, and maintaining a healthy, honest relationship, so I have been willing to manage him emotionally, understanding he has some mental issues that make confrontation harder for him.

He comes from a profoundly impoverished family; when he moved in with me, I had to trash some of his computer parts (which I purchased, he was on an old HP laptop from 2005 before) because they held large amounts of roaches. He does not have any skills or education and does not work either; I am the comprehensive provider for the family. If I find out more and he lied to me, I do not know what I could do other than put him out on the streets or back into a roach home; both seem like excessively cruel fates. But I would not want to stay with him any longer.

TL/DR; Husband has been sending dick picks to other men while also claiming to be sexually incompetent from anti-depressants he needs to take. He apologized, promised to stop, and affirmed his love. However, I have been hollowed even if he sounds like he is being honest.",relationship_advice,(Long post) Just found out my husband [22M/23M] has been sending genitalia pics to people on Discord.

Growing up, it was very obvious that our dad saw our mom as “lesser than.” He’d yell at her over everything and made her responsible for everything. Cleaning, taking care of us, etc. My mom never said anything and tried her hardest to make it seem like everything was okay. 

I’m ashamed to admit, but I’m too scared to stand up to my dad. I always freeze. My brother, on the other hand, does not give a shit. He yells back and isn’t afraid of anything. 

I think my brother realized that I’m too scared to protect our mom and recently told us that he’s going to a college nearby and will be commuting as the college doesn’t require first years to live on campus. 

My parents were confused and my dad was a little upset. He kept telling him that he‘s going to miss out and he’ll regret it but my brother didn’t budge. Mom even told him that he should go and that she’ll be fine. But my brother just said that they’re lucky he’s even going to college. 

Well yesterday we got a surprise visit from our grandma (dad’s mom). She never visits and when she does, she also just treats my mom like shit so we weren’t very excited. But we were civil because well if we aren’t then she’ll find a way to blame our mom.

It was okay at first but then she asked my mom: “Is this what you wanted? Are you proud of yourself?“ My mom started to shake but my brother immediately got in between them. Grandma just rolled her eyes and asked my brother if he was really going to throw away his life just because he thinks his mom’s too fragile to survive without him. My brother didn’t say anything.

I then spoke up and said “it’s not because of mom. It’s because of you and dad. You guys are horrible and you really need to get the fuck out.”

2022-12-25 16:11:32,10,False,2,"So for context I 17(m)  got into an argument with my dad and would just like some clarification if I am in the wrong. So to start off I work as an apprentice for a car company so I make money whilst getting an education I dont make a crazy amount but a good amount for someone my age however the hours are draining. So my dad is a great dad to start off I in no way hate or shame him for this. He is an accounting manager and is doing amazing for himself he grew up in poverty so he always tries to get me to push myself beyond what I am capable of. I love him but sometimes he pushes to hard. When I got this job he seemed delighted for me when it came to start he presented me with a financial plan to so that when I turn 20 I would have a lot saved up I agreed and we moved how it worked is that I would get about 70 dollars to spend to go out and to eat for the week 210 would go into savings if I wanted to buy something like a phone or something like that and the rest would go towards hard saving which I cant touch incase of an emergency like I get fired. So 4 months go by and in my normal savings not the emergency one I had about 1.5k saved up I went to a party and saw my friend had these nice pair of Jordan 1s I haven't had a new pair of shoes in two years in no way am I trying to get pity I'm just trying to inform so I thought if I buy the shoes from my normal savings not my emergency ones It would be fine I ran through with my mom and she agreed (for clarification the shoes cost about 210 dollars 170 pounds) I ran it with my dad and he blew up on me saying how could I even think to waste my hard money on some shoes and began to berate me bringing up everytime I've failed in my life and even said I was a spoiled brat who didn't understand money and  that I was heading down a road that would lead to me being a homeless drug addict. I havent cried in front of my dad since I was 11 since hated seeing me cry as it makes me more like a girl. I can normally take him shouting at me as I'm used to it. But  something about him bringing up my failures and comparing me to my cousins saying he wished they were his children made me cry like a lot. To deflect the conversation I said i agreed with him and will not get the shoes but that made him even more angry he then told me to buy it and see if it makes me happy and he will no longer financially guide me anymore. Normally I cave into my dad but this hurt me. I then proceeded to not speak to him for several days. He has since apologised for his behaviour and said he overreacted and hes fine with me getting the shoes but I cant seem to get this out of my head how just asking if I could get 170(210 dollars) shoes could set him off that much my mom said my dad has made a lot of mistakes in his life and isn't nearly as successful as he imagined and he just wants me to better than him.

2022-01-09 20:00:55,2,False,3,"So yesterday my wife (25f) and I (27m) had an amazing day in SF for our 4 year wedding anniversary. We saw new sights, had a lot of fun, made new happy memories. We parked at like 3 or 4 different parking garages throughout the day. The last one we parked in was where it happened.

Now just to get this out of the way, I know it was dumb of me to leave my backpack with my laptop in the car. And it was visible from the outside. I went out of my way to put it in the back hatch but our black pull over cover thing wasn't in our car yesterday for whatever reason. Before we left the car, I did a slight double take when I noticed the backpack was visible, but just shrugged my shoulders. This had never happened to me, so I minimized warnings about not leaving valuables in your car (obviously will not make this mistake again).

&amp;#x200B;

We come back, see the glass on the ground.. have this sinking feeling in my gut as I slowly walk to the back to see the huge gaping hole in the back hatch window. My backpack was the only thing missing.

On this laptop, I had windows 10 installed. The windows user login wasn't password protected but rather was protected by a PIN. Immediately my mind is rifling through what I need to do.. I call my friend who lives on the same property as us 3 hours away and he has access to our place where my PC is. As I'm on the phone with him he helps me change all of the passwords to my email accounts, signs out everywhere, enables 2 factor authentication on all accounts, and does the same with any crypto exchanges+bank credentials. This is all while my wife is calling to file a police report and then making an insurance claim.

Then my friend logs into my Microsoft account. He helps me change my password, enables 2 factor authentication for my account,  and tries to ""lock"" the device, which apparently you can only do when the laptop is on. (the laptop battery had no charge, but the charger was in the backpack). It also needs to be on in order to use the ""find my device"" feature. So a message from Microsoft appears saying ""we'll send a message to your email when your device is locked"" so i'm hoping as soon as it's turned on (and maybe connected to wifi) it will automatically be locked and I can also utilize the ""find my device"" feature on my windows account? I hope so.

Also.. I'm hoping that password reset changes the login for my windows user login.. the username (or email address) for my windows login on that particular laptop is the exact same as my microsoft account (rather than just a username like Bob or Steve, etc).

Anyway, now after having a full night's rest and thinking a bit more clearly, I'm wanting to reach out and see if anyone has any other recommendations.

We included the laptop (or the value of the laptop) in the insurance claim, and on Monday I'm also going to call the manufacturer to see if it was still under warranty and also if they can be on the watch for my laptop's serial number if they get a call requesting tech support for it.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess now I'm just thinking.. what else do I need to do? How worried should I be about my information being stolen? The cost of replacing the window sucks and losing the laptop+files on it is terrible but what I'm most worried about is my personal information. Is it possible for them to get access to my files on there without logging in successfully to my windows user login?

From what I can tell on my microsoft account is that it hasn't been turned on yet, or at least connected to the internet.

What I'm really hoping for is that they just wipe it or reformat it and just sell the laptop for parts or as a whole, I realize the odds of actually getting it back are insanely small.

The police department told me to call them as soon as I see a new location pop up on the ""find my device"" page... is there anything else they can do on their end if i give them a serial number for the device?

Sorry if this was all over the place.. I'm so scatterbrained right now. This is a very confusing and frustrating situation to be in.

These Right To Work States are pathetic (I live in Texas). Right to work actually means right to break any attempt to unionize. We need more unions not less! Corporations need less unions that's why they lobby successfully for legislation to reduce the power of unions. Corporations only move to Right To Work States because there's less chance of unions. They get a big tax break &amp; can treat their employees like disposable assets. Politicians can tell their constituents that unions will keep corporations out &amp; cost jobs. Bullshit.

That there were too many bad times than good times. He was depressed, had no interest in doing the things he enjoyed, and wanted to be alone. He broke up with me.

During our breakup, he said he still liked me, that he cares about me a lot, and that it would take a long time for him to move on. We never had an official calm, reasons why breakup talk, it was messy and I was begging him not to leave.

I have tried to text him cordially a few times after the breakup, even wishing him a happy New Years, but he never replied.

Yesterday, I found him on tinder. His bio said- “looking for someone to have fun with and to hang out with my friends. Let’s smoke a bowl and watch cartoons”

We have mutual friends and the only time he really hangs out with them socially is drinking or smoking.

It just hurts because we had all the same friends. I was the one hanging out with all of them and having fun with him.

I never was a big fan of him smoking, so I guess he wouldn’t mind having someone smoke with him.

It just hurts that he seems to move on so quickly, that everything he told me was a lie.

2022-01-18 21:30:05,3,False,2, So I filed a motion for early termination on the 8th of December. I asked my Probation officer about it around the 22nd and she told me they have to run a criminal history and it already came back and now she just has to send it to the DA's office. However a few days later I received a letter from another county saying I have to appear in court for two citations from 2017 that I never dealt with. I called that court and they said they would dismiss one and then I would receive a 500$ fine from the other one and be on a 90 day deferral where the only conditions are that I don't get the same citation again for the next 90 days. I'm worried about telling my PO about this in case she doesn't know already. I'm like 99% sure she does know because the letter came like 2-3 days after my PO ran a criminal history check on me. If I take the deal for the tickets it would be a conviction. Would that violate my probation? Should I call my PO and ask? My lawyer is ghosting me. The offer is only good for 2 more days and I have a meeting tomorrow with my PO. The meeting was supposed to be today but she changed it to a virtual meeting with my old Bond Supervisor. (Basically a probation officer when you are out on bond but not yet sentenced) It doesn't make sense why I have a meeting with my old bond supervisor when imp on probation and not bond. Idk if my early termination was granted or if I'm going to end up violating my probation for these tickets that just came back up and I don't know what to do.

2022-02-01 22:33:18,121,False,170,"My wife and I both work from home and each maintain an office within our basement. I’ve been working from home for around two years full time. For the first year my son was not yet school age, so he was home during the day. To prevent him from coming in the office during video meetings I started locking my office door during work hours. This worked great because with the job I had during that time, one of the requirements to work from home was to have office space where there would not be outside distractions. Basically, just not working on your living room couch wile your kids and/or significant other are there to distract you. 

&amp;#x200B;

Moving forward it became habit to lock my office door. My office door is not locked when I am not in it, nor do I ignore any knocking unless I am on a call or video chat. My current position is as a Cyber Security consultant, and this requires me to maintain a level of professionalism. Now my wife despises that I lock the door. She has said many times that it shows her that I do not respect her and because she does not lock her office door, I am not giving her the same access to me that she provides. With that being said, if she knocks on the door and I am not in a meeting, I get up and open it. This makes her very upset and pretty much starts a fight every time. IMO if you are working from home full time, it should be treated as if you are in the workplace, or that you are basically “not home”. Adding to that, I believe there should be little to no disruption from work unless there is an emergency. I have spoken with her on my feelings about this and there is no give. She wants me to “reevaluate” our relationship because of this. I feel her reaction to something so simple and, at least in my eyes, understandable is a little over the top.  AITA in this situation?

2022-02-01 22:33:31,36,False,14,"Throwaway account. This happened Saturday, but everything is still really bad between us.

I (30F) have a severe genetic condition that affects the way my body makes collagen. I am on permanent disability because of the impact of my condition and how much time I spend in the hospital.

Because of this, and because of the risk pregnancy causes, I decided to not have children. I'd rather not have my insides suddenly rupture out of nowhere, I don't want to pass on the horror I'm dealing with to anyone else, and if I make it to 50, I will be damn lucky. I am also not in a relationship because I feel sickening guilt over the possibility of forcing a partner to be a caretaker when I have worse days and knowing they would likely outlive me and have to handle my eventual passing. I've had several friends with my condition not make it out of their 30s.

I met Kelly (35F) who has a different subtype of the same disease in an online support group four years ago, found out we lived in the same area, and we became friends IRL, and we have been a huge emotional support system to one another. I was part of Kelly's wedding party two years ago right before everything shut down. Now, she is expecting her first child, and at first, I was thrilled for her.

But now, every time we see each other, all she does is complain about how much more everything hurts, how she's so tired, how she's so done with this bs, and how much she hates being pregnant and can't wait to get the b*stard* out of her (her actual words). And my complaints about whatever I'm dealing with get brushed aside because she insists that she's going through so much worse because she's pregnant and I'm not.

After four months of this, I ended up exploding at her. I told her to shut up. That she knew with her illness, she'd have so much more risk of pain and complications, she KNEW what she was getting into when she started trying for a baby, and she had this discussion with her doctors many times over. 

She accused me of being jealous. I told her that I was actually mad as hell about how ungrateful she was, and how I don't want to hear another word from her about how awful it is to get everything you ever dreamed of having.

We haven't spoken since. Truth is, I am jealous. I would love to feel like I deserved a loving partner. I would love to have kids. But I can't do this to someone else, and I can't sit there and listen to someone who gets to have what I want act like it's the worst thing to ever happen to them.

My mom thinks it isn't worth losing a friendship and I should have been the one to shut up and endured her complaints. She insists that I owe her an apology for being insensitive because I ""have no idea what pregnancy is really like"", which just made me feel worse.

Also, English is not my first language, so please bear with me. 

I, 21F, have recently decided to exclude my mother, 56F, from my personal life decisions. That includes my career in university, my love life, my friendships, and so on and so forth. Every thought or worry I am now keeping to myself. 

I have tried to form a connection with her for my entire life, but I have been unsuccessful. The truth is we are very different individuals under many circumstances. She has caused me trauma during my whole life, and I don’t feel safe around her. She is not an empathetic person whatsoever, and can’t seem to make an effort to understand my struggles. I’ve recently started to see a therapist, and I’m currently working on figuring out my life, since I suffer from anxiety and feeling lost, like I don’t belong. 
My mother puts constant pressure on me. She always compares my academic career to hers, never fails to make me feel belittled and discouraged. Just last night she told me to “just give up, since I obviously don’t have any ambition or drive in life”, just because I’ve been struggling with studying for my exams lately. 

I am convinced she has her own psychological issues she needs to work on, and I refuse to believe that a parent in their right mind would treat their child this way. She has some sort of compulsive need to take her anger out on me, and she doesn’t do this to anyone else. 
Nonetheless, I have now decided she won’t be consulted anymore when it comes to my personal choices, I will not inform her since all she seems to do is let me know I’m wrong no matter what, and I will not allow her to say anything about my life.

I want to give this woman a ring and make her the mother of my kids but i feel guilty for feeling that I havent lived my life to the fullest. I expected that by now i would have not have any desires for other women sexually, but I absolutely do. I would love to take a break for a couple months and have a couple sex partners just to get my demons out of my system, but it aint as easy as it sounds.

If we take a break, itll probably be best to live in separate places. But unfortunately she wont be able to pay for rent on her own salary.

2022-03-22 00:01:54,2,False,2,"My parents split just before having me (their first and only) and my dad married a very wealthy woman and had two more kids, my half brother and sister. I must have been about four years old when they got together. My dad always wanted me to feel like I was an integrated member of the family but my relationship with my stepmom was always tense so I never really did. He’d tell me to think of their home as my home too, tried to plant the idea of moving in with them in my head a few times but I always felt awkward and out of place there.
I lived with my mom (who remarried too and had another kid, my other half sister) and stayed with dad on the weekends though these visits became less frequent when I was a teenager. We got by financially - we couldn’t afford many luxuries like holidays abroad and such but we were never hungry.
The difference in what my brother and sister were provided with compared to me bothered me when I was very young - the only time I ever spent a Christmas with them at my stepmoms parents house I was given a box of chocolates and my sister was given a LIFESIZE toy donkey that ATE CARROTS. My brother and I were taken for a ride in a small plane by my stepmoms dad to visit a friend of his and I was completely ignored and sat in the back seat without a window the way there and back. I was about nine years old - I hardened up after that and the disparity stopped bothering me. Growing up, my brother and sister got apple macs, cameras, iphones, whatever they wanted for their hobbies, trips to barbados, private schooling. I genuinely wasn’t bothered by this because I felt myself to be separate, a visitor - the greater feeling of warmth and love I got from being with my mum most of the time was compensation enough.
Anyway, I’m now 25, my little brother is 22 and my little sister is 17. My little brother was taught to drive at 18, he now has his own car. This is the normal pattern so I didn’t bat an eyelid when I heard he was driving.
I had resigned myself to never learning how to drive. Rents are so expensive in London and I couldn’t see myself getting paid well enough to ever afford driving lessons on top. I have moved abroad now and luckily my boyfriend can drive.
I was talking to my dad the other day and he casually mentions that my little sister is taking driving lessons. For some reason, this really bugged me.
The fact that I was never offered, that it seems like giving me that opportunity was never considered. I left home at 18, little bro is 22 and still at home - in all this time it would have been really helpful in so many situations if I’d known how to drive. I don’t know how to approach this.

I, 27f, have become fast and close friends with 24m essentially overnight. At least in my eyes. We've known each other for 7 months, and for 5 of them we were coworkers. Amicable and polite, but essentially forced to work together. Shortly after that we started chatting more openly and honestly. We have gone from coworkers to best friends. He is the first person I call when things get rough and I'm the first person he calls too. He has openly said ""you're the person I trust most in this world"" and that I'm his best friend. And in his eyes were were already good friends when we were coworkers.

However, to me, we have only really started being friends 2 months ago. So in my eyes this friendship is still tentative and new. Albeit I think partly I confuse some actions for romantic interest. We talked all the time for weeks, about anything and everything, even hung out alone frequently. I feel very very safe with him and he feels safe with me. 

The issue is that, as he has stated, we've been friends for a lot longer, and I've been sorted into the ""life long best friend"" roll. Which seems to include not talking/texting frequently, or feeling ok about ignoring texts. I have tried to explain that actively ignoring me is really hard on me as I have horrible abandonment issues that I'm still sorting through. I've also acknowledged that I'm working on things, and he said he understood. But the things is he is making it pretty clear I'm not a priority despite me having him as a priority since he's supposedly becoming my best friend. He'll be on social media frequently, and he texts others frequently, I know this as every time I see him he is texting someone, but only responds to me maybe once per day and sometimes a day late and always apologizes but I know it's bs. 

I feel needed by him, but not wanted, if that makes sense? Talking to him doesn't seem to work, as I would like to do it in person so he can't ignore me, but every time I want to chat he is suddenly busy or ignores me. He's not a bad person honestly, despite what I'm saying, so it's hard to 'walk away' as I don't think it's necessarily mean spirited. His attention also depends on if he's seeing a girl or not. So three guesses who the priority is. But what would you do in this situation? If it was you and you felt needed but not wanted?

So, I'll start by giving some background. I (m29) have been with my girlfriend (f29) for around 7 or 8 months now. Its been a fairly turbulent relationship at times and we've had a lot to figure out but on the whole it's been a very loving and supportive experience for both of us.

It doesn't take a genius to work out that the only full day we both have off work is Saturday. The rest of the week we text a lot and occasionally get the chance to have a phone call or something on a Tuesday. In a way this is good for us because we both struggle a little bit with creating boundaries, and this has forced us to do so...however, it also puts a lot of pressure on the weekends because if we don't see each other on Saturday we effectively don't see each other for the whole week...or we do but it's very brief. I thought it was important to mention this because it's a bit of a difficulty we have. 

Anyway, like I said...on the whole things are good, but sometimes her moods can change drastically. She has a temper. I've spoken to her about this and she's aware of it and wants to try let things go more, but she'll still get surprisingly angry with me about things sometimes. It's not that I do no wrong obviously, but anyway that's just couples fighting stuff. 

She keeps saying she feels lonely, and that she feels like she doesn't have any friends. While it appears to me that she does have supportive friends she certainly doesn't feel that way, and even I can see from outside that she doesn't get a lot of opportunity to see her friends (our relationship has forced both of us to make small sacrifices in this). So anyway this morning I woke uo with her and she saw that a mutual friend of ours had done a hike we once said we'd do together. I didn't care that much but it really upset her and I can really see why. I held her in bed for a bit and she seemed OK...sad but handling it. 

Later on today we went and took her dog dor a walk, and I said that night I might be going to meet a friend of mine for a drink. I didn't invite her because she'd be working and was really tired anyway, but otherwise she would've been...she's always welcome to come to anything with me and my friends. She's even met some of them and got along with them....however, and I can't really recall if this happened before or after I mentioned that...she became so closed off and withdrawn...like I mean the atmosphere was heavy as hell. It was tough for me just to exist in. I asked her if she was OK because she seemed to have gotten more sad since starting the walk. She gave me a very defensive response about not wanting to talk about it, and said if I wanted to start a conversation I could do so but she wouldn't be the one to do it. My response was 'ok, cool' (I didn't say it sarcastically by the way, just didn't know what else to say...we trundled on in awkward silence for some time then when I genuinely had things to say I said them but they were either ignored or shot down completely.

So yeah by this point I was really feeling like my presence wasn't wanted anyway and I actually took a slightly earlier train after getting back to hers because the atmosphere kinda continued there. I just felt like her sadness was a black hole and I was gonna fall into it if I stayed...so yeah I'm very concerned about her and about our potential future together. Part of me thought I shouldn't leave her like that but I've been down that road before and I know where it leads. I've realised now that I can't be a therapist to my girlfriend because...I'm not one. Speaking of therapy, I've brought this up with her before and sometimes she seems receptive to the idea but then eventually always just suddenly decides she doesn't need it...it's worrying. 

Does it sound like I'm right to be worried? I'm prone to overthinking and worrying so it's hard to tell if I'm just doing that and maybe she just has bad days sometimes. As it stands I sent her a message later tonight just asking if she was OK. I got a reply at least but it was very minimal...so I sent her a nice voice message for her to come home to at 6am and I guess I'll see how that goes. 

TL;DR girlfriend of 7 months seems to have mood swings in all sorts of different directions and to be struggling to manage her emotions. I'm not sure if it's me reading into it or if she really needs help",relationship_advice,Girlfriend may be displaying signs of mental health issues,1.5,2022-05-23

Every time I turn the damn thing on, it doesn’t matter what I watch, all the shows have black characters now. They are only 12% of the population - I am sick and tired of seeing them all the time. Hollywood is pushing their agenda!” 

Me: “Why would that bother you unless you were, I don’t know, a racist?” 

Dad: “Yeah, that’s what all of you liberal people say when somebody disagrees with you.” 

Me: “Well, you just threw a fit about seeing black people on TV. Explain to me why that would upset you? Clearly you don’t care for them.” 

Dad: “You know, you really need to learn when to shut up.”

My bf (24m) is constantly making me feel like I'm not a priority. He works morning shift and I (25f) work midnights so it's already a bit stressful on us and our schedules. 


He never comes over to my apartment because he has a puppy that he doesn't want to crate all day after work which is understandable. But he also uses the excuse that my neighbors are too loud and it annoys him. So I have to come over to his place all the time and seeing him really depends on me sacrificing my sleep so we can go out to dinner or i can go to his place during the day. He's off Sundays but doesn't want to see me in the morning because he wants to sleep in on his day off. To me I feel like there's several other things he could do to try and accommodate me once in a while like have his roommate watch his dog for a few hours or take his dog to his moms or get breakfast or lunch with me one day because I don't go to sleep til about 11 or 12 pm. 


Alot of times he will read my messages and won't reply til hours later which I guess I understand people get busy especially at work but yesterday we were in the middle of a conversation (after he was off work) and he just stops replying. 2 hours later he replies and says he has no recollection of reading my message and he's sorry. Which happens alot.

We made plans 2 days ago to hangout today and make terrariums and he texted me this morning saying he didn't realize it was already Thursday (my day off) and asked if we're gonna do something today, forgetting we already made plans. He said I never made any plans with him and I reminded him about the terrariums and he said I'm sorry you did. 

He has adhd so I'm trying to be understanding but honestly half the time I feel like I'm an after thought. I've tried to talk to him several times about how I feel ignored or unimportant and he says he understands but never makes any changes. This isn't the first, second, or third time this has happened it literally happens all the time. 

I'm trying not to take it personal and maybe it's an issue with me creating problems in my head and not feeling worth it to myself but I've honestly never had to deal with this with any other guy. Like if we had plans, they just never forgot and I wouldn't have to chase them for attention almost every single day. It's feeling like I put in all the effort.

She specified that she wanted to be seated in a full booth, and I told her that all our booths were either reserved or dirty- when she asked why she couldn’t sit in the dirty one I told her it needed to be cleaned and none of our servers were available, realistically it could be a 30 minute wait

She stormed off so I took her off the wait list and went to seat more tables.

I was then engaged to my now husband - I called him crying - He dropped everything, and came running to comfort and defend me, then he said, "" I will never let myself or anyone in this world hurt you ever again"", despite all my traumas and trust issues, I believed him. We have been together for almost 7 years now (6 married), and he kept his promise. 

We both were born into a third-world country with a patriarchal society, where it is always about men. Men knew better. Men are always right. Your parents own you, your life, your future, your money, basically all that is you! It doesn't matter if they were the worst in history. You will always be in debt to them, and I dare you to object.

He was given the privilege of always being right and treating women like garbage without as much as a blink of an eye, but he is a truly decent human being. For years, he's been putting my needs and comfort first. Never let me once sleep while angry or upset with him. Never intentionally hurt me. He always tells me how much he appreciates me. How much he is proud of me and my achievements. If there was anything on his mind, he would always ask for my opinion and after a long discussion, he would express how much he thought I was insightful. We still talk for several hours every day. He did everything in his power - he is a doctor - to move us to the UK, for my sake. 

I am writing now while shedding tears of joy and gratitude.

He never felt it was a threat to his masculinity that he appreciated - me - his wife. He never let the peer pressure sway him to abuse me. 

For him, even though you most likely never see this post. I love you with all of my heart, with all of my life, with all that I am. You're the best husband, lover and friend a girl could ever ask for. You're the best father our baby will ever need. Thank you for coming into my life and saving me.

2022-08-20 03:39:46,9,False,23,"This advice, while well-meaning, has never felt actionable to me and often feels invalidating.

“Don’t worry” tends not to work until someone is given an explicit reason not to worry. My dog could be sick, just because whether or not him dying is out of my control doesn’t make me worry any less. In that situation, I likely won’t stop worrying until I know he’s okay. If I could just flip a switch in my brain to quell my anxiety about something, I would have done that already. It feels akin to telling someone “What’s happened has happened no need to be sad about it.” Like yes you shouldn’t wallow but the way this advice is often delivered feels dismissive. As if it’s not reasonable to be anxious or depressed about stressors in our lives whether we can control them or not. 

Good advice is something like:

 “Hey man, I can tell you’re anxious. Go for a run. That helps clear your head.” Actionable advice that validated someone’s feelings.

Or

A lot of the things he’ll say and do around me has triggered me and my friends to think that he likes me. For example, when inviting me to do something out of work, he’ll say “I really want to do this with you. I really want you to be there with me.” It just sounds so personal. He will also literally run up to me when he sees me. After conversing with me for the first time, he told one of my friends that I was already in one of his top ten favorite people. I just have no clue on how to even get a read from him. He also looks at me whenever I’m a distance aways from him and now has made himself more present around me.

Anyways, my friend happened to work with him the other day and asked if he was into me or not. Apparently he stammered a lot and said that he wasn’t sure if I was his type. I felt a little upset after this, as I was just getting kind of excited about seeing where my relationship with him could go.

A close friend of my dad has always picked me up from and drove me to the airport. He’s been a super cool guy the entire time I have known him. However, today was awful and I never want to see him again. 

I’m back for winter break, so he picked me up. The second he greeted me, I knew something was off. My gut was immediately telling me something was wrong. When we got in the car, I could tell he was slurring his speech a bit and he was WAY more talkative than normal. He was going on about a bunch of nonsense. At one point, I asked him where we were going because I did not recognize where we were and he kept saying “I’m five minutes away, what terminal are you in?”. I realized that he is so far gone that he doesn’t even realize he has already picked me up. I call my dad and start telling the guy to pull over because I wanted to just get out the car,  but he wouldn’t. My dad talked to him over the phone to figure out what was happening and tried calming me down. 

He rode me the rest of the way home but what was supposed to be a 25min drive was an hour. He kept driving down random roads, thinking we were somewhere we weren’t. I kept having to redirect him back the right way. Cars were honking and screaming at him. I was so terrified that I shared my location on my iPhone with my brother and dad in case we crashed or something horrible happened. I legitimately contemplated just jumping out the car at some points. 

I’m home safe, but I’m super shaken up about it. I’ve never felt like my life was legitimately in danger before until today.

Background- so in the past I had a bad experience with drinking(I wasn't hurt but prefer not to go into it nor was I drinking) but it left a bad impression and I've never been able to stand anything like it, such as the smell or anything because in the past my parents used to drink. 3 nearly 4 year's back I lost a close pet that I had for over a decade and I had an extremely close attachment to, not a month later my parents started drinking again which didn't let me grieve.

A year after that it would have been the first Christmas I could remember with my grandfather but it had gotten ruined because of them drinking.

Now onto what's recently going on- I came out to my parents well actually back in summer but I also got two kittens aswell, tho my parents have been drinking more frequently and I hate having the kitten's around them as the last time they drank they had the heating on and I wasn't able to turn it off. 

I was then ill for a few days because of it but I do try to tell my mother specifically how I feel and have over the year's, she either doesn't take me seriously, forgets or doesn't care. I have lost most of not all trust in them as any time they say sorry or promise something, they'd never stick to it.

At the start of our relationship he gave me a lot of attention and affection which I Ofc loved and reciprocated. However, as the months passed we grew out of the honeymoon phase and I started noticing his flaws and him mine. 
He would get super jealous if I even talked to another boy which was difficult for me as I am a very outgoing person and this was hard for him to understand because he is pretty shy. But despite my feelings, I cut off my guy friends and put my thoughts aside for him. He also constantly got mad about small things that were out of my control and was very bad at communicating how he was feeling about times when I wronged him. 
Anyways, as time went by I noticed him losing effort in our relationship. I found myself being the one to plan everything and constantly asking to hangout. Even with small things like holding hands, my love language is physical touch and I’ve expressed this to him, but despite that he never even tries to make and effort to hold my hand or put his arm around me or anything like that. I’ve explained how those small acts of love mean a lot to me and he apologized and said he’d try harder but it just got worse. 
After a few months of this lack of effort, I finally had enough. He constantly got mad about insignificant things like not being able to text him because I was with family during Christmas week. So, a few days before Christmas I told him we needed to to take a break so he could get his priorities straight. He fought it, but eventually agreed and we stopped contacting each other for a few days. 
In those days I realized that I deserve someone who would put in the effort I deserve into our relationship. This pushed me to my decision of breaking up with him.  After I did it, he texted me this:

“I’m sorry for not being mature enough, but you also have to look at yourself. placing too much expectations on me and getting upset when i can’t live up to them just isn’t right idc who you are. it’s like you don’t care about how i feel, you just care about how i make you feel.  all you care about is you and your feelings”

 He is an alcoholic which I knew months before we became a thing. What's worse is that he is homeless. He had a job when we began dating and was trying to get on his feet. But in April he went to jail for 5 weeks (warrant for not going to PO for a squatting charge). It took a toll on our relationship, but in a way it brought us closer. So he started living with me... In June I went through health issues in which my brain had increased fluid/swelling to the point where my vision was blurry. But he was there for me and stayed with me in the ER  I tried to give him time to get back on his feet but he began to drink heavily and we ended up breaking up in August.  

We were broken up for a couple months but in November, 3 weeks before my graduation, I was in a near fatal car accident and I flipped my car, breaking my neck in 4 places. I was said to stay in a neck brace for 12 weeks. We were each doing our own thing, but when he found out he moved back from Nashville to come stay with me. He helped me in ways that I am forever grateful. He cooked, cleaned, helped me eat, use the bathroom, shower, change my neck brace etc. Those actions showed me how much he truly loved me and wasn't just using me.. so we got back together during the holidays.

I have been out of work for going on 3 months now. I have been paying rent, utilities, and groceries for us and occasionally cigarettes and beer for him. I already live in an apartment with 3 other roommates and I'm not supposed to have anyone stay with me in a row for more than 10 days/month in my lease. I have asked him to get a job and he had a breakdown filling out an application. He says he's under too much pressure. Whenever he finds a way to get money, he spends it on beer and cigarettes. 
When he goes to the store and asks if I want anything, I tell him I'd like a candy bar but he doesn't even want to spend $2 for me because he says he has no money. 

We have been through a lot together but I'm getting Fed up. When he is sober we are practically on the same page with everything and seem to read each other's minds on the regular. He's sweet, kind, handsome, well mannered, he can cook, clean, and we have the same beliefs/morals... I practically thought this man was going to become my husband. But I can no longer deal with him when he's not sober and he's beginning to drink too much again. 

I just kicked him out tonight, but I'm severely heartbroken. He says he'd rather break up and make it easier on me because I deserve someone better. Which I agree, I do deserve someone better. But I don't understand why he can't just get a job and save money so that we can get our own place together. It breaks my heart knowing that he'd rather break up then try... I don't know what to do anymore, I love this man I really do I'm afraid this is the end for us. *Insert the tears falling down my face*

TLDR: I F(22) have been with my boyfriend M(29) for a year. He is an alcoholic with no money or financial skills. But in this past year we have been through hell and back. I was there for him when he went to jail for 5 weeks and lost his job. He had been there for me through my medical issues. I had increased fluid in my brain in June and had to get a spinal tap. A couple months later we ended things because of his excessive drinking and so that I can focus on my last semester in school. 

In November I flipped my car and broke my neck 3 weeks before my graduation. He came back and he essentially did everything for me. I have another 3 weeks in the neck brace before I can start working again. But I have been paying for everything (rent,  utilities, groceries and cigarettes) he always asks me for money so that he can get a beer but I always tell him no because I do not want to enable him. 

When I asked him to get a job so that he can save up money and help me with expenses, he simply cannot do it. He had a mental breakdown filling out a job application and said he was under too much pressure. He'd rather spend all of his money on beer and cigarettes then $2 on a candy bar for me... When he is sober we are the on the exact same page and wave. I love this man to death and really thought one day he'd be my husband. But the drinking is getting out of hand again and I'm tired.",relationship_advice,My alcoholic BF would rather break up with me than get a job to help support US!!

2022-01-24 06:43:58,1,False,2,"I’m exhausted and emotionally drained so please forgive any typos or poor explanation. 

i’m going to try to sum this whole situation up as best i can, it’s a lot. 

So i had been friends with this person for years and we met under some odd circumstances, I’ll call them E. They refuse to take responsibility for anything and constantly blame any of their actions on being mentally ill or being an addict.  A few months ago, they reached out to me and told me they were in a poor living situation so i offered to let them stay with my boyfriend and i for a little bit until we got our apartment. Keep in mind my boyfriend and i were living with his parents at the time, and i told E the only rule we had was that no one was allowed to smoke in the house whatsoever. Of course they end up smoking weed in the bathroom and my boyfriends parents obviously notice so i make them leave. 


A few nights before this while they were still staying with us, they flirted and got uncomfortably physical with my boyfriend. Right in front of me. They later tried to blame it on being high on ecstasy and meth. i was downstairs with both of them when E kept asking my boyfriend to come lay on and them and cuddle and all this other shit. E has been trying to get any sort of attention from my boyfriend since we started dating, keep in mind i’ve been with my bf for 3 whole fuckinf years. And of course, my boyfriend is absolutely at fault for reciprocating anything in the past. But he actually apologized and took responsibility for it, where as E has always put all the blame entirely on him. i had told them both previously that i didn’t mind us ALL cuddling together, as they were they only people i was comfortable being physically affectionate with. E keeps pushing for my bf to cuddle with them, so i just let it happen to avoid conflict or making things awkward since they tend to take things very personally and get explosively upset if they don’t get what they want. I end up leaving the room for a bit because i’m uncomfortable and need a minute to collect my thoughts and figure out how to best approach this situation. I text my boyfriend and ask him to come talk to me, we sit upstairs for a little while and talk things out. The whole time we were up there, E messages me and asks me if i’m mad at them  because fhey were cuddling and i just keep saying no because i didn’t want to upset them. They kept asking me when we’re coming back downstairs and to send to bf down, i eventually tell him to go downstairs without me because i needed a minute. I go down and immediately hear E asking my bf to lay with them again, which i obviously made me angry and uncomfortable so we end up arguing. i eventually just let it go. 

Fast forward to weed situation, i kick them out and we don’t talk for a few days. I then realize that i’m sick of them always crossing my boundaries and disrespecting my relationship so i call them out on
it and they give me a half ass apology and eventually block me. They message me a few weeks later and ask me if i’m still mad, i tell them i have no interest in remaining friends and they block me again. 

Around a month later, i get a message on my public art account on  instagram. It’s someone saying they want to commission me and that they used to follow me on my spam. Me being the idiot that i am, i believe them and i let them follow me. They start talking to me about E, saying that they are friends or something and that what they did to me was really shitty. Turns out the person i had been messaging since OCTOBER was E pretending to be someone else and pretending to not know shit about me that they’ve know for years. I had thought i was building a friendship with someone new, which i definitely needed after having to end a 5+ yr friendship. I opened up to this “person” they had created, i told@them recent personal things and about my plans to possibly forgive E and give them a second chance once they were clean and properly apologized. What’s even more fucked up about this whole thing is that before i ended up ending our friendship, i had told them i was having a hard time opening up and trusting people/make new friends due to something traumatic that happened last year. Now they have added to that anxiety, because i spent 4 fucking months talking to them NOT knowing it was them. i obviously blocked them once i figured out it wa them, they kept saying they did it because they missed me and they had plans to stop and delete the account but they just “got in too deep”. I told them that i would never trust them again, and that any chance of us ever reconciling was gone. But for some reason i still feel fucking guilty, im worried that i’ve affected their sobriety by being as harsh as i was and blocking them. I know they overstepped some serious boundaries, but i still feel responsible for their safety.

To give some context, he had covid 2 weeks ago and is still suffering from some lingering side effects (always tired) and on top of that he has an exam he needs to study for and he works full time. His energy has been really off with me, he doesn’t really respond to my texts, I’ve been calling him everyday to check up on him and he’s not putting any effort back to ask me how I’m doing.

States like Nevada and Arizona are markedly hotter than California is on average, but cost of living is significantly lower.

So, do California cities that lie near the border to Nevada or Arizona benefit from a significantly lower cost of living than those further away from the border? If you're living in a California city near the border of Nevada, the Earth isn't gonna just say ""oh shit that's the CA border, we gotta go 10 degrees lower"". 

If good weather/climate is a main deciding factor in why people move to/stay in California despite high costs, then wouldn't cities that throttle the Arizona/Nevada border benefit from lower costs, since the weather is essentially unchanged?

If California cities close to state borders still have a relatively high COL, do Arizona or Nevada states close to the California border have higher COL compared to other cities in the same states?

2022-04-06 03:05:03,5,False,1,"I’ll start by saying, animals are and literally always have been my absolute biggest passion and the thing I love most in the world. I’m actually trying to get into a career in wildlife conservation or wildlife rehab too. Opossums are probably one of my favorite animals, as they are so sweet and so misunderstood, and they have so many popular misconceptions about them, they deserve more respect and love. I know lots of them get hit by cars every day. I see a lot of them dead on the roads near where I live, and it genuinely breaks my heart a little every time I see a new one. 

On my way home tonight, I saw one crossing the road, I saw it way ahead of me and slowed down while it crossed in front of me. It stopped in the turn lane in the middle of the road. There was a car coming from the opposite direction, and right before it passed by me and the opossum in front of me, the opossum started to continue to the other side and ran right in front of the car. I didn’t see any gory details and I’m very thankful for that at least, I think my brain automatically made me look away. I just saw the moment the car made contact with the opossum. All of this happened maybe 6-10 feet in front of me. 

I cried for a while and now I just feel kind of numb and also kind of guilty. I know I couldn’t have done anything, and I’m trying to tell myself that, but I feel like I could have and I feel so bad. I also don’t know how the other person couldn’t have seen it, as it’s a long straight road, and I know (if they had been paying attention) they could have seen it. 

That was honestly pretty traumatizing and I can’t stop picturing it, and can’t stop feeling regret for some reason. I have a pretty soft, caring heart and it makes life hard sometimes. 

PLEASE, no negative comments. You’ll just get reported and deleted anyway.  And this was genuinely kind of traumatizing I think.

2022-04-06 03:05:17,18,False,34,"Well it's been almost a month now since it ended officially.  It all started I think when she said she worked an hour late cleaning.  She called and said her battery was dead and if I could give her a boost.  Of course I jumped in the truck and headed that way.  When I got there there was a guy on a motorcycle talking to her.  Apparently he works with her but I didn't think too much of it at that time.  I had weird feeling but thought well maybe he was just driving by and saw her.  

Not too long after that she started hanging out with some girls at work or so she said.  She wouldn't text me back the couple times she was out with them which usually we text all the time when we weren't together. Eventually she said she needed some space.  We talked about things I could have done better but I don't think it was anything too ridiculous that I didn't do.  

She did tell me she was going to do someone's taxes at work for them. I was out of town that day but coming back that night.  Her kids were there so I don't think anything happened but it was the same guy that was on the motorcycle that was she was supposedly doing taxes for.  I text her a little bit and I tried to call but she never answered.  That was on a Saturday night the night before on Friday the last time she spent the night with me.  

The following week we talked quite a bit about trying to work things out and she said I had a legitimate chance.  Well we had plans to go do something Saturday night after my son went to his mom's for spring break.  I went to fill up the vehicle Friday night. She was supposed to be hanging out with a female friend.  I had a gut feeling so I drove by her house. Well it was that guy and her there and her female friend was getting there as I was leaving.  I did knock on the door and confront her said some things I regret but who wouldn't in that situation.  She said that was unplanned that the friend and the guy had talked and then called my girlfriend and asked if they could all come over and hang out.  

He ended up staying all night because I took her stuff over there the next morning and it had snowed. I passed them on the road and when I got to her house I could see there was no snow where his car was parked.  

She still denies anything happened before we broke up or even right after that Friday.  We talked on Sunday night and she said he spent Friday night because they had all been drinking blah blah blah.  She said we could hang out Thursday because she was off work.  Well I got up early Monday to take a letter to her and leave on her car. Guess who's car was parked in the driveway?

At that point I would have forgiven her for anything.  I guess that's what love does right? Makes people do stupid things.  We have messaged a few times and she said she didn't think anything would happen with the two of them.  But even people at work were talking before they hung out outside of work.  The more she tells me, the more I realize things don't add up and may go back further than I thought.  

I don't guess I really need advice. I just wanted to put this out there to get it off my chest.  I don't think we would ever have a chance to get back together.  If there was a chance, I don't think I would take it now. It would hurt to say no, but I think my mind is clear enough now to make an informed decision.  

Hopefully if someone out there is going through a rough time, a rough break up or something, time will help.  It took me about 3 weeks, maybe 4 to get to the point where it doesn't hurt all the time.  I'm not going to reach out to her, but if she ever reaches out to me I think I'll let her know that I know she was lying.  It's not worth my time to reach out to her.  

There may have been a few things I could have done perfectly and it would have saved our relationship. But if you truly love someone, I don't think you could do that to them what she did to me.  She knows I understood what I needed to do. Things I could do better but I never had a chance to try once I understood.

It was about a 10-month relationship but we had known each other for a few years.  

My best advice is to stay busy. Talk to other people. You may not be ready for a relationship, but you could still date. It may not feel right but at least get out and do something.  I've had a few female friends to talk to and to go out with.  I think it helped tremendously.  But be upfront with people. Let people know what you're going through. Most people would be willing to go out. Hang out go on a date, whatever you want to call it.  But be careful and don't get emotionally attached in a weak moment.

We were on our first big vacation and in there, something sad happened. We were on a guided tour in a national park for an entire day. We were a group of 8 people but I could all the time feel my boyfriend admiring one particular woman. It is obvious to me that i am not the only woman in the world who might make him feel interested or excited, so i ignored it for time being. 
But eventually in the trip, this woman joined us when the two of us were sitting together. The woman was not at all interested in talking to me but only to my boyfriend. I was disliking every bit of it. But decided to wait until later to say something. The trip ended with a wine tasting session and he was by then completely oblivious to my existence. This is where the pain actually started. He ebem clinked the glass with her instead of me. And the more drunk he got, the more he had eyes for her instead of me.
When we were in the bus on the way back i told him, I have a bone to pick with you and he was completely clueless and innocent and had no idea that he hurt me..
Well later I told him everything, how hurt I felt the entire day. He felt really bad for all this and apologized a lot and wants to try to repair the relationship.

I see genuine regret in his eyes. But I am not sure how to go ahead or think clearly in this situation. I feel that the trust and innocence of our relationship is gone. I feel too scared now. If he can forget about my existence involving with another woman right in front of my eyes, I find it hard to trust him in general. 

I was taken aback by this incident because we were very happy together and had no issues of this kind. There was blind trust on each other and all the sparks and the rest. We were even feeling very seriously that we are going forward to the path to marriage. 

For now I have said to him that I will move to the guest room for time being. And we can have a talk in a week or two to see how I feel about all this. .

My relationship with him was abusive, not in all the big ways like physically or anything public, but constant manipulation and control. Lying all the time and sometimes being very very very mean to me. Our relationship was always unhealthy, when we met we almost immediately fell into a marijuana addiction together and it was completely codependent. At first he was soft and sweet and showed me all these ways I could trust him because I was very scared because of my own past. He made me feel comfortable and I fell in love. He told me about all these dreams he had for us, but ultimately that we would be together forever. Over time things got worse and it led to our first breakup. I was a mess and didn't see it coming but I eventually was able to put together that things were very abusive and him and I both had big control issues and we were clinging onto each other for ""supply"" or distraction from our pain. After about 2 month apart my mom became sick and fell into a coma and she had a 50% chance of survival. I reached out to him because without my mom he was the only person I trusted or felt any kind of safe with. We started hanging out more and more and got back together. My mom was diagnosed with blood cancer but made a recovery. Things were great with him and I at first but after a few months the cycle was back. More time passed and my mom kicked us out because we were living with her, so we moved to a basement suite and when him and i were alone things changed. He was more volatile. More angry but also more sweet. One time he attempted to kill himself and another time he punched a hole in the wall. It was at this point I wasn't feeling better anymore when I smoked weed(after 2 years of constantly being high). The basement suite didn't work out and we moved to his moms which was 12 hours away from our home city and where both of our families were. My mom was also going in for an experimental treatment for her cancer. When we got to his mom's it was different again, a new place. Things were happier and more volatile again, but I was slowly stopping my weed intake, pretty much stopped. It was end of november when my grandparents called telling me my mom was terminal and might die before I could even see her. She caught a fungus in her lungs and brain while her immune was low. She was supposed to come home the next week and be better but it didn't go that way. In that moment I made a decision to stop running from my pain, I wanted to feel it and be present. We drove back to my family and it was about a month before she died. I have a brother he was 5 at the time and I was on hyper drive trying to keep everything together, but almost every night I spent hours fighting with him. Him gaslighting me and degrading me. I was exhausted. The day my mom died he was being cruel to me even and after a few weeks of that I became so depressed. I didn't want to go back to his moms house but he convinced me everything would be better and how much he loved me so i went but it only got worse. He would tell me how unattractive it was that I wasn't taking care of myself(I was grieving and being abused and had no energy left). Eventually one day I was on my lunch break at work and he visited me, we were parked in the lot and it got really bad. Insulting me, calling me names, throwing my things around the parking lot and people called the cops on him. His family kicked me out after that because they didn't want us together. I stayed in a shelter and got my own place. Him and I made up but he took a travel job so we were apart for many months. I moved back to my family and then in august of last year we moved back in together. Not even 3 days into living together we went to a festival and he was yelling at me in public humiliating me and degrading me. Later that night he held me and promised me everything would be better. I got back into therapy and have been going steady since then. Begged him to go to therapy, he did a couple times but never stayed consistent. Time went by and that same cycle kept going except I stopped my toxic behaviours. I used to yell back and go a little crazy myself but with therapy I stopped and our fights would become him yelling or
criticizing me and me just crying then he would leave and I'd apologize so he would come back. Us both being sober changed our dynamic, I wasn't forgetting all the hurt anymore. I was starting to see the patterns and his promises were always just lies to get me to stay. I kind of broke when it was the day before
my moms funeral in february and he left me crying on the floor and didn't come home that night. I just didn't want to be treated that way anymore. It took me months of slowly building up my value of myself and eventually during a fight i just told him I don't have the energy for this anymore. I told him we need to go to couples counselling this tuesday or its over. He told
me like 4 excuses and eventually just that it wasn't important to him. I went back to him but before that I asked him to stay with his nana and not at our apartment. 2 weeks later we broke up, it was mutual. That night he said to me he knows he does really wrong things to me and doesn't know how to stop. ""I shouldn't be allowed to do some of the things I do"" 


Since then I've been focused on my wellbeing. Eating healthy, going to the gym, reading self improvement books, meditation and building my friendships. I feel better. It feels weird though. I thought I'd miss him, I thought I would want him to want me back and chase me. I thought I'd remember all our happy moments and want them back. I don't though. I don't want him in my life, I don't want him to want me. I want to be free of him. I don't want him as a friend or anything at all. I don't miss our happy moments. I realized now they were all calculated and he only took me out places after fights or to achieve some goal to control me. Sometimes I miss his body, I miss being held and hugging someone. But I don't actually miss him. It's confusing to me because this is different from any kind of expectations I had. I'm actually happy now. I don't feel scared every day. All the energy I put towards him is now freed up and I've been putting it towards myself. I still think of him a lot but its in the ways of how much I still hurt from being manipulated so long. I didn't see it when I was with him. I lied to myself because I loved him so much and wanted things to work.

I wanted to let this off my chest really, but I wonder how long I'll feel this way. Where I still think of him. I worry about my future relationships being similar to this one too, any advice for preventing that?

My cousin had gotten in contact about a year ago with her ex and they started hanging out a lot. The way they got in contact was because her ex’s mom posted him on facebook and she decided to search him up on instagram but in my phone and she texted him on my acc. They decided to go out and “talk” and she immediately went and got ready. She looked really pretty i was so surprised because she never dressed up that much when going out with her bf, she came back 3 hours later all happy and smiling and i asked her how it went and i had a bad feeling about all of this. She told me about their date and then she went to bed, the next day when i woke up she told me she had stayed up till 3am on facetime with him and i was shocked because she never did that with her bf. She continued going out with her ex while lying to her bf about what she was doing and she made me promise to not tell anyone and i didn’t. Her bf would often text me asking if i was with her so i had to lie and say yes. A little while later i confronted her and told her that this needed to stop because i was so tired of covering up for her and i really didn’t want her to screw up because i really love her boyfriend so much, so she blocked her ex and stopped going out with him. 2 months later i found out she was pregnant. I was so terrified throughout her whole pregnancy that it would be her ex’s; until the baby was born. The baby looks so much like his dad and the day i met it she let me carry it while she went to the bathroom.

My cousin got into a huge fight with her bf and she left the house. Before he left he came to kiss his baby and asked me how i could keep a secret like that from him.

Well, she listens to loud music, audios, videos, and everything when I'm trying to sleep. She knows I'm trying to sleep, but she refuses to turn down the volume or use earphones. She arrives between 3 and 6am from parties and ALWAYS makes much noise and turn on the lights, even tho I'm sleeping, wich means she always wakes me up. She doesn't let me display my paintings or anything that I buy for decoration. When her ex came, I had to stay in normal clothes even when I was studying in my room, bc he would often barge in bc 'it's his girlfriends room', and she never stopped him. I can't wear her clothes, but she always uses mine. She took most of the closet to herself and always get mad when I point it. My sister (21f) had a baby, and she wanted the baby to sleep with us. I love my goddaughter, but for f sake, no. Her friends don't knock on the door, a few of them caught me changing clothes, sleeping, in my pajamas.

Actually, she gets mad at me for doing ANY stuff that she always does.

Yes, I tried talking to her abt it, she simply ignores me.
Yes, I talked to my parents, but everytime she comes up with a 'I'm the victim, she's the worst' and my parents don't do a thing.

Now, my sister (21f) is getting married and will move out. Wich means we have a spare bedroom. And I want us to have separeted rooms. But guess what? She doesn't.
When I asked if she wanted to go to the other room, she went with 'no, I want to keep sharing a room, It's not bad'
AND WENT TO MY MOM CRY ABT HOW MUCH I 'DON'T LIKE HER BC I WANT MY OWN ROOM'.

She did it before. We rented our other house and we had to move out. I suggested we get a 4 bedroom one so I could have my own room. My mom came to talk to me to tell me to stop 'bc I am hurting her feelings and she thinks I hate her'. I don't hate her, I hate sharing a room with her.

Now, my mom keeps pushing me to say 'oh sister, I love you so much, please never move out so we can keep sharing a room forever and ever' bc if I don't, she will be hurt.

But I don't have privacy. Don't have a place to rest. Don't have a place that I can cry or even focus bc she is always here. Disrespecting these things.

I don't want to hurt her, but I don't want to share a room either. And I know that I will hurt her if I chose to have my own room.

And my mom keeps pushing bc 'we can have a guest room, and will be less of a inconvinience bc if you take that room, you will have to give it to the guests' and 'but you don't fight, you are good sisters, she thinks you hate her now'.

I honestly want to cry bc I cannot handle this emotional pressure or suck it up for, at least, another 7 years (I have a chance of getting into a college in my town).

The thing is I was fine with it because John sucks at paying his side of the rent and bills on time ($400) and I’ve covered him twice now and haven’t seen any of that money. I slowly realized John and Jane both have horrid spending habits they complain about the amount and I have to basically beg them to give me the money before they finally hand it over (ALWAYS LATE). John has also crashed into my car while pulling out of the drive way then said he will “pay” for the damages and my door is still busted and STILL hasn’t given money to fix it despite me giving him what it will cost. 

Another thing is that their incredibly dirty people, they generate at least 4 black bags of trash a day because they spend all their money on Uber eats take out, scratch offs, and other items that have tons of packaging. 

Jane also constantly has to remind me that she has OCD, BPD, ADHD, Autism, Depression, anxiety, and DID. Which… not going to lie.. seems like a bunch of horse shit so she can get out of doing chores. Plus she’s just RUDE, I will have friends over and if she hears us talking about a talkin about a topic she “knows” about she will try to talk over you and if you don’t stop to listen to her she will place her hands in both our faces and YELL “IM SPEAKING!!!!” which makes me wanna rip my hair out.

John and her can’t be in the same room as each other for more than an hour without screaming at one another, if my S.O and I even speak or laugh in a voice louder than indoor voice she will come knocking at my door and demand to know why we are “fighting”. 

Jane will also make either John or I to check her food/drinks in case there’s glass/needles and will whine in a baby voice (“PWEASE CH-CHECK THAT THE-THERES NO GWASS OR NWEEDLES”)until we reassure her that there is no glass or needles in her stuff (she has a phobia of needles and glass).

The issue in question all started with a trip abroad a couple of weeks ago as friends but it turned into hooking up and more cutesy things such as morning cuddling and kisses on shoulders, nose etc. Back at home, we ended up having another quasi-date a couple of weeks later (which he arranged). It was a wonderful evening, I loved his company and we ended up sleeping together again. We spent much of the day after the date together too and after he left he said that he felt a little strange and uncertain about what is going on. I was totally fine when he left initially, but around an hour later I felt awful. It felt like sadness and maybe a touch of anxiety. I can't seem to pin point why I am feeling the way I am, but I am semi sure that it is nothing to do with W, as he hasn't crossed my mind when I've been feeling this way.

I briefly mentioned it to my ex, out of curiosity and he said that he had also felt strange - but not necessarily bad. His feelings came down to being unsure whether we were heading towards fwb or dating.

So why do people drink it? It gets you drunk- I’m not sure why people would want to be drunk. You just lose control of your actions, you could say/ do stuff you don’t actually want to say/ do, some people get violent after too much. One of my friends dads got so drunk that he briefly forgot his daughters name. Like what the hell??? That’s a really horrible thing to do. However I think he drinks quite irresponsibly so I guess that’s an anomaly. But so many adults have been absolutely hammered at least once. Like, why????

Also in my opinion most alcohol tastes so bad. Maybe my taste buds haven’t developed fully, but it all just tastes like acid. I think some stuff like wine or maybe a fruity cocktail could be ok, but your standard beer tastes so bad. Chocolate milk is 100x better.

my partner (m20) and i (f21) have been together for five years and overall i think our relationship has been great, but recently i have been doing a lot of reflecting on it and i think we need to break up. 

although i’ve been ignoring them, i think these feelings have been present for a long time and i can pinpoint the exact moment they started - he left me at 10pm to hang out with a girl we had met at a party. he was with her until about 1:30ish. at the time i didn’t know why he had left i just figured he had to go home (we were not living together then). when i found out where he actually went (weeks later he casually brought it up in conversation “last time i saw her”) i was upset and he tried to tell me i was overreacting. i decided to listen? 

a couple months down the line he told me he thought monogamy didn’t make any sense to him - a little stunned/confused i asked him to explain (up until this point we were monogamous) long story short, we decide to open our relationship. we created our guidelines, asked each other all our questions, and opened it up. we used this as a way to explore our sexualities as we are both pan, except he did not want me to see men. i was very uneasy about that request but decided to respect his boundaries. i let him sleep with whoever he wanted - as long as they weren’t in our immediate friend group, and he quickly found partners. recently he stated that he would be okay with me seeing a man - so i found my first potential partner, told him about it, and now we’re monogamous again. he said that he “wouldn’t be able to stomach me sleeping with another person” 

he is unhappy and very frustrated with our sex life at the moment, but i have explained to him that i am not poly and any time he touches me i unfortunately imagine him doing the same thing to his partners. he is extremely frustrated with me in this regards, and it causes us to have many arguments.

2022-08-14 00:38:34,2,False,1,"TL:DR My parents separated about a year ago and my mother is spreading lies about my father and making everything his fault. It's affecting my father too much.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello reddit, 

To get started, my(23m) parents (41f, 42m stepfather) have been separated for about a year now.  My parents were together close to 15 years. Ever since mom left dad, she's been telling anyone who will listen how bad of a father/husband Dad was. She's spreading lies anywhere and everywhere she can. Talking face to face and even using public Facebook posts. She's telling people that he was controlling, manipulative, and downright abusive. It is in fact the other way around.

She said that dad never let her go anywhere or do anything. Dad told her she should go out more and take my sisters out as well. Her answer was always ""I don't want to spend any money"" ""I have too much to do at home"" (when she was unemployed) ""the girls have school"" (they're homeschooled' Ish). or any other excuse not to go out or do anything. 

She said dad wasn't the best father and never engaged enough with the girls. Dad has always worked the same schedule. He's always worked 4 10hr days, most Fridays 8-10hrs mando overtime, and every other Saturday. whenever he told mom that he wanted to take them to their archery practice or take them out for some bonding time, mom always convinced him that he should stay home and rest. He would try to watch tv or play boardgames with them, but they never understood why he was dozing off from exhaustion. mom always turned him dozing off into him not giving AF about the girls.

She said he never did anything around the house to help. When she wasn't working and just stayed at home, the house cleaning was done by him, my sisters and I. never once did she clean. she would wake up and lay on the couch to watch tv. She would make a mess in the kitchen from her multiple snacks/meals a day. When me and dad get home from work, she would make us and my sisters to the housework. Anytime she did clean, she would bitch, moan, and groan about all the work she did that day. on top of housework, mom always had home projects for him. if he didn't finish them the exact way, she wanted it or it didn't get done in a certain time frame, she would go ballistic. 

She said he was physically abusive. He has never laid a hand on she, but anytime his tone of voice wasn't sugar, spice, everything nice, she would slap or push him and tell him to never talk that way to her again.

She said he wasn't a good husband. He has always stayed faithful to her but, it wasn't the same the other way around. I may not have witnessed all of it, but I remember a couple specific moments. Her meeting a dude at a truck stop with me in the back seat. She would leave the car running for me, but she would kiss him on the lips, and they'd walk off for a good 30-45 minutes. For a brief moment when he was on night shift, our neighbor came over 12 at night and she would be waiting for him on the couch in nothing but a tee shirt and panties. When I was first let know they were divorcing, dad was at work. I popped by the house and a ""family friend"" was there. she told me he was there for emotional support, but they stayed the next night in a hotel room together, then she moves into an apartment in his town (hour and 30 minutes away.)

The list goes on, but I think you get the picture. 

When Mom moved out, Dad blacked out and wrecked his only vehicle. Doctors told him he might be having heart problems and to try not to drive. I let him borrow my truck, but little did I know, mom had him moving her stuff for her to her new place. He had a mild concussion and 4 fractured ribs, but he still loved her enough to do it and to pack up all of her things into boxes and stack them neatly in the sunroom.  Also, little did I know, that she billed him for the gas she used taking him home from the hospital, and the gas she used for abrupt visits. She went camping with some ""friends"" 10 minutes from her house but had Dad drive up to take care of her dogs. Saturdays after he gets off work, she made it his job to drive 2hrs and take my sisters to archery practice.

&amp;#x200B;

There is so much more to say/type but, she won't leave him alone neither. calling and texting him all the time, making my sisters think he's the worst father in the world. It's been affecting his job, his sleep, and his life outside of work. He blacked out again this morning and wreck his truck he just bought a couple weeks ago. Doctors say it's a stress related heart problem. I've been lucky to have my father spared twice now in wrecks that should've killed him.

We don’t go on dates much as we are at uni, but I do feel he does not make much of an effort in terms of the actual dating side. I had to physically tell him that I want to go on dates after Valentines was a bit of a bust. (Told me he ‘saw flowers in the shop, but none were good enough so he didn’t buy any’) I feel we are people who like each other a lot, but we don’t actually date.

In terms of settling, we are very different, emotionally. He only thinks logically and factually, not necessarily how I feel as a person. And maybe it is something he can work on, but I don’t know if he is willing. He can also be a bit stubborn and refuse to see things from my POV. Every time I bring something up he will always cry (98% sure it’s genuine- he is insecure from family) and think I’m saying everything else he’s done doesn’t matter and that I’m taking it out on him. I have genuinely tried 2-3 different ways to communicate, but I get the same result and I feel it becomes more of how I have said my bit in a bad way, and just takes away why I was upset in the first place. He also never initiates emotional conversations (e.g bringing up dating or how we almostttt loved each other). Every time I bring it up he will say he agrees or has thought the same for a while. I feel if I told him ‘I love you’ he would just say it back. But I want him to tell me because he feels it, not just because I do and he thinks he probably feels the same way.

I feel awful because apart from that he is amazing. He is physically caring and very affectionate, helps with my dishes, cleans my flat, gets me food from convenience store. We are medium distance (live an hour on train), so we see each other every 2ish weeks and so far he has stuck to that. It might be his way of showing love; but I also know that he deep cleaned his entire uni flat on his own for moving out. 

I don’t know whether I am self-sabotaging or he is genuinely not right for me, or I’m just not ready to be in a relationship. I have not seen a single healthy relationship growing up (parents has arranged marriage and dad was abusive to both me and my mum). Please give me some advice.

I'll be honest here, I've made a lot of mistakes in our relationship, undoubtedly, but I've never pursued another woman or even had any interest in anyone else sexually or romantically whatsoever.

Up until I met her, I did have other physical preferences, but after meeting her, getting to know her, and falling in love with her; she's everything I've always wanted and will ever want. Even if I tell her this, she still reacts this way when we are in public or even if we are just trying to watch a movie. Literally to the point where when they show up on screen, she wants the movie turned off immediately.

In the beginning, we just hooked up for a bit and then I developed feelings for her. Yes, she wasn't what I typically went for, but that’s what made it better for me. She was different and I needed different. She ended up being the love of my life. Literally, the best thing to ever happen to me.

It breaks my heart and gets me incredibly angry that she stills thinks like this, even after I've told her countless times, that’s not how I feel anymore or that she's perfect for me and all that I'll ever want.

What can I do to help prevent this or convince her that I'm in love with all of her and only her? That I only crave her and her alone. I've done everything I can do to help convince her that she's what I want and all I want.

She used to be uncomfortable, because I was still friends with a lot of my exes and former FWB partners. I always had the thought and approach of ""friends"" being the key emphasis of those relationships, and even after they're over, still try to be cordial and friendly with one another. I removed all of them off of my social medias. I no longer talk to any of those people, at all. I don't want to, because they make her uncomfortable. I don't ever want her to feel uncomfortable, because of that.

She wanted more compliments and date nights, I try to have those and do more in that regard, even though we both just started new jobs and we've not been able to do date nights yet, but when we do get some time together; it still comes back to this same topic. I just don't understand what to do anymore. It makes me feel like I don't want to be with someone that still feels like this despite me wanting to give all of myself to her and to our future together. It's the only time I ever feel like this. I've never felt this in our relationship, no matter what we've faced. Communication has always been key to us, but I don't feel like we're making any progress in this area and it is devastating me.

My sibling is bipolar I and schizoaffective. They have been diagnosed for 15 years. I come from an immigrant family and as such, my parents never understood how to handle this situation and I had to handle it myself as the youngest person in my entire household. I changed my entire life to help my sibling. I changed majors, I quit pursuing my passions to help my sibling. I became severely depressed and anxious and I have PTSD. I've done everything for my sibling as you feel obligated to in an immigrant household because we're raised to take care of each other. Please do not talk badly about immigrant households if you don't come from one.

My sibling has gone off of their medication 5 times in 15 years and every time, they try to kill me. It's always a battle to get them put into a psychiatric institution since the police often just throw them in a shelter when they lie and act normal as they arrive. However, I have been successful in getting them to a mental health facility myself every time through sheer luck and fight/flight, but the longest they've stayed is about 2 weeks, which is never enough.

 I'm in a state where it's difficult to force them into a facility for longer if they're showing signs of improvement, even though my sibling is a VERY good liar and puts on an act that they're better, but they're not. My sibling is also morbidly obese and I only say that to say, many of their psychiatrists have said their medication won't work as well because of this, especially when trying to get my sibling medicated and normal again, the process becomes longer and more challenging. Their psychiatrists often quit on my sibling because they've been threatened by my sibling when off meds. They've gone through quite a few. My sibling now has a new psychiatrist that has my sibling on a very low dosage. The delusions have been present for 10 months now and have yet to go away and they keep telling their doctor that they're fine so their doctor thinks this is true.

We are both well over 18 and I cannot do anything legally to make sure they get the help they require.

I live at home as I've struggled so much with my own mental health because of this that I'm not in a proper position to be financially independent. My parents are old and frail and I fear even if I had the means to leave, my sibling could potentially be harmful towards them since they won't kick my sibling out.

And I've finally come to terms with this feeling of hate that I've had since the second time they got off their meds. I hate my sibling. I know it's an illness and I don't hate them for their illness. I hate that they stabilize and do well and then decide to get off of meds again when they know how they get when they're off meds. They're 40 years old. They should know better when they're feeling better that the medication is the reason they're feeling better. But yet they still get off their medication anyways. 5 times now. I hate them. I truly, deeply hate them. I don't wish harm or anything on them, I hope they live a wonderful and long life. However, I hate them and I don't want anything to do with them.

My (30f) husband (32m) is a big DIY guy and has the mentality of ""if I didn't do it, it's probably not done right."" My husband has ASD and needs certain things very particular which suits me as I am super easy going, and have very few things I care enough about to kick up a fuss; plus, I'm indecisive so I like that he enjoys making decisions. 

When he bought our home, I got bored of looking at houses, as my only condition was ""3 bedrooms and no bungalows"" and I was even pretty flexible about that. I told my husband to just pick houses he liked and make offers where he saw fit. This is also fine because my husband was our primary breadwinner and would be paying the mortgage. He picked a beautiful home that I saw before the sale was complete and we've been here 3 years. 

Where we've started having issues is my husband will come to me with a renovation and ask my opinion. The issue was I could tell this was a courtesy, as if I gave input he would say ""but this makes more sense"" and explain why he would rather do the other choice. To be honest, very few renos are things I have made a priority but I did start to say ""why even ask me? If you want it the other way, do it that way."" So now when I comes to me I say ""I don't know, do it whatever way you want"" or just making a blind choice based on no information. He's getting annoyed and saying ""I would like to know what you think here"" and I come back with ""no you wouldn't, and it's not that important to me."" Lately, this is turning into fights where he makes me sit though a 45 minute explanation of a reno and he demands opinions on every piece. 

On top of having ADHD, which makes me unable to engage 1 topic for that long, I also get discouraged in these exchanges because they make me feel like an idiot, or at least like someone my husband sees as an idiot.

2022-12-08 23:25:34,257,False,703,"So there's not gonna be any major, life altering events here. Just something I can't quite process years later. Tldr at bottom. 

So when I was 14-15, idk why, but I couldn't shit. I'd take miralax twice a day, often with exlax, metamucil, I've tried mineral oil, fruit juices, everything... literally everything. But sometimes even with all that, I wouldn't crap for weeks. I've had to go to the clinic bc my shit was pressing on my bottom ribs and causing a LOT of pain in my side. Doctors ran tests, I even took a tracer pill and had x rays every 2 days, they gave up after 2 weeks bc every tracer ring was still in the same spot.

 It came to a point where it'd been 24 whole days without shitting. I looked like I was in the middle of pregnancy. I was in constant pain and discomfort, even drinking was difficult bc I always felt full. Went to the doctor who again took x-rays, made another joke about me being full of shit, and immediately went into his plan.

His plan? 16 doses of miralax in a gallon of water, 2 exlax chocolates, and a 10 Oz bottle of magnesium citrate. In one hour. TWO WHOLE CUPS OF MIRALAX POWDER. I measured it all out in a massive cup with pure fear in my eyes. I gagged on the awful vinegar/lemon flavored mag citrate, took the miralax with watered down juice bc I'm not committed enough to drink a whole gallon of plastic flavored water. The chocolates aren't so bad, they just taste like stale Easter candy to me. But I managed it within the hour with a toilet on standby.

Now let me warn you, if you've never taken them: all laxatives will cause some level of pain and discomfort. Stimulant ones with senna are the worst pain-wise. After about 2 or 3 hours of discomfort it begins. And I don't know why, but it felt like pure acid was leaving my asshole. Every time I let out some more, I was holding back tears and wait for the white hot pain to pass. I was in and out of the bathroom till the next day. By 6 or 7 hours in, I was essentially pissing out of my ass. Pure, clear liquid. I had become a very complex brita filter. I was reverse Jesus. I could've turned wine into water with the power of my asshole. I was now the bidet, cleaning out the toilet with my ass water. I could've put out a fire with just my ass. I was in pain, exhausted, very dehydrated, and just started fucking laughing. I think seeing myself shit water made me lose any semblance of dignity or sanity I had left and I was just laughing, alone in the bathroom, late at night. My doctor factory reset my damn intestines.

Even better, I had to do it again a couple months later, wasn't as backed up though. I swear I had to flush like 20 times. It was bad. 

Tl;dr: didn't shit for 24 days, 19 doses of laxatives as per doctor, became a human water hose.

Edit: KEY DETAIL I LEFT OUT: it was bad enough my parents suggested I essentially finger my own ass in the shower to stimulate the muscles. Bc they use a wet cloth on a baby's butt to help them poop. I still can't quite wrap my head around this one

2nd edit: stop asking about my diet. Please. I was pescetarian, took metamucil, ate Greek yogurt, and was as active as you can expect a teen in school to be, which is fairly active. I understand you wanna figure it out and help but docs have asked me this before and don't know either, we are not going to have a House-like epiphany when I mention my diet or lifestyle.

Even though I've told her many times we're doing great and I like having it to ourselves, she is right. No one in my family knows anything about the relationship and that worries them. they have really only seen me stressed because that's a very obvious emotion of mine because of my OCD. So they have a poor opinion of him when he's such an amazing guy. I just am so embarrassed to show others how flustered and vulnerable I am with him. I've always been told I was the mean twin or people would say they were scared of me so I felt like I had to be that and I suppressed all the soft parts of myself.

Meeting him has brought back that soft side along with a newfound feeling and connection I've never had before and that brings out the loving part of me. It took a lot of getting used to expressing myself like that with someone and being called cute names it was flustering at first and I didn't know how to react but anytime he calls me a pet name I start kicking my feet and shit.

2022-12-19 02:57:15,2,False,4,"Hi, I’m a 20 y/o woman. I won’t give out my name or his for safety reasons. 
When I was 14 I started dating this guy we will call him Ian. So I met Ian in the summer of 2016. He was 16 at the time. He lived across from my best friends house. Me and my best friend were outside and I saw him and waved, then blurted out “You’re cute!” He said “thank you!” And walked back inside. I was a little embarrassed, anyway, he had come back outside.. he then walked up to me and asked for my number, I was shocked! Especially since I’d always been chubby or on the heavier side. I accepted and put my number in his phone. He seemed SO sweet, he was always smothering me in kisses and hugs and we cuddled almost all the time. I truly thought this was what true love was. Then it got weird. 
He had to move back to his home town which was 2 hours away, literally a week after we started dating. We were in a long distance relationship. We still saw each other often though. He would come spend the night at my aunts house for the weekend to visit me, since my parents didn’t trust us to sleep in the same house. I would go to my aunts house to see him, the first visits we had were pretty normal. I want to say, the third visit, it got worse. 
He would always accuse me of cheating. So when he would come for a visit, he would take my phone. He kept my phone on him at all times until he left. He would block people on my phone constantly. Ian eventually isolated me from my friends when they would show concern. 
When he would leave, if I didn’t respond to his texts within a minute he would text my entire family to say “Hey, tell (blank) to text me back.” I thought nothing of it.. even though it was really smothering. He then started to comment on how I dressed, it was never inappropriate… but he always found something to complain about. 
My mom caught him telling me something one day, he told me to go change. My mom got in his face and told him “You will NEVER tell my daughter what she can and cannot wear. I am the only one allowed to tell her what she can and cannot wear.” After she walked away, he looked at me like he wanted to kill me. When everyone left the room, he grabbed me by my throat &amp; got in my ear. I can’t remember what he said because I was so scared, but he would make me say “Yes Daddy.” He claimed it was his “Kink” yet when we slept together it was so painfully vanilla. I now realize he was using this as an excuse to abuse me.
 I became terrified of him. But I stayed because I believed he was the only guy that would ever love me. He knew I was insecure about my weight and I was extremely vulnerable. These types of scenarios continued on through our 8 months of dating. He even slapped me in the face one time… but a lot of the time he would just wrap his hand around my throat and tell me things like “I will hurt you if you do (blank) again” things of that nature. It was very scary.
 Fast forward, he cheated on me with another girl.. then I had a pregnancy scare. Right after I told him I might be pregnant, he dumped me. I remember cutting class at school, crying in the hallways and calling planned parenthood because I had no idea what to do. I had an extremely painful period after about 3 weeks of having pregnancy symptoms. I don’t know if I had a miscarriage but I feel like I did. 
Even 4 months after our relationship, he had me in a chokehold… I was too scared to “disobey” him. I didn’t talk to other guys. He would yell at me over the phone constantly and I just let him. I felt weak, worthless, like nobody would ever want me but him. When it was far from the truth. 
When I was 16 I moved to a new town, he told me the next year after that, he had drove past my apartments and knew which window was mine  and laughed it off as if it wasn’t creepy.. keep in mind, he lived 2 hours from me.. I’m now 20 years old, I’ve been blocking him on account after account for years now. Even his new girlfriends would find me on Facebook or instagram and follow me. Nobody he knows believes me when I’d tell  them about the things he’s done or said to me. He still finds a way to contact me. He hasn’t in about a month, but I have no doubt that he will find a way soon.
 I’m honestly scared he’s going to find me and hurt me. I’m the only girl he’s ever treated like that &amp; I know that because his ex girlfriends would contact me and I’d say what my experience was with him and they were like “There’s no way.” Every. Time. What did I do to deserve this? I hope he doesn’t try to reach out again.

Since her children started to love spiderman Tom Holland is the best thing since sliced bread. 

Tom is a  good spiderman and from what I've heard a bloody good human being but you will never see him get nominated  for an Oscar. I could be wrong in the future but i believe he will be another generic Hollywood actor.

Me and my fiance (both 31) were initially together for 3 years. The first year was amazing but then my insecuirities seeped in and this, coupled with lockdowns and him living an hour away, became too much... we ended up missing out on a lot. I started weekly arguments with him over minor things. I then started verbal abuse (over messages) and he was patient with me until he eventually did the same. Then he swore at me in person one day - I had been unbearable so I understand why. Then I hit him. I regretted it so much. He was then physically abusive towards me on two occasions, and I was on 3 altogether. This all happened as a result of me not loving myself - I projected so much negativity on the relationship.

He wanted to get out a few times but I kept telling him I'd change and do better. I never did though... It got to the point where I would moan about everything, no matter how much he did. We decided to end things mutually but then I instantly regretted it. I kept messaging him asking if he'd consider reconnecting in the future and at first he kept promising he wouldn't. Then eventually he said he might reconsider it but that I shouldn't be thinking about what I want to happen, that I just needed to work on myself. He told me that he's happy being on his own and doesn't need anyone.

I realised just how toxic I was and I worked on myself. This includes daily yoga &amp; meditation, journalling, taking up hobbies and getting out of my comfort zone. Also, whilst we were together previously I didn't have a car - this was an issue as he would get fed up of travelling to see me and felt unappreciated. I also had a job I wasn't happy in. I've now got a car and a new job. I have a lot going for myself. I got in touch with him after 6 months, he was open to meeting up.

2022-03-11 04:30:24,63,False,956,"When I (19m) was 18 my father told our family he had another son. I assumed that it was a like a kid no more than five, it turns out he was 16m almost the same age as my younger brother who was 15m at this time. After this announcement our family's hasn't been the same, which to be fair our family was never normal anyway. I had already held a lot of dislike to our father because the way he is.

Anyway when he told us he swore he didn't know anything about the kid till recently. My mother went along with it even though it was obvious he was lying. So since then my dad has been in contact with this second son.

We had a meet up with family that had adopted him. He has two dads, and one sister, and all of them were nice.  My dad talked to both us, and the kids dad's about wanting to bring him into the family and how this could be his home. I think he's on his self righteous bs, but my mom really believes him. The problem is it's clear the kid doesn't want that.

Recently we had him over for Christmas dinner and I could tell he was visibly uncomfortable around the family.  He didn't talk much, he didn't touch his plate, and he would disappear in the guest room (where he was staying) for an hour at a time.

It turns out the kid is vegan and also has peanut allergy.

So I went to get him a meal from a vegan food place, and when I gave it to him his face lit up with happiness. It was the happiest I had seen him around us, and he seemed to had relax around me. When spent the rest of night talking and I learned a lot about him.

He's a music prodigy, and AP Honors student. He plays piano and violin, and overall is a really sweet kid. He showed me a picture of his mother that he keeps with him.

After that our relationship has been really good, but the problem is right now is that my dad is still pushing the ""join the family"" rhetoric.

The kid is shy, so how exactly can I go about tell my dad to step off about the subject?

\[UPDATE\]

I didn't expect my post to get this much attention and thank you everyone for the advice.

I do want to explain more about my half brother situation and answer some of the questions you guys have asked.

My half brother Dad's have set boundaries already with my father about things. Also his Dad's are in no way trying to give him up. They've made that extremely clear and one of them doesn't even like the idea of this weird family thing my dad is trying to impose. My half brother told me he had to even beg his fathers about the whole staying over thing. He also say's he didn't tell them about the food incident because he really doesn't want give them anymore reason for them to not like my dad. It took a whole month for him to even to convince them into even letting him stay for the Christmas dinner and all he stayed for was 2 days.

It's not a financial thing either, both of his dads have pretty good jobs. They also take really good care of both him and his sister. While talking to him, I could tell his dad's really truly invest their time into both him and his sister.

Another answer to a question, my father was not a sperm donor. He did cheat on my mother and it resulted in my half brother.

My half brother's mother passed when he was young and is no longer with him. The picture is one of the only things he does have left of her. My half brother told me that he doesn't want to input himself into our family, and blow things up, he just wants to know more about his mother. I've told him there is no way he'd do that, and that he has every right to want to know more about his mother. I just really want to make it clear to him that him wanting to know more mother is no way ruining our family, and his questions are completely fine to want to ask about.

I think my dad's overstepping with this, and I've told him that maybe he needs to take more time with building a relationship. I just don't want my half brother to either get swept up into my dad self righteousness, or have to deal with actually knowing his real father. Because my father isn't all that of a person to get to know, but that's just my experience with him.

On one occasion he came home and admitted he needed to pee so badly that day that he relieved himself in a bottle. I was understanding up until the point I realised he still had the bottle in his bag, after which I became a little incredulous as to why he hadn't thrown it out yet. I definitely caused him some shame with my reaction, which was half-bewildered and half-laughing, and since then he's been kinda weird about the whole thing. 

By weird I mean he often worries before and during work about whether he's been to the bathroom recently, whether he's drunk too much liquid, and even whether he has an empty bottle handy in case things get desperate. He gets these thoughts even if he's just been to the bathroom - apparently once he's left the house he just gets anxious at the possibility of actually wetting himself, the worst-case scenario.

Recently the two of us were waiting for a bus that would drop us right outside our house, and without any notice he orders an uber that ends up arriving at exactly the same time as the bus anyway. I was already annoyed at this senseless waste of money, when halfway home my BF asks the driver to pull over next to his relative's house 'to pick up some mail', leaving me alone with the uber driver for what felt like ages before he returned and we continued home. 

We get home and I ask him to give me a heads up next time he intends to leave me alone in a stranger's car, because I had no warning and it made me uncomfortable. He admits that the reason he ordered the uber and then requested the impromptu stop was because he felt he needed to pee again, which explains why picking up mail took so long. Ultimately he said that he barely peed at all when he made it to the bathroom- he just felt anxious that he hadn't done so before we left. 

I'm not unfamiliar with intrusive and irrational thoughts but I'm beginning to feel like this is starting to affect him more than it should, what with him making impulsive purchases and decisions that affect other people. I recommended he speak with his work's counselling service about it but I find myself personally losing patience for it.

This is gonna be a semi long one so buckle up. Get comfy. 

So I (17M) am an introvert in real life. I only had one friend but unfortunately lost contact with them as I moved away from where they lived. 

Part 1: in 2020 I had alot. Good friends. (both parts are online people) and a SO. But eventually after talking a tad bit too much about my past they All confronted me. Course me being 16 and dumb at the time (still am) I just ran from everything as I didn't wanna face it. I lost contact with everybody I knew.


Part 2: few months later I found a new group of friends. They were really sweet and took me in. Things were getting back on track. I got help. And things were like the way they were before. Until last week. 

Now I will admit. What I said at the time was shitty. It's kinda haze now as I wanna forget I said it. But I said something along the lines of ""what do you expect me to do? You say you trust us yet you say you have trust issues? Gee thanks."" 

Not a proud moment and you can blast me as much as you want. Honestly. I deserve it. But after they left I left too. 


I ended up supposingly making up with them that same night. They forgave me but I knew I had to do more. So I went back and said something like ""I'm sorry I let my emotions get to me. That was dangerous. I failed you all."" then. I was told to leave and to give everyone time.

2022-07-13 05:21:47,13,False,2,"First off, this is a repost with some minor edits to details I should've included in the first post.

I'd like to start this off by saying I'm sorry if this comes off a little weird and out of order, I've never been the best and conveying what I'm trying to say into text.

I (19F) have a friend (20F) of just about 12 years, we met in Kindergarten years ago. We grew up together, and I consider her my sister. The only issue is, she got pregnant at 17, and had her son, let's just call him Q for privacy reasons, and she can't take care of him.

When I say she can't take care of him, I don't mean that she's physically incapable, I mean she's financially incapable. I moved from our home state nearly 2 years ago, and ever since then she's been texting me periodically asking me to send money for nicotine and diapers.

She's an irresponsible mother, and she lives in a house with 10 other people, her family, and does not have a bedroom of her own. Her baby doesn't even have a crib, he sleeps in bed with her. Which I guess isn't too bad?

The fact that 10 people, not including herself and Q, live there wouldn't be an issue, if the house was bigger. There's no space. 90% of the houses occupants are kids from the ages of 3-12 so the house is also extremely chaotic all of the time. It's also unsafe and never clean, there's roaches almost everywhere.

She has a half brother, D, who is also not allowed to be near the younger kids alone, due to the fact that he's a budding psychopath at just 9 years old. For reasons I'm not allowed to say due to the rules of this sub.

She doesn't have a job, she says she got fired because of the fact that she got COVID and couldn't go in for a couple of days, which I'm not completely sure is the truth.

She also doesn't feed her baby regular baby food. He eats whatever the other people in the house are eating, and she fills his baby bottle with Mt Dew.

The only reason I feel I'd be the asshole, is because if CPS goes there, there's a chance they'd possibly remove all of the kids from the home, and I'd feel like a major asshole if that happened.

We currently live 11 hours apart, two entirely different states. Her the one we grew up in, me in the one I was born in. I don't know how CPS really works, so I don't know if this information would hinder anything. Also I'm just not sure if the end result would end up with all kids taken out of the house, since I'd be reporting for Q and the rest of the kids aren't her own.. I'm just really not well educated on this stuff, and I don't know if calling CPS would make things worse.

throwaway. this whole situation is so bizarre that I still can't really process it. it still doesn’t feel real but I feel scared and guilty

I (19F) had surgery a couple days ago to get all 4 of my wisdom teeth out and because I have a really bad fear of dentists, they had to drug me pretty hard to do the removal. Not like laughing gas that wears off really fast, but actual IV medicine so I was pretty much unconscious during the whole thing. They told me to have a ""responsible adult"" drive me to the appointment and back because the meds they gave me would make it dangerous to drive. My mom was on a work trip and couldn’t take me, so I asked my sister in law Bri (24, not her real name) if she could do it as the whole thing would only take an hour or two. I even offered gas money because the dental office is about 45 minutes away. I would have asked my brother but he works during the day while bri is a stay at home mom to their 2yo daughter who I think was at bri's mom's house that day.

Bri agreed to take me to my appointment and the surgery went fine, bri waited in the lobby for me to be done. When I came out of anesthesia I was very disoriented and nauseous, which I guess is normal. I had gauze shoved in my mouth to stop any bleeding and bri took me to her car after I was let go.

I don’t really remember much of the drive but it felt like not enough time passed before bri got out of the car and told me to come with her. I was really out of it and just followed her because the alternative was staying in the hot car.

long story short, we were at a pool?? I was really confused but once we were through the gate bri basically parked me at one of those little table-benches said she'd be back in a while. I was still trying not to puke and was really dizzy from the heat (90+ degrees) and the drugs, so I asked her to take me home but she wouldn't. I guess since it was her day off and she didn’t have my niece she was meeting friends at the pool. I was starting to feel really sick and on the verge of passing out or having a panic attack, so I called my brother. I don’t think he could understand me between the meds and the stuff in my mouth because he hung up and I guess called bri because she came stomping back over, cussing and yelling at me, and took me back to the car. I passed out on the drive home, but when we arrived my brother had left work and met us in the driveway. He was screaming at bri and she was crying. I was still pretty disoriented but my brother took me back home and stayed with me until the meds wore off. That's when he told me he's divorcing bri because of what she did plus some other things he didn’t go into detail about.

It's been a few days since then and bri has been blowing up my phone telling me what a bitch I am and how me tattling destroyed her family. Part of me feels bad because of my niece and I wonder if I should've jjst dealt with it and waited for her to be done at the pool instead of calling my bro and causing problems.

It got to a point that one of my cousins asked why she kept making me come. He didn't even say it in a mean or complaining way, he was just confused.

I really need some advice. So on the weekend my boyfriend and I had a fight over my teasing of him over an ex we saw at the mall and he literally told me to fuck off and left. However, since he was my drive, we just tried to just ignore it for the time being as he drove me home. Afterwards, when we got home he called me to tell me he was super tired and was going to bed while being very irritable and when I asked him to talk about what happened with me he just said nah and that he wanted to go to bed and would solve it tmrow when he got back from work. But that rrly bothered me then cuz he had a late shift from the afternoon to midnight so he had the entire morning to talk to me and solve things. But whatever. Anyways after this I got a bit annoyed and swore at him a little and we ended the call. However, the next morning he tells me Goodmorning and then tells me he’s going to go hang out with his friends which he did for the whole day untill his shift.  This is what rrly set me off becuase he’s promised me so many times that we will try to communicate better and talk things out when a problem arises - but instead he goes out to hang out with his friends. Finally, I just ignored him for most of the day until at night I texted him that we can just talk when he gets home. However at this time he was annoyed that I ignored him and told me he didn’t want to talk and he was going to bed. I asked him if he wanted to stay tgt and he said I don’t know don’t ask me and when i asked if he even cared about us he said goodnight. I then just responded with ok and since then we haven’t spoken. I left him on read on another platform we msg off of, and he hasn’t texted me back since either . It’s been 5 days and since then I’ve seen all he’s done is go out with his friends and play video games. I’ve been feeling horrible and sad but I don’t want to text him first since he didn’t respond to my text - plus I feel like I’m constantly the one that needs to reach out to him to talk about problems. In the past he has had a history of stonewalling me and liteally told me he doesn’t reach out cuz he knows eventually I will. 

I care for him but I’m just tired of always having to be the one that seems to care - I don’t know if we’re broken up or what it is we’re doing which makes things worse. Any advice to what I should do next is appreciated. Also my parents don’t like him so I don’t know maybe if it’s just one to end things here without any closure.

So we exchange information and I call his agent, because he told me to. It went alright, except for the claims agent leaving the claim open for a month. His insurance finally claimed liability and we got to scheduling and estimates. 

Through all the scheduling I was told I would get a rental car to cover the time my car would be in the shop (about 9 days).

I made sure the insurance agent knew I was 17 and she had my license on file.

Today comes and I arrive at the dealership and drop my car off. Everything is going well. The rental agent arrives with my rent car sees me and asks me if I was under 21. I say yes and she starts tapping away at her tablet. She then makes a call with my insurance to make sure its ok.

She takes a look at my liscence, which she was entering into the rental database, and asks me if I was under 18. I said yea and she kind of just sighed. She said I had to have a parent come by and sign off. Both of my parents were occupied at work so the rental agent drove me back to my house and I would come back later today with a parent.

So my dad and I get to the rental place and were greeted by a manager who said I couldn’t rent a car or drive a rented car because I couldn’t sign any legally binding papers.

I’m honestly really lucky that the bullying has begun to tone down since i’ve begun high school, but every year before that since 3rd grade has been absolutely relentless. Kids would call me mean names and hit me with rulers in elementary, which soon turned to getting beat up and called slurs regarding my sexuality in middle school. On top of that, my home life wasn’t ideal, so i had a lot of mental health issues. I wasn’t doing my very best and had a really hard time with everything up until last year, and i’ve been doing better as of recently. 

Now to the current situation. Me and my sister (6) have to do chores daily. It’s not a big deal for me, but she absolutely despises chores and will throw an entire fit where she destroys things, screams, cries, and accuses people of hitting her when someone does so much as mention chores. I get it, i didn’t like chores either at her age, but her reaction is a bit extreme considering the only chore she’s assigned is picking up her toys and papers. Our parents do nothing to stop this, and usually i’m the one who gets in trouble for not having done my chores during her tantrum. It’s virtually impossible to clean while shes having a fit though. She will purposefully destroy only the spot that you’re cleaning in, and sometimes she’ll stop crying to laugh about it. She very much enjoys getting a rise out of people, which is concerning because i don’t want her to start being like that at such a young age. 

Well today we were doing our chores, and she kept refusing to do them. Usually it doesn’t bother me too much, and i’ll end up just have to pick up all her toys later, but she was making a mess in the living room which is where i cleaning. Every time i would clean an area, she would throw stuff there like dirty clothes from the hamper, toys, and food. It was making cleaning an impossible task. I asked her if she could please help with chores instead of making a bigger mess. She didn’t immediately go and lie to our parents about me punching her or whatever, which surprised me. Instead she said “mommy and daddy said you had a bad childhood, why are you trying to do that to me? i don’t like you now.” I was genuinely so shocked it took me maybe a solid minute to respond to her. I was seriously appalled that my parents would tell a literal 6 year old about their older sibling being bullied so it could be used against me. I also thought there was no way she just came up with that herself, and someone probably put the idea in her head that me asking her to pick up her mess is equivalent to the years of trauma i experienced. 

Anyways, i was pissed. I told her that was a really mean thing to say, and that she really hurt my feelings, and not to say it again. I immediately stormed off to my parents room right after and began yelling at them, asking them why on earth would they tell her about my bad childhood like that. They said that i was a bad sibling for bossing her around with chores, and thought it would be fair to tell her that i’m doing the same thing to her that those kids did to me all those years ago. I told them they were insane and to not talk to me for the rest of the night. I stormed off to my own room and cried for hours. 

I think i might be the asshole because i’m afraid that they’re right about me being a horrible sibling.

The kid didn't show any signs of leaving the cat alone and it was really upsetting me so I started getting out of my seat to take the cat off her, then I saw the mum's face and sat back down and carried on basically begging the kid to let the poor cat go. The mum was doing the whole ""Sweetheart! I know you *mean* well..."" bit to the kid which was totally ineffective. 

When the cat's owner came back in, she luckily swooped in and picked up the cat, the kid kicked off for a short while then got bored and went back to hang out with the other kids. 

I don't want to seem all anti-child, most of my friend's kids are pretty good with animals and I never had a problem with this kid before. Young kids don't exactly have an amazing grasp on empathy and I'm definitely not saying she's cruel or evil. That doesn't mean I have to let the poor cat suffer though. 

The kid's mum (and a couple of other parent friends) were pissed off that I ""disciplined"" the child, especially when her mum was right there and especially when I have exactly zero parenting experience myself. The mum said the cat would have hissed or scratched if she was upset which really pissed me off, I don't think it's ok to scare a cat so much it hisses, especially when this particular cat has probably never hissed or scratched in her entire life. I wasn't trying to discipline, I just got stressed out and upset seeing a cat getting hurt.",AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling off someone else's child?,558.0,2022-10-06

Now things really turned fast, after the first date a year ago he asked me to be his girlfriend and I said yes, we never had spent a day apart from each other and I even moved in within months (I was love blinded I know huge red flags) 
Now during this relationship I’ve had to cut off a lot of friends or just distanced myself away because he never really get along with them, and if I go see family Insstead of making plans with him he would get offended 
Well right before I moved in with him I had a miscarriage, I called two days off of work and I got fired the day I went back. That job was my favorite place so I was not only grieving that but my miscarriage too. 
I then became sad and distant, along with not being as sexually motivated. He’s guilted me, made me feel bad, he’s said that it’s made him depressed, now I’ve told him I get sad and when I’m sad I just don’t like to have sex and communicated on that for awhile. Also he’s gotten super paranoid of me, went through my phone every night or a lot of nights, even went through messages since before the relationship began or years before it began, but I can’t touch his phone. We broke up about a week ago. He dumped me in the middle of a fight about sex. Told me that I’m the reason all of this is happening. I’m the reason he’s gotten paranoid (I’ve never cheated on him or gave him a reason to doubt me) I’m the reason this always blows up
I’m just doubting myself

2022-11-10 19:08:41,2,False,3,"TW: mentions of su1c1dal ideations, self-h4tred, loss of loved one

I am someone who moved from the country I was living in about 3 years ago so as to seek a better life. I moved with my family and I was a wreck. I was going through culture shock and the stress of being the new kid at my school (I was 15 at the time). 

Upon moving, I was able to keep in touch with friends from back home and especially this one friend of mine. We'll call them P. P and I have been friends for a while and we're really close. We have trusted each other with a lot and in general we have always cared for each other's wellbeing. However, looking back on our years of friendship and how things are now, I feel weird.

Like I said in the beginning of moving I was a wreck. Me and P would spend hours (as much time as the time zone difference allowed along with school hours) texting and talking to eachother. It helped me a lot in the beginning because it was hard for me to make friends. But I feel that it also put pressure on me. I would have to do other daily things and many times I would not do a lot of stuff that would have been beneficial to me because P wanted us to talk. I felt that I didn't have a choice and that I owed them my time because they continued to be my friend after I moved (I lost touch with a lot of my other friends which is why I felt like I owed P). Because of this I feel that I missed out on a lot. Not only did I feel like I owed them my time but I felt I had to constantly talk to them because if I didn't they would suffer through panic attacks. Not only that but many times they thought it meant I didn't want to be their friend anymore. They would spiral down a negative mindset and even mention suicidal ideations or go through harmful tendencies because of that. 

There were bad times and there were good times between us. But for a very long time, consecutive years, our friendship felt to me like it was one-sided. They have been through a lot in their life and I know that they're still struggling whereas my life is better-off now. That only made/makes me feel guiltier. It felt like I had to try and help them out with their struggles and be there for them emotionally. I became closed off and avoided telling them anything regarding my interests or things on my mind (positive and/or negative). Whenever I would finish school there would always be something bothering them (family issues, friend drama, school problems, self-hatred) and I had to be there to help them out. I became their ""therapist"" partially because I did care about them but also because I felt it was my repsonsibility. I was worried of them hurting themselves so I put myself aside to help them. 

Even back then I saw the severity of their emotional struggles and many times I advised P to seek some support from professionals because their anxiety levels and panic attacks were constantly seeming to get worse. Those types of convos would always lead to nowhere because P would go on about how their parents were close-minded (which I knew they were) and how they didn't believe in stuff like therapy and mental disorders. Their parents wouldn't take them to get the care they needed and weren't always the best in helping P out when they were suffering through panic attacks. In general, the environment P was living in and the losses they suffered (they lost their grandma during the pandemic as well) were putting a heavy mental toll on them and I always tried my best to help them when they didn't have the support they needed because I was worried of losing them and I knew they had no one else to support them. All of this made me feel more like I was there because P had no one to help them and it became even less like a friendship. I felt like it was a burden. It's not like I don't like P; I really love them and care for them even to this day. It's just that all this stress has impacted me a lot and I still feel pressure.

However, a bit more than half a year ago P was finally able to begin treatment. They're still going to treatment since then and things are really looking better for them. P has been able to find a treatment plan that's very effective for them and for months now they aren't suffering as many panic attacks as they used to and they generally feel like themselves again. P has grown a lot and I am so do happy for their improvement but I still feel traumatized after all the stuff that's happened within these years. 

I am still closed off to them and actually even moreso than how it used to be. Whenever I get a notification from the app we use to communicate I stress to quickly look at it so as to ensure it's them or not. All these years of talking to them conditioned me to keep my mind on my phone in case they text me. It feels like a responsibility to respond back to them rather than me genuinely wanting to talk to them. I've grown sick of talking with them so often and whenever we text I usually have nothing of value to say. I just respond to whatever they have to tell me about how their day went. Whereas now I feel after so long of devoting my time to them, I do nothing for myself anymore. 

My day consists of going to my lectures when I have to go to them and when I'm done I spend the rest of my day at home. P has a life there where they can go out and do things and hang out with friends whereas I have developed no social life. I spent so much of my time and effort caring for them when they were truly struggling and I pushed myself aside. I turned down many opportunities to grow a social life, so much so that I still feel like the new kid that just moved. I still have the anxiety of feeling like I have to talk to my friend whenever they want to and I have lost touch with what would make me happy. The career path I have chosen for myself just feels like a burden and I no longer am excited about life. I just feel that whatever I am doing I am just doing it because I have to. Life just feels meaningless.

Also, please note that these events were well over 6 months ago. I didn’t want to do anything while I was angry.

I started working part-time for a soap production plant in Arizona on 6/1/2021, where my prestigious title was ‘Soap Packer’.

(It should be noted that I worked here with my GF, and someone in her family owns the company. But they didn’t know each other before she started working there 6 months before me.)

When I got there I immediately noticed many holes in their production flow, as well as their production tracking. I brought up my concerns lightly, and they said that they were working on tweaking everything. I left it at that. I didn’t want to pester them if they were already working on it. However, weeks went by and nothing changed. I eventually got frustrated, went home after my shift, and started using Google AppSheet to build a prototype application that will track the pack department’s production, off the clock of course. After it was built, I showed my bosses and they said that they would want to do a test run before they bothered implementing it. So in the next two weeks, I start staying longer hours to make changes once people are gone for the day. Switching things around to make production flow better. Once these changes were made, production started picking up, and they can see the numbers of every worker individually. This is more reporting than they ever had. Most of their internal documentation was on loose paper that may or may not get filed somewhere.

 For this reason, they started to ask me for new features on the fly and would allow me a few hours a week to work on the app on the clock. After a few weeks of this, they told me to stop using the computer at work and to remember that I am a packer.Honestly, that was okay to me because they were right, I was a packer. So I decided to give packing all I got!

 I became a pretty fast packer. I would always do about 2.8-3k bars a day, while the average was close to 2200. I enjoyed my work and did it well. I also never stopped trying to help my department find solutions to problems they were facing. That is until October of that year.

On 10/14/21 my friend and I were both laid off. We signed a paper stating we acknowledge the fact that we were terminated. Needless to say, I was hurt. I was one of the best workers in my department, and certainly, the one who cared the most. But I understood that it was just what needed to happen. They claimed that they were laying off all part-time employees.

I went home upset, and eventually, my GF got home and comforted me. I explained what happened and she was furious.She worked very closely with the owners and come the next day the owners could tell they had messed up. She didn’t do anything vindictive, simply didn’t lie to them when they asked “Is everything okay?”

The long short of it is that they claimed that at the time of termination they offered me a full-time position and I refused. My boss specifically told my GF that the company offered a full-time position to all part-time employees. Both my friend nor I were not extended this offer. 

After saying all of that to my GF they called me in a few days later and offered me a full-time position. When I asked them if my friend could have his position full time too, the HR rep shook her head no. when I asked “Why not? I was told all part-time workers were offered this.” She just looked at me and shrugged. I declined the full-time offer at this point since this whole place stank to me, but eventually, they decided that we could both have our jobs. (NOTE: We never signed anything to become re-employed but we did sign something to say we were terminated.)

Now we are in the last two months of 2021, and I am trying extra hard to try and be faster and faster in my packing position. Eventually, I get to the point where I can pack 5000 in one day. I even did 10300 in two days! When my manager vouched for me and said that I had been doing the work of two people every single day, guess how I was rewarded! A hat! Not even a hat from MY BOSS. My boss told their client how amazing I was in a meeting, and the client sent me a hat.

 Now that I think of it, they technically did surprise me! Not even three weeks later they hired a new “Chief Marketing Officer” who was posed to make a 3-figure salary and own a stake in the company. In a later meeting where this hire came up, they talked to me about all the things he promised to do for them, and how he claimed he would go about it. TBH I could see through this guy by what they were telling me about him.

He made a lot of claims about the team he was going to hire to run a Shopify store (this makes no sense as we are a smaller company and one man could do it easily.) As well as a few other claims that seemed wildly unorthodox in the tech world. 

Now, this guy comes in and immediately doesn’t like me. My bosses asked me to show him the app I built and explained what Appsheet was. All he had to say was “This doesn’t look scalable.”And I showed him how it could scale infinitely and could be pretty easy to convert to a SQL DB. To which he replied, “Where is your staging area?” (I'm gonna stop this tangent here but looking back I realize he had no idea what he was talking about and was just saying buzzwords to me.

The only reason I bring him up and go into that last paragraph is that only two weeks after that I am called into his office, where he has HR waiting. He tells me to hand over all of my credentials to the App I built on AppSheet and tells me they no longer belong to me and that if I refused the company will sue me. I obliged and emailed the credentials to my boss. I lost access to the app until the day came when they fired the marketing manager for taking advantage of the company and basically stealing (Y’all shoulda have seen the Shopify store that he ‘needed one more week on’ for 2 months. It was a template with a fake snowing add-on.)

Once he was let go my bosses asked me to make their Shopify store. I was told I would be working at my Packer rate while I proved that I could build a Shopify store. In hindsight, this was stupid, because I built a whole app months before that was much more challenging than the storefront. Anyway, I finished the first website by late December (started on the 10th of Dec) and got a call in the same week from my boss promising that I would be bumped up to 25-30$ an hour and given a 2000$ bonus. I did get the bonus, never got the raise!

Fast forward to February. I asked for the raise as it had been two months and five days since I started working on the website. When I did this math in my head I got mad and emailed them. I explained that I was being taken advantage of at this point and would like the raise I was promised by my boss. At this point, they tell me that they would get back to me in one week. So what did I do? I didn’t work for a week. I wasn’t going to be taken advantage of and I made that clear to them. When they finally got around to talking to me about my raise, it was TWO weeks later and they told me “most people don’t stop working when they want a raise.” To which I replied, “Most people don’t do work for half their pay grade.”

I explained that to continue my work in these two weeks would mean that I would finish the website and they would have what they wanted from me, for half of what they promised me. They took this opportunity to ‘demote’ me to a packer. ( I never got promoted or signed anything saying I was anything else.)

At this point, I drove to the facility to give them a piece of my mind and they finally offered me my raise from 16/hr to 30/hr.

WOOHOO!!!!

But then stopped giving me any work at all and refused to let me come in to pack for my old wage. I think I clocked MAYBE 10 hours at that new rate.

AWWWW!!!

They then stopped replying to my emails asking for their OK on designs, then they stopped giving me work altogether, then they silently fired me 3 weeks later. I only found out I was fired when I tried to enter the building and my unique code didn't work. So there it is, sorry it’s so long.

 I don’t know what I’m looking for by posting this. I mostly just wanted to whine. These events really messed me up a bit. Had to un-learn “Work hard, get screwed.” over the last year.

TLDR: My bosses took advantage of me ANY chance they got. Hard work got me nothing more than a weekly therapist meeting. Coast like ya means it, folks.

I would play NBA hangtime whenever I wasn't studying or in class. It wasn't so much me playing the game but rather my reactions, win or lose, that gave me the moniker ""Hangtime Kid"" from a bunch of the upperclassmen.

When I won:

* Standing on top of the machine, arms raised in triumph
* Distributing chest bumps like they were free candy
* Occasionally humping the machine

* Screaming and cursing
* Throwing chairs
* Attempting to topple the arcade cabinet
* Banging the machine
* One time it was brought to my attention by a student the next day that I had broken a pool cue on the machine. I have no recollection of that, I literally blacked out during that rage

I called him and he said he would go, so I went ahead and bought a second ticket when getting my own. I later sent him the link of the concert details and we briefly texted about how this is going to be a fun concert and how excited we were to go.

Fast forward to about 2 weeks prior to the concert, I was on Instagram and saw in the comments of his post that he was saying how he will be going to see The 1975. I was curious to see when they were going to be playing in town and low and behold it’s the same day as the concert I wanted to go to. Between this point and the invite, I never got any message from him saying he wanted to go see them and that it conflicted or anything. I then messaged him asking if he still wanted to go to the concert with me and he responded that “he doesn’t think he can go”, but never acknowledged the fact or said sorry that he made a mistake.

The concerts were last night and I had a good time at mine. I was still able to go with another friend. I saw on social media that he went to his concert with his main group of friends. They are all very close and have been for a long time. Another fact is that I used to be, and still sort of am, in this group, but became not really close anymore after moving states in high school and being away for so many years. I’ve since moved back, but everything has changed. It sucks because I’ve know this friend since elementary school and have been his friend longer than anyone in the group (to be clear I don’t blame anyone else in the group).

Is started with my ex (who was also a doctor) cooking up some date rape shit about me. I got framed for it, I tried to explain it to my med school, they basically kicked me out, and then she changed her story up a whole bunch saying she didn’t think that happened anymore.

When did it become so ""wrong"" to look at fictional female characters and have them be sexy?

I find more men complaining about this than women, and I can't comprehend that at all. I've seen more and more women come out and say that they loved the characters they grew up with that were greatly sexualized: Bayonetta, Lara Croft, Jill Valentine, Samus, etc. When did people, men specifically, become so against looking at sexy fictional women?

Asking us to not find women sexy is like asking us to not be horny. And if you know how humans work, that's impossible. People want men to stop sexualizing women, but I have a better alternative: let women sexualize us and we won't say a damn thing.

Sorry for the long ramble and not well-worded writing. English isn't my first language.

I(29F) met this guy(27M) on a dating app right after he got deployed here. We were talking and hitting off really well, and that led us to talking on Discord and other messenger. We facetimed, and voice chatted in front of our laptops, for so many hours over beers. Since he was in quarantine, we chatted a lot before we actually saw each other. We liked the same games, had similar interest in things(he almost liked anything I like.. weirdly enough) so we have played few games together. It was really nice to actually engage in a talk about what I like in a very passionate way - not just a game but music and everything. I did not have that kind of connection much in the relationship I had before.

Anyway, few days later(about 10 days after I first started talking to him) he is around my town. He asks me if I want to have dinner together. I went out and we, like we did on the chat (voice + video chat), hit off really well and have an amazing time. He drove me back home. He was being really sweet to me the whole time, and giving me some lovely nicknames that would make me think we're in a romantic relationship. I was in a relationship with few Americans before and by that experience and the culture I know of, it's not so common to have a nickname for someone unless they're like in a relationship. That way, I felt like I was really special for him. He texts me day and night, and if I want to, we play games together too. Few days after that, I invited him to my place and we had sex for the first time, which was amazing. I get physically more attracted to people when I have a great chemistry with the person, so it was super awesome.  
Few more days go by, and we hang out. The whole time we've been hanging out, we're out in the street, holding hands and all. He wraps his arm around me, and gets all sweet and nice. We just constantly laugh, and enjoy our drinks at the bar, and he seems absolutely happy like I am. Things can't go any worse than this, and I feel so dreamy to be in such a thing.  
We come back home together, another night gets spend again, and I am all smitten. Just anywhere we go we hold hands and have a good conversation. We had lunch together, I saw him to the subway, and he went back. But that night, all of a sudden he confronts me that he has 'no romantical feeling' towards me. What he had been doing so far was just most caring and loving way, even it was more than my long term ex-boyfriend did. I just had no idea why, and he kept telling me it was not my fault, but he just didn't feel the connection. I got flabbergasted because every time I say something I like, he was always like ""oh my goodness, that's amazing cause I love that stuff too"". We even confronted our feelings to each other, I told him I like him and I am not looking for something that's just going to end as one night stand or a short period of relationship, and he totally understands and says he won't ghost me and he will tell me.  
Eventually I was so heartbroken and spend the night sobbing, but I try to put myself together. He texts me like there has been nothing bad going on. He keeps saying he still wants to be a friend with me, and he genuinely think I am cool and all. That was like sprinkling salt to my wound, but I try to shake it off and move on... I like him too so I was thinking I could be friends after my emotional damage is repaired.

However I kept feeling that something is not right. I had this strange gut feeling, but I tried to dismiss since I sometimes get anxiety. But I just could not stop myself and googled his names. Apparently it seemed like he has a wife, or he used to. I was not sure but just feeling like he would be lying to me.  
So after figuring it out, I texted the woman, just to make sure if he is divorced with her, or she knows about what is going on. I told her where and how I met him. She was rather in a very displeased tone, saying it is all okay. There is no words saying they are divorced. Since then I ask him and he already knows I contacted her, because she texts him and is not so pleased with me telling her about it(which I do not quite understand, because I meant it in a way to prevent both of us being cheated on).  
After that, he finally confronts me that he was never divorced. They are married still. And I hear it the first time today, after I became a detective and researching online for hours.  
Now, he is saying he is in poly. His wife has texted me and told me that she asked him to change the description on the dating profile to stop the confusion..

At this point, I am really angry and frustrated. He could have told me earlier, and be upfront about being polyamorous. Just this whole thing makes me think that I was basically cheated on by him, by not telling me the truth about himself. Also, just the way how his wife said made me think that she doesn't even want to use the word 'polyamorous' not like he claims to be.

After all this, I don't know what to do to better up my emotional damage. I cannot sleep and eat cause I am in so much anger. I feel like I was betrayed, and everything hits me harder than anytime before, since I was never so open about myself to someone in a while ever since my ex boyfriend. I feel so frustrated, that I barely managed to find someone that emotionally connects so well this time, and that person was just using me and not being genuine with me. I had this long trauma from my previous relationship, which my ex boyfriend has brought a girl to his house while I was gone, and lied about it using another person for his story.

What should I do to move on with it? and the more I think about it, in the corner of my head, I feel like I am someone who did not become generous enough for the guy. I just can't even see the line where I could be respected and it is just going all over my head. What can I do? I can't even sleep from being so angry. Help.

I can't focus at work, and all the people looks disgusting, and just something that ever slightly reminds me of him gets me stressed/depressed.

Another story goes like this. We had some important training coming up. As I was planning it, I wanted to have a mockup to train as close to the job as possible. I brought this up in a meeting and said I could build it. one of the engineers said that there already was one that was built for tool testing years ago but it was stored at a different site. Emails were sent and I ended up traveling to that site to inspect and claim it but when I got there they showed me something different. There had been some confusion and the old mockup had been scrapped. At the next meeting I showed drawings of what I wanted to build since the other option was no longer available. Everyone liked the idea. My manager kind of mumbled a go ahead. With 8 people sitting on this meeting I said ""I just want to clarify that I am to proceed with this proposed construction, is this correct?"" She said yes. That day I took my drawings to our carpenters and started ordering materials. I am also a bit of a maker so I was able to make some components at home in my shop and banked some hours for the time. (There will be more on this in another story) By the next weeks meeting it was starting to look amazing. I brought a bunch of photos to show it off. I proudly passed a few printed out photos to my manager who looked at it, scoffed and asked who authorized me to do this? I said ""you did, one week ago sitting in the same chair you are right now. I even asked for clarification!"" She looked like she was going to deny it but saw everyone else nodding their heads in agreement with me. She started to complain that she didn't know what it was going to look like and it was going to cost too much money. I pointed to her notebook and said ""I can see the drawings I gave you last week hanging out of your book, so you know what it was going to entail"". As for the cost, the carpenters had a lot of material already on hand. We only had to order about $130.00 of extra stuff. (Keep in mind this is for a job worth hundreds of millions of dollars). She huffed and puffed and for the next few weeks she kept making underhanded comments about how I was wasting money and time on a worthless project. When it was finished people were amazed.

He expressed that it’s hard for him to switch from work mode to sex mode during the day. That was understandable so I stopped sending him my horny thoughts during the day (which were quite tame if you ask me). But as the relationship progresses, it seems that there is NEVER a time for me to bring up sex unless we are both in the same room and are horny. I recently texted him about his opinion on a sex toy that I would want to try with him. This was at nighttime so he wouldn’t have been working. He got all weird about it and said that he wouldn’t be able to give an honest answer because he’s not horny and that the timing is off. I don’t know why but this bothered me because I specifically waited until night so that there wouldn’t be an issue. It seems that I just can’t bring up sex around him unless he is horny.

TL;DR I applied to two jobs, the one that offered me a position first called my (then) boss and asked if he was ok if they extended their offer.  I accepted while I waited for the other (and preferred) company's offer.

Great news, the Preferred Opportunity offered me a position.  The first month was good, but then my (actually excellent) manager had a dream opportunity elsewhere and they wisely took it.  Since then, things have gotten unmanageable - five people have left or given notice in the last two weeks.  Someone on my team gave notice and they were fired off-hours by phone.  The others get to work out their 2 weeks.

I think management has begun to suspect people aren't happy here (lol).  We had a meeting yesterday where it started out sounding like they were going to take accountability, but they promptly turned it around in the wildest episode of the SpinZone I've ever seen.  Among the points:

""I think about the people we've lost, and I just feel sad for them.  Their shortsightedness kept them from seeing what they could be a part of.""

""I think people just get into this emotional frame of mind when facing \[the volume problem\], but honestly, this job isn't that hard.""  This was just after confirming that we have less than 20 adjusters and a pending caseload of 2500 growing every day, while having to maintain an open phone line.

""We really appreciate the hard work you guys are doing!""

""Everything you do on a file has a trickle-down effect on the customers.""  Not said in any way that implicates this also applies to management.

But don't worry, guys!  They just hired **TWO** new adjusters.  And the claims left behind by all these people who are just too shortsighted to see the potential greatness?  The managers are kindly taking those after ""much consideration.""

I (F18) have been dating my girlfriend (F19) for three years, four at the end of the year. We’ve had a really happy relationship aside from a few bumps and she is a lovely person to have spent my high school years with. 

Something that’s been an issue for me lately is her very poorly covered jealousy whenever I hang out with friends or sometimes my sibling (NB21). I feel obligated to give a warning ahead of time before I make plans with friends. If she doesn’t like them she will talk shit on them constantly, either to me or her sisters (which she tells me). She’ll criticize them on aspects of their personality and our friendship, or even stupid things like their names or voices. Whenever I’m not at home or i’m not out with family, if she contacts me it’s VERY clear she’s upset. She gives short responses or ignores me or otherwise makes it clear she’s upset. 

In the past and somewhat recently, fights (or situations where I need to respond ASAP) have been picked when I’m not home/not busy and can’t properly respond. Conflicts that I feel like she knows will specifically upset me. Recently, I went to a music based leadership camp and the entire time I was gone (she couldn’t come with) she made rude comments about the friends I was with, directly expressed her jealousy of me being there (which I don’t really blame her for, but still) and other things which proceeded to dampen the fun I had. 

During all of these events I feel obligated to constantly check my phone, and it’s tiring. Once in our freshman year, I had been staying at my best friend of 10+ years’ house and she had texted me asking upsetting questions about the fate of our relationship which I came to find out was out of jealousy. It made me break down in my friends bathroom and ruined that night of my stay and affected the rest of the trip.

Whenever I even talk of friends more than in a passing way, her tone shifts. She even made a post on Reddit within the past few weeks expressing how she felt insecure whenever I hung out with others. I have, to my knowledge and as far as she says, never given her a reason to be insecure with that aspect of our relationship. Neither of us have been cheated on, I’ve never flirted with other people nor expressed interest in anyone aside from in a platonic sense. I don’t know how I can talk to her about this and tell her how upsetting it is to me. I talked to my sibling about this and they told me it was strange and controlling. I don’t know if controlling is the correct word nor if it’s true, but I feel bad about all of it. I don’t know if it’s impacted by the fact she doesn’t have a lot of people to hang out with aside from me, but I don’t get how that should be something I need to be punished for. This was really long and I’m sorry, but I’d like some insight or something. Thanks.

TL;DR: My girlfriend gets jealous when I hang out with anyone else aside from her and talks poorly on my friends when upset. Sibling says it’s controlling.",relationship_advice,My girlfriend gets jealous when I hang out with anyone aside from her,1.5,2022-07-22

i (19nb) am in a horrible relationship with my partner (20m). to start at the beginnings, earlier this year i was in a very happy, somewhat new relationship with my partner. we were a couple months in, fully exclusive, had said i love yous at this point. 

when we were hanging out, i noticed that while he was on his phone he swiped past the grindr app. i got nosy and went through his phone that night while he was asleep, and I found out that not only was he talking to and sending nudes with many people on grindr, many of his female friends that he had told me not to worry about were sending him nudes and talking to him. there was a girl that he had swiped up on her story and said ""youre so hot ily marry me."" there was a time that he had me go pick up groceries for him so he could ""study more"" and while i was gone he facetimed one of his hoes. he facetimed someone in the shower multiple times, had like 6 hoes that he talked to the same way he talked to me, but he never hooked up with any of them. i scrolled far enough back to see that he was also cheating on his last girlfriend. 

I eventually decided that he needed to know that I knew about his sexuality and I came clean. there was a lot of turmoil when it happened, and afterwards i was still left with a lot of anxiety about him cheating on me. 2 weeks ago, i went back through his phone and found him talking to many men on a site similar to grindr, and calling many of them on whatsapp. i confronted him about it and he apologized profusely, saying it would never happen again. 

Last week, i went to turn the alarm off his phone in the morning and i swipe up to look at his notifications, and when i did i saw a message from a girl that he hadn't mentioned. i clicked on it and unlocked his phone, and it had disappeared. in the notifications it said it was from that night, so he must've deleted it right in front of me. 

I dm'd the girl on instagram immediately after, and her and i became friends and she showed me what the texts between them that had been deleted were. in those texts, he had called me controlling and insane, and talked about how hard it is to leave a controlling relationship without mentioning anything that he did. also on his phone i was able to do a stalking trick i saw on tiktok to see if he's deleted messages and he did with his ex, who is the one person i didn't make him tell we were together because i didn't want to rub it in her face. he had also called someone on whatsapp again , and was calling one of his female friends every day and lying to me about it. 


i haven't told him about any of this and I think when I do he'll end it, he talks a lot about how he's scared my trust is broken beyond repair... and if i'm being honest it might be. I love him too much to bring myself to tell him or to end things myself, and i don't know what to do. any thoughts?

edit: He's my best friend, i've never met anyone that i connect with in the same way as him, no one that i've ever had so many shared interests and passions, no one that's understood me this way",TrueOffMyChest,i have a horrible relationship but i can't leave,1.0,2022-07-22

The TIFU:
I've just moved in to a little house on the outside of town. We don't have curtains yet and done stuff are still in boxes.

There's not a lot of movement here except for the construction of a house of a neighbor I haven't met yet... While I guess they've already met me.

I pooped (like a lady) and after light wiping I decided I was going to take a shower so I could be spotless clean (like a lady). Before that, I remembered I had to charge my phone and could use the few extra minutes so I came out of the bathroom without pants and run to my room, where the big window has a good view of the highway and neighbors that weren't there (they could have seen my lady parts, as I'm a lady).

So I do a turn to go back to the bathroom and before I get there I see them, the construction and persons constructing it. And I guess my neighbors too...

My sister (31F) and her husband conceived just a little while after our surrogate did. I thought this would be an opportunity for us to bond. I’ve loved getting to pick out nursery decorations and baby clothes for my son and have always picked up a few things for my sister anytime I can.

My sister has had some unpleasant pregnancy symptoms and complains about these often. The complaints don’t necessarily bother me, but I try to always remind her how worth it it is. Sometimes it seems like she’s not excited at all, which I just can’t relate to in the slightest.

Earlier today she was talking about how sore her back and ankles are, and I reminded her that she’ll have a baby in her arms in January and she should focus on that to get her through. She snapped at me that I will never understand what she’s going through and that just because we’re having a baby around the same time doesn’t mean I should try to “relate to a woman’s struggles.”

When I turned 12, I went through puberty during the summer and went from 5’3 and 169 pounds to 5’9 and the same weight. My body evened out and I was “skinny” as to what everyone told me. My friends didn’t really treat me different than, but now that we are all in our 20’s I have noticed they seem different. 

If I invite them to a pool, they say no and wait until I’m busy to go. If I ask to hang out they find some reason we can’t, but always hang out together. I have brought it up multiple times and they all say there is nothing wrong and they don’t treat me different. I understand some people are closer than other, but I feel completely excluded from them. It’s also not like I did something because they will constantly say something like “only fat girls would understand.” Or “you’re too skinny to notice.” 

Recently I voiced that I was tired of being left out and that I feel like they have made me an outcast in our friend group for no reason after again another hang out I was left out of. The group said it’s not like that, but I feel very left out.

We have moved in together, then we moved states with each other,  and now we live in our dream house with our best friends as roommates.  My partner helps me in so many ways and is genuinely a very sweet person.  I care about my partner immensely and it hurts me tremendously even thinking about this.  I want our relationship to work out.

When my partner is in a bad mood they take it out on me.  If I let’s say forget to take out the trash they might make passive aggressive comments about how I don’t do anything (even though I do a lot if not most of the housework) or they might start screaming and throwing things around me. They struggle a lot with their mental health and they’ll have these mood swings that I never remotely expect.  They have threatened to break up with me so many times that we’ve agreed that I just shouldn’t take them seriously when they bring it up.  They’ve also told me many times that they would probably kill themself if we broke up.  

Once they said that they might kill themself and that it’s over between us and they ran out of the house and drove away.  It totally broke me at that moment I really thought this time they were going to die.  I lost my sister to suicide and I didn’t want it to happen again.  I called emergency services and tried everything I could to find them.  When they came back they told me that I deserved to think that they were going to die because I made them feel that way.  They were also mad that I contacted people.

Our relationship didn’t start out like that.  My boundaries have been gradually pushed to the point were it feels like anything could happen.  The first time they screamed at me like that I left the house, then they went after me to apologize and beg me to stay and said it wouldn’t happen again.  And eventually that kind of yelling was normal.  Every time that I genuinely think that they are going to die or genuinely think that they are going to break up I care just a little bit less.  I don’t want to feel that way but I think it’s impossible not to.  That’s what tears me apart.

Things haven’t been as bad lately with us because things are just going well for us right now.  There’s still passive aggressive comments and occasional put downs but for every one of those there are at least 10 sweet things things they say that just melt my heart.  But I’m afraid that when things get bad again it’ll be worse than before.

My partner and I both want to have a family in our future, but I don’t know if I want that anymore.  I grew up in a house with lots of yelling and it really bothers me on a core level.

I don’t even know how we could break up anymore.  Our lives are so tangled and I can’t financially handle moving right now.

In the school vehicles, they’re 15k (brand new) Japanese cars - no biggie. BUT she has to take the test in my car (her daily driver).

My car is a brand new BMW M series and every part costs a LOT of money. She’s driven and owned very expensive cars - that’s not a concern to me, she’s an experienced driver. 

My problem. I’ve been letting her drive a little to get her comfortable with the car and I’m pretty easy going. I’ll say, ‘you’re drifting, drifting DRIFTING’ if she doesn’t correct. Like, it’s logical right?

2022-09-12 02:46:11,1,False,1," I (20m) have been friends with Jenny (20f) on and off since middle school. We never had much in common besides the fact that we were both semi-outcasts. Not bullied or anything, we were never exactly fighting off people to be friends with. Friends out of convenience, but friends nonetheless. If we were in the same class or lunch period we would sit with each other, but we rarely hung out outside of that. We graduated spring 2020, went to different colleges in different towns, and since then I’ve seen her just once in summer 2021. Still, we would sometimes text outside of that.

I was okay with drifting apart to be honest, I’ve gone months without talking to my other friend from High School. We just message occasionally if we’re in town or something happens with an interest we have in common. It happens, we just went in different directions. However, Jenny was really trying to keep the friendship and communication going. I get it and there’s nothing wrong with that in the slightest. However, she would go about this by texting me “Hey”. Nothing more than that to start a conversation. Ever.

For the first year-ish, I would always respond with a “hey” or a “what’s up” in return, figuring she actually had something to say when she would message. But she would always say “How have you been” or “nothing much” in return. The conversation would quickly fizzle out and would just emotionally drain me. Why message if you don’t have anything to say? Also, why message “hey”? We’ve known each other since middle school, surely we are past the point where we greet each other. Plus it’s near impossible to start a conversation like that.

Anyways, this went on for over a year. I know it sounds like an exaggeration but it’s really not. Over and over again until it got to the point where I started avoiding her messages. Fun fact about me, I have pretty bad ADHD, and when things are out of sight, they are completely out of mind. I fell into this vicious cycle of avoiding, then forgetting, finding the text later, feeling guilty, and then avoiding it because I had already avoided it and it was awkward and it had been a week or more and I felt even more guilty. I know it’s not right, Jenny is super kind and sweet and never did anything to deserve being ghosted. I didn’t intend to ghost her. But that’s what happened.

It’s been a year now that I haven’t messaged her and it eats me up. She still messages me “hey” occasionally, and last month she sent me a paragraph asking if she did anything wrong, near begging for an explanation. Funnily enough, that was the one text I felt immediately compelled to answer because it was actually something I could respond to instead of a fucking “hey”!

I didn’t though. How can I just start messaging after a year of radio silence? After I've been such a shitty friend? I didn’t even attempt to communicate my issue before this all happened. I know I’m capable of explaining, apologizing, and groveling for forgiveness, and hell Jenny would probably forgive me (not that I’m sure I deserve to be forgiven). Either way it would be up to her if the friendship continues, as I am completely in the wrong. But if she would like to be friends again, I don’t know how to express that I am going to go nuts if she keeps texting me “hey”. I don’t want to blame her or make it sound like she’s at fault, but I know the cycle will repeat and me apologizing doesn’t actually address the problem unless I want to suck it up and get “hey”s for the rest of my life.

I think I should reach out, for closure for the both of us. How should I handle that conversation, if I should even have one? Should I be aiming to be her friend again or should I just apologize and let us both move on? How can I move forward from here?

2022-09-25 11:51:36,6,False,1,"Dear Reddit, please give me your take. For better context, his mom is a sociopath and has very very little empathy and scoffs at mental health privately but is this amazing person that is extremely intelligent, just doesn’t know what empathy is truly and doesn’t understand it. 

And therefore, from his mother’s perspective, I wanted to be viewed without my mental illnesses at the forefront because to her they are silly. He has his own that he deals with but i wanted to keep mine private from her. This was my first time meeting her and to make matters worse, apparently he lied about how we met to her and I’m trying to keep his stories straight so I’ve got a ton of extra anxiety about that stuff-trying not to make him look bad. 

And then he calls me later (they left together to go on a hiking trip) I’m on speakerphone and his mom is in the room and he asks me, “see that wasn’t bad, right?” 
What a candid and weird question to ask me… even if it went badly-anyone with enough brains trying to stay on a parent’s good side would say “of course it went well.” That was just weird and a big clue that he told her how scared I had been to meet her. (I had contemplated taking an anxiety med because it was close to me having a panic attack.) 

I can’t tell if he’s trying to embarrass me or not because before we left our apartment and they went on their hiking trip he asked me if I had my own keys to my own apartment in front of her. And I thought that that was a really stupid question. Of course I have my own keys, I lived at this place far before he had moved in….? It was just ODD. 

I can’t talk to him about this because he is currently hiking for six days so I won’t even hear from him but I was wondering if maybe you guys might know why he acted this way or have ideas?

When I was 12 I was given a journal from someone in a church I used to go to. Around the time I actually started writing in it, was when my guardian became emotionally abusive, I needed somewhere to vent about what happened every day, somewhere private. My journal was the best place for this, so to keep people away from it, the first few pages were just empty threats. Stuff like “If you read this I’m gonna kill you.” A normal person probably wouldn’t take this seriously, especially since I was a literal child.

One day after I had gotten in trouble for something (I don’t remember what it was), my guardian said to me, “THATS IT. IM CALLING YOUR PARENTS AND MAKING THEM TAKE YOU BACK!” (The reason I was not with my parents is because they couldn’t take care of me, so my grandmother took care of me, but she died, so I was with a friend of hers) so one day after a month that happened, she decided to pack up my stuff while I was an after school program. When I got home she said absolutely nothing, my journal was also missing, but I didn’t think anything about it. The next day I had a doctors appointment, and she had my journal. She showed EVERYTHING to my docter, she felt threatened by something a LITERAL CHILD wrote. A few hours later, I was at the emergency room for a psychological exam. I was almost sent to a mental hospital for something that would have never been taken seriously by anyone else. After we got home everyone in the house had a lock on their door, and all sharp objects were in a safe. I was put in therapy 4 days a week, All because of some empty threats I wrote as a child.

Growing up if my teachers needed to contact them for anything they would never pick up if they weren’t home because they refused to get cell phone. This was the early days of phones so it was more understandable but now they still refuse to get phones. It’s not because they are against technology but because they are extremely cheap. My dad is a physician and my mom an accountant and they have 4 houses but they refuse to pay for cell phones. I finally gave up and paid for a family plan and add them and got them cell phones which they use all the time (if their call times and data usage is any indication) but they complain constantly about how I’m wasting money and it’s so annoying. After paying for them for 4 years I give up and switch to a personal plan because I’m sick and tired of dealing with them. Then they switch to a call and text $15 a month plan and call me to Google things for them so they can’t have to use data. That phone plan is very cheap so it has insanely poor reception and can’t work outside of city bounds. So annoying! 

My parents really enjoy hiking and last weekend went hiking in a remote spot. I get a call from my grandma who lives with them that they haven’t returned from their day hike and start worrying. I tell her I’ll look for them if they don’t return the night because it’s a 2h drive back home so they could already be on the way. I call them all night but it all gets sent to voicemail. 

The next morning they still haven’t come home and I drive there and see their car still parked. The whole time I have reception but it’s spotty and I eventually see my parents.

I told them if they had a good plan they could just call me to help them but to save a bit of money they put themselves in danger. 

I get blamed for them not having a good cell phone plan because according to them it’s my fault they don’t have a good plan because they won’t pay for one but if I buy it for them they will.

While I understood that my husband felt unloved when he was in another country, 2000 km away from me, I could understand his actions.

I did my best, together with my father to find us a place in this new country, so he could come and we could be together. 

The place we found, is in a good place, but it needs a massive cleaning and declutter. Something that me from hospital cant do.

So I told my husband that we found a place. When he saw the video, he said he doesnt want it. But i explained him that because he doesnt work here, and i cant work either because im sick, this is all we can afford.

Before to get the keys, I asked my husband to come here, so he can be close when we get the keys. He didnt want, because he would have had to sleep at my fathers place, which is small, but atleast he could be here with me. 

So the day for me to get the keys come, and my dad takes me to our new home. I video'd for my husband some things that were there. And he showed a biiiiig interest in alot of stuffs. But I told him that most of the things are old/chinese(as we are latin speakers)/broken/dirty things. I made it clear that I want the home clean so i can get out of hospital.

He was very angry the days before to come saying that ""my dad steals stuff from his home"" , the home he never wanted.

The day has come for him to be here, and all he can think of is what things my dad stole from HIS HOME. He keeps telling me that he needs to vent to a girl that is a bad influence for him.

In all this time I tried to make him understand that those are objects. But he even dared to say that he cares equally for me and the objects from THAT HOME. I stood by himself, even if it was driving me crazy that he kept complaining of his life. I guess I needed to vent. Im very hurt.

Is his behavior too toxic for me? Or am I toxic for him because I dont value the same things as him?

I recently started going to the gym about 3 weeks ago, and I’ve been using this program to help me. Basically, it is an app that helps me work out, and I have a direct line with a personal trainer that can help make changes to diet and workout strategy. I don’t like it very much, since I am new to the gym, I am not getting a 1 on 1 personal experience; some of the activities that I am made to do is way out of my comfort range to do by myself. The personal trainer advertises that he is available 24/7, but he only responds to me at 10am the next day, regardless of what time I message him. It’s just been a terrible experience for me. 

I messaged him yesterday to cancel the plan, as it wasn’t working for me. The cost was $200CAD a month but the more months you do, the cheaper it is. I ended up going with the $160CAD a month for a four-month plan. I offered to just pay the rest of the $200CAD plan which would have been around $50CAD with taxes, but when I got a message this morning, he declined. He told me that I needed to put in my months notice and would have to pay a cancellation fee. 

Here’s the thing is though: I never signed any legal contract with him. Everything was done over email, the only thing he sent me was a questionnaire and a payment plan from Square. I read through every document he sent me, every text message, and nowhere was a legal clause for the service. I didn't even know about the cancellation policy because I wasn't given any documentation. Could I just cancel my credit card and get a new one to avoid this payment? Could I risk the chances of him sending my bill to collections? I just don’t know what to do in this situation. I’m in school and I don’t have an extra $160CAD to just throw around like that, especially for a service that I am unhappy about and won’t be utilizing. 

Any help would be more than appreciated, I want to thank you for reading this, and I hope you have a splendid rest of your day.

My husband (m33) and I (f30) have been together for a little over 2 years and we have a 4 month old baby.

He got a new job right before our son was born. It was a work from home job, paid training, all benefits and a very good pay ($24/hr) compared to what he was used to ($16/hr.) It was great because he got to be at home with us and it was also a big help when/if I needed anything. 

I went back to work about 2 months ago, after being home on maternity leave for 3 months, and we agreed that I’d work 3 days a week so could stay home and share a few days together but also contribute financially. 

About a month ago and a half ago, he told me he felt the job wasn’t for him so he might wait a few weeks before leaving so he would have time to find something else. 

However, after just a few days, he told me he quit the job and when I asked him if he had another one, he said no. I told him that was irresponsable since we have a baby, an apartment and bills to take care of. He got mad at me for saying I wasn’t ‘supportive’ and not to worry because he would eventually get one.  

A few weeks went by and he kept telling me he was looking for something but nothing was coming through so I went back to work full time so we could stay on top of bills. He finally he got a job offer. 

Unfortunately, the job is far from where we live and it’s in the opposite side of town where his mom lives so it’d be a bit complicated taking our son there. I told him that, even though I was very happy for him, I didn’t think logistics were great and that he would spend more money on gas going back and forth so I suggested getting a different job that works better with our situation but he got mad at me and said I couldn’t even let him enjoy the fact that he got hired. 

I absolutely did not mean for him to feel that way, I was just looking at the big picture and trying to make things easier for us by suggesting getting a job that is either remote, hybrid or at least closer to where his mom lives at so he can bring our son with him on his way to work and drop him off. 

I don’t have a car because I rather save money by using public transportation but he said maybe I should ‘compromise’ more and get one or another job (which unfortunately I can’t because of legal reasons).

I’ve been at my job for almost 4 years and I love it, I have great friends and overall people and work environment are really nice. I’m also on my way to a raise and I’m aiming to be the manager.

I don’t want to make him look bad but I have to mention as well that he doesn’t cook or do laundry and brags about taking the trash out every time so, even though I’m going to work full time and he’s been home since he quit, I also have to come home and make dinner plus most of the chores.

2022-10-20 21:46:42,7,False,1,"First, a little background. I am 30 years old (F) and have been taking LSF (French sign language) classes once a week for about a year. There is a 50 year old man there who started taking classes before me. And I have a big crush on him! 

I don't know how it started but now I think about him EVERY day. I wasn't a very good student last year but now? It's changed a lot. Last class I was so happy to sit next to him. Today I ran into him downtown and MY GOD, he was wearing his police uniform. A real treat for the eyes! Ahah

It's an unconventional attraction so Oasked myself some questions. But when I look at men in his age range on the street right now it's weirding me out. I don't find them attractive at all. But I don't know... It's not the same for him. He looks so soft and strong at the same time. Every time I see him, my crush intensifies. 
Today, as I was leaving him after our conversation, I almost said ""Oh you look good in your uniform"" 😂. (At the same time, I now regret not telling him in a joking tone..... Could it have worked as innocent flirting? Or make him uncomfortable?). 

We never really saw each other outside of class. Last year, with the LSF group, we did two gatherings. Usually, we don't have much opportunity to talk during class because not all learners have the same level in LSF even though the atmosphere is good. At the first gathering, I felt that he wanted to talk to me and he asked me what I did for a living, etc. Then there was a second meeting but I don't remember us talking. There were more people from other class. Then I had an event for my work and he was there (I work for deaf people and people with disabilies). He spent a lot of time with me backstage but we didn't really talk. I was stressed and very intimidated to be so close to him. I was uncomfortable because my boyfriend at the time was in the event. He must have thought I was cold (because I was). But then there was a potluck with the people who were taking the LSF course with me and the atmosphere was more relaxed. That's when I learned that he was turning 50 this year. I thought he was younger. I don't know why, but I got the impression that he was embarrassed that one of his friends would say his age. Maybe it was just my imagination. 

Summer came and went, classes started again but I wasn't sure if I wanted to start again because the year before I had missed a lot of classes and I had to change group level because the others were ""moving up"" but I wasn't. I didn't like that. I missed the first few classes. But I ran into this man again at work (1 of the 5 sites we own) with my teacher. And I was so happy to see him again. My teacher too, but him... It fueled my crush like every time I see him. 
The teacher told me that exceptionally I could do the classes with my old group even if I don't have the level. Laughing, I told them ""it looks like you missed me!"". I seemed to see some embarrassment in the man's eyes, but then again... I'm imagining thing. 

Anyway, I don't know how to make him understand subtly (but not too much) that I am interested in him. 
Today, when I met him, we talked a bit. There was a serious accident at my work last week and the police are investigation (It was not oir fault). He told me that he was disappointed because he would have liked to investigate to learn more about the company I work for. I didn't ask him why, but I guess it's because we work with deaf people and he's been to events with us before. I'm hesitant to text him tomorrow and say, ""Hi! It was nice to see you yesterday. I was wonderinf, if you're curious about [my workplace], I'd be happy to show you around during a lunch break or an evening after work once things settle down."". 
It could be a chance to get to know each other without the group around. 

I'm not sure what I want from him. 
In the future I want to have a serious relationship and a child but I don't mind having a little fun after a bad breakup. I don't know what I want with him: a friend to have sex with or potentially a love relationship. But I want something to happen. What is certain is that I like him and it doesn't stop. 

I don't know how to create a relationship outside the group. I'm already intimidated by him and I'm not sure I can get into flirt mode...so I'd like to avoid doing it in front of everyone. Before I get to the flirting stage, I would like to get to know him better. 

PS: if I give him a tour of my work, we can have some alone time. It's very big and I have my own office. 
There are not many people in the evening and if it's during the day, the place is so big that we will have moments alone to talk.

EDIT: I sent him a message this morning about show him around my workplace. He's seen it but he didn't respond yet. I guess he's working and just took a quick look at his phone. If he doesn't respond this evening, it's clear: I bother him. If he says ""OK. Thanks maybe one day in a few weeks."", he is polite and I'm not going to know if he really wants me to actually show him around. If he responds with more than that... 🥵

Hi everyone, thanks for the kinda words and helping me realise the guilt tripping she was putting me through. I know it doesn’t seem like a big deal but It was honestly making my life very stressful.

I took a lot of people’s advice and went to a friend’s mum. She contacted my mum and offered to pay for a baby sitter.

My mum is mad but accepted, she has known this mum for a long time and refusing would be rude I guess? My mum is still hostile to me for “telling on her” for selfish reasons and making my “dear siblings” stay with a stranger for the night but it’s not like I’ll even be out late. My older sister doesn’t know about anything going on and I’d prefer to keep it that way, my mum still hasn’t admitted she’s in the wrong.

I've had feelings for a friend for a few years now. I've already acknowledged that they most likely do not reciprocate the feelings and I should only think of them as a friend and forget pursuing anything romantic with them. But just because I acknowledge it, doesn't make it so these feelings magically disappear. In fact, I'm having a tough time with that.

Any other mention of another guy and I feel myself getting jealous. I was at a party recently and at the end of the night, I was looking for my friends and found a good friend of mine cuddling with the friend I had feelings for in a room. I wish I hadn't seen that.

There's nothing wrong with what my friends were doing. No one knows I have feelings for her. And it's my fault for not doing a better job disassociating a crush from friendship. But I had a hard time sleeping and it's really all I've been thinking about and I feel like crap. My 2 friends weren't ever romantically involved and they could've just been cuddling but it doesn't really matter what they did, more-so how I'm reacting and how I can't really control what I feel.

Now I find myself feeling weird with the friend I found cuddling with her. And even more angry at myself that all this time and I still can't let feelings go. I would literally pay to have my brain think differently.

2022-11-22 20:00:07,8,False,1,"This is a more business-related question, so if that’s not allowed here please let me know where I could post instead. But it has to do with communicating with people so I think I could get some great advice in here.

I do onboarding for “company a” and my customers are other companies who buy .5 million dollar equipment from company a. We have a lot of websites and resources to help these companies run, maintain, and get help for their equipment. I am there to introduce them to all of our resources, add them into our web systems, help them with anything they need to order, assist them with financial questions/invoices and more. 

I always reach out via email to the customers once their equipment has been delivered to their company. There are also sales representatives who are in constant touch with them, and most will let my customers know that I am a great resource. I will follow up with them within two weeks of my initial email to ensure they received it and knew I was available if they need any help. I also keep my program super flexible and it’s all remote, so we can have short or long meetings, weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly, and they can ask me questions through email or during meetings. So I don’t think it’s an issue with them not wanting to commit to something, since I keep it tailored to their availability.

It seems to be split 50/50 where some customers do reach out and take advantage of my service but the other half ignores me until they need something and then will call me multiple times in a row trying to get ahold of me. I don’t always answer as i may be on break, helping other people, or in the middle of working on something important. I have a lot of meetings and that’s why I let customers know it’s important to schedule a block with me so I have that time to dedicate to them. I also try to emphasize the importance of meeting with me proactively to set them up for success, rather than reacting to a last-min emergency when I’m busy with other customers who have actually scheduled ahead with me.

Plus I need to be able to send a meeting invite so they can share their screen with me while I get them acquainted with everything. So I don’t typically like to answer my phone with no context, because they will usually demand my time and want me to walk them through things without sharing their screen which is not as easy or smooth when they don’t know the names of anything yet. I *can* typically guide them through, it just usually takes a lot longer.

Don’t get me wrong, many of my customers are great, put the time and effort in to participate and learn, and they’re always much better off than the customers who ignore me, so obviously I’m doing something right to have at least 50% success. Still, I would like to raise that bar. So if there’s something better I can say to emphasize my points, more professional ways to handle things, or if it’s a lost cause and I’ll just need to suck it up, please let me know!

2022-11-24 17:12:55,108,False,109,"My fiancee and I have been together for almost two years in March.

So there is more to this story than the title suggests. 

A little backstory is that I have a crazy Ex-wife who constantly undermines our relationship with my son. Some of the things she has done: She shows up at his school during my time to make sure he doesn't eat my fiancees food that she makes him, she has told him to purposely wet the bed at my house, she has told him to purposely hurt kids during my time, she has told him that my fiancee is the reason I won't go back to live with her (even though she has a boyfriend and another kid with him). The list goes on and on. We have consulted with my divorce attorney who says that my son should be in therapy, the issue is that where I live a therapist won't see a child without the consent of both parents and both parents participating. Which my ex won't do as she will lose control in that case. The reason she's able to do this is because when we first got separated I agreed to a temporary custody agreement that was supposed to only last from July-December, that was almost a year and a half ago it was supposed to end December 2021. The agreement was in place while I got my living arrangements and settled into a new routine while getting my son used to having split households. But now I'm stuck only seeing him 6 days a month.

With a little backstory you should be able to see the pressure this is putting on my current relationship. It's become so strained at my house every time my son comes over as my ex wife is manipulating my son into being terrible over here. My fiancee and I feel like there's no hope and it has really come to a head this last week. Earlier in the week my fiancee almost called off our relationship she took her ring off and was throwing her stuff on the floor to pack it, I managed to talk her off that ledge but it hasn't gotten any better. This morning (Thanksgiving morning) I woke up and my fiancee was already upset so I cuddled her and talked with her but then she said that she wants to tell my son that Santa isn't real. She thinks this will be a win against my ex wife as it will ruin her lies about who's getting him presents. I told her I wasn't ok with that since he is so young and should enjoy Christmas before being confronted with the truth that there is no magic in the world. This caused another blowout argument that basically ended in an ultimatum (I'm paraphrasing) ""I am going to tell him anyway so either get on board or break up with me and kick me out"". She refuses to change her mind with an argument that is basically ""my dad told me at 6 and I respect him for it."" I am a little more of a distant parent as that's just my personality but I feel like that even if I am more distant my wishes for my son should be respected and ruining a child's Christmas to get back at someone just isn't right. I just can't stand such an ultimatum of doing it my way or getting rid of me, this is making me choose between what I think is best for my son and my future wife.

She is a wonderful step-mother otherwise she is constantly trying to do things with him, teach him, and spend time with him. I don't want to make her out to be a villain as what is going on for so long would break anyone. She has been a wonderful partner even if we've had ups and downs like any relationship. She has been wonderful for my son and is often going out of her way to show him that she cares about him: she makes him fresh cookies, packs him lunch every day he goes to school, helps put him to bed, is helping to teach him to read. Overall she is a great mother.

2022-01-06 00:12:49,3,False,2,"Hi, this is my (22f) first time here, but I need help.
My boyfriend(26m) and I have been together almost three years now, and while he's met my entire (white Canadian) family, we're still just discussing me meeting his (Chinese) parents. We've decided to start by winning over his sister.

Throughout our relationship, we've discovered way, way more cultural differences than I ever expected, but we've managed to overcome them. Probably the biggest so far is his relationship with his older sister (who he lives with), which led to a bit of a faux pas. All my life, siblings have been equals in every way. Their opinions are nothing more than suggestions, they only have authority if they're an adult and you're a child. We're all adults, so when two years ago she told me I had to sleep on the couch and not with him, I asked her why. I was insulted, because I thought she was treating me like a child when she had no right to. She was angry because she expected to be treated like an authority, because she is to my bf. I was effectively banned from their condo. I apologized, somehow that only made her hate me more. It's been over two years, she still doesn't like me, to the point my bf insists I only come around when she's not home.

I don't understand what to do. Before the whole drama, we were getting along really well! I didn't think it'd be a big deal when I asked her why I had to sleep on the couch, and it's frustrating that our good relationship up until then was entirely destroyed by one question. I knew she decided a lot for my bf back then (almost nothing now that he's finished school and works full time) but it didn't occur to me to treat her as a superior. It still feels weird, but cultural differences I guess... 

Any advice for winning over her, or his parents when I meet them? I'm already learning Cantonese.

College was a few years ago and I have since changed my ways. 

I have been dating my current girlfriend for almost 9 months. I am tech support at our company. I met her at her work-from-home install.  I flirted as much as I could during the install, within company policy. She agreed to go out with me. The rest was history. My girlfriend also knows about my old ways, and that I don’t use social media because of it.

Tonight was my girlfriends parents 25th anniversary. It was going to be the first time she introduced me to her family as her official boyfriend. She said it’s a big deal because I am the very first man she had ever brought home.

When we get to her parents place, I start introducing myself to her family. Her younger sister introduced herself to me and hugged me. When she pulled back, she stared at my face. She said “Bruce!?” That’s when I knew I fucked up. You see, my name isn’t Bruce. I used to tell the girls I slept with that my name was Bruce Wayne. I have her a long look, I remembered her. I met her at a rave when I was maybe 20? We had sex in the bathroom, then again in the car, then again at a shitty motel. I remember because I kind of abandoned her at the motel in the middle of the night and stole her iPod mini.

I gave her a pleading look and said that she must be confusing me with someone else.

As we set the table, my girlfriend says hey, this is my older sister and her husband. I turn and nearly swallow my tongue. Her eyes or so big; I knew she remembered me.

I met him the older sister maybe 4 
years ago when I was 22 in Vegas. I was there with my college friends, she was there having a bachelorette party. This was also at a club. She was supposed to be getting married in like 2 days and wanted to have fun. My 3 friends and I had sex with her and her 3 friends. She had the best body, she gave the best head that I’d ever had up to that point. Plus she was athletic, and voracious. I was shooting dust by the morning we went at it so many times.

I felt really bad shaking her husbands hand, while remembering what I had done to his wife. At this point I know I am screwed. I can’t lie to my girlfriend. She knows about my past, just not specifics. 

So a few minutes later we are all eating dinner. I am keeping it together. Cool as a cucumber. Little sister is pounding glasses of red. Giving me the evil eye. Middle sister is looking at me curious. I just shake my head and shrug.

During dinner I ask the older sister to pass me the gravy. We are eating pot roast, mashed potatoes, and greens. She says sure thing Bruce. That’s when all hell broke loose. Little sister jumps out of her seat, spilling red all over the table. She screamed you fucked older sister too!!!  

Everyone at the table at the same time said, TOO!?

She screamed yes! He fucked me. Over and over again. He even stole my ipod. And she tossed a glass of wine at me. 

Older sisters husband got up. He said did you sleep with my wife. I go of course not. He looks at me, then at her. She goes, I told you about what happened honey, we have worked through this. Then he hit me. He had a pretty good right.

I took the hit. I probably deserved that. I did fuck his wife. Now little sister is bawling her eyes out. Older sister has her head in her hands. My girlfriend looks like steam is gonna shoot out of her ears. The dad stands up. He’s like Son, I think you’d better skedaddle.

We worked in different cities but I would travel to her city to meet up with her or whenever she came to our hometown, we would connect and catch up. About half a decade ago, she got really busy with her work and would not respond to my calls or texts, and instead reply back much later (at times after a few days) with a reason that was mostly related to work. I was aware of the extreme working hours of her profession and was understanding of the same. 

A few years ago she got married and then we drifted apart even more. I made several attempts to connect (phone calls, messages, plans to meet in person) but never got anything concrete in return. Also back then I went through a bad phase and would have appreciated her presence but all I got was same reasons (work constraints) as earlier. We only met up once after her marriage and then there was a gap again for 2+ years. 

End of last year she had a child and since then the roles have suddenly reversed. She's trying hard to connect now, calling me, messaging me and asking me to visit her and her child. I recently met her parents and they even reprimanded me on why I wasn't responding to her messages or visiting them. Even my parents have suggested/inquired a few times about this. 

I don't feel the same way about connecting with her, but feel the rest of the family probably think I'm the AH (or being really petty when I tell them the reason). AITA?


Note:

1. Her messages/calls started after the childbirth so clearly that's the reason. No doubts about that.

2022-02-23 23:48:34,3,False,2,"Hi, yesterday I (28F) had a disagreement with my husband (27M) about our workloads being unbalanced (you can see post from my profile for info). And it's clicked that he's been manipulating me.

Yesterday, he said he was staying home to do admin, but didn't. He was on his phone watching videos all morning and does this often. I had my share of the business work to do and really behind on cleaning, as I don't have enough time to do everything.  After asking him twice this morning to help out with something with our puppy and he didn't do it, I knocked on the door, came in and told him I was really feeling overwhelmed and I really need him to contribute to helping out around the house. He closed his eyes and put his head back and didn't say anything at all for a couple of minutes.

I told him that it's not fair to leave me overwhelmed with everything and then shut me out every time I try to discuss it with him. He told me that he can't deal with it and he's not talking about it. I then said, if you aren't willing to discuss it we'll have to talk about it over counselling I suppose. And he snapped and the only thing I remember him saying is ""You don't get to decide if we go to counselling, I'll be the one deciding if I want to talk to a counsellor"". I was taken aback  by how angry he was, I tried to diffuse and said that maybe when I'm not feeling frustrated and he's not feeling frustrated, would he be willing to talk about it and he agreed.

Later last night, he apologised for snapping and said that he felt upset because I barged in (??) and didn't ask if he was okay (???). I could see that was manipulation but didn't know how to to respond, I didn't apologise for asking him if he was okay beforehand (because that's an unreasonable expectation, I was upset over something that's justified and the way I communicated it wasn't disrespectful). 

Then this morning, he said that he thinks that I should apologise to him. I asked him what he thinks I should be apologising to him for, and he said I should apologise to him for storming in the bedroom  and getting upset and not thinking of him. And sleeping on the lounge. 

(This isn't the only time that he's done this during a disagreement (over something he's done). Get upset at me that I didn't ask if he was okay, and try and turn the tables like I am a bad person to bring up something not okay that he did himself.)

I told him that I spoke to him that way because I was feeling overwhelmed and upset and I don't need to apologise for having those feelings, feeling upset is not the same thing as shouting and being disrespectful.

He then told me that he took the time to apologise for yesterday, so I should too. I felt like this was another manipulation tactic and I didn't want to play into it, so I told him that I didn't want to talk to him.

Then later today he called because he needed help with a new bank card, I did, then afterwards I said ""Alrighty then, see you later"". Then he hung up on me without saying goodbye. He's never done that before.

I just married this guy and feeling shocked and scared. I feel like this person is not who I thought he was. I don't know how you can sit on your butt watching videos all day, see your wife working/cleaning from morning to evening, day in and day out including through weekends and not have any sort of empathy or desire to help even the workload? If I saw my loved one in that position, there is no way I wouldn't help them, no matter how tired I was feeling. And the manipulation. He knew before we got married that I hate manipulation with all my heart.

I feel like a switch has flicked inside of me, this isn't the man I thought he was and I don't see him as someone I have a partnership with, he's someone I need to protect my emotional well-being from. 

Proposed action plan:

I know it's best to speak to people in person,  but I feel like he's going to make himself the victim and I'm not going to do a very good job of articulating myself.

I think I should text him and tell him that whether he realises it is not, he has been using manipulation tactics on me. And if he does it again, I will end the conversation and will not have a conversation with him until he can talk to me without using manipulation.

When it comes on the lack of willingness to contribute, after this I think it would be best to separate myself a bit so I'm not relying on him, as I don't trust he has my best interests at heart any more.

I think I should let him deal with the administration side of his own business himself, find my own full time work, then endeavour to split the housework fairly. If he's not willing to contribute to workload/cleaning and I'm working full time, and I am still the only one cleaning/homemaking, then I think he can be responsible for his own mess, clothes, dinners, dishes, etc. to make things more balanced/fair. 

Your advice on how to handle this would be much appreciated.",relationship_advice,I just realised my (28F) husband is a manipulator (27M) and I don't know how to approach it. What to do next??,2.5,2022-02-23

2022-02-23 23:51:12,21,False,7,"my mother and I very recently got back in touch after over a year of not talking . We stopped talking was B/c of her continued controlling behavior towards me into adulthood. We’ve always been at odds b/c of her behavior. Some examples are her consistently insulting my father my entire life. Once when I was 8 she saw that I threw out a small portion of my dinner because I felt ill &amp; she took it out of the trash &amp; put it in my mouth, yelling at me for wasting her money. There’s a lot more I won’t get into.
Fast forward to why I stopped talking to her. I was on her phone plan &amp; car insurance b/c it made it cheaper for her as she’s the only income. Because I was on her phone plan she would get mad if I didn’t respond to her quickly or text her every day &amp; regularly threatened to take my phone off her plan. I would tell her I didn’t have time to visit often (b/c of having multiple jobs and living in a deferent state) but one day a friend from home visited me on my day off while he was visiting family nearby. She found out &amp; threatened to take my car off her insurance because I was “lying about not being able to visit” because I was “using all my PTO for my shitty friends” even though I told her numerous times he was here visiting family &amp; we just grabbed lunch on my one day off that week. I had a piece of mail (important mail) accidentally sent there and when I asked her to send it to me, offering to pay, she said she’d “get it done when she finds time like you do for family”.  I said if she’s busy, could she give it to my brother to mail it and she refused and yelled at him when he went to get it from her. For the next year, even though I got my own phone plan and car insurance and blocked her on everything (due to her randomly sending text to tell me I was horrible and she wished she got a dog instead of having me) she used my brothers phone behind his back to continue sending me those messages. 
Fast forward and i decided to reconnect. She met my fiancé for the first time &amp; is constantly saying how she can’t wait for us to get married &amp; be part of our wedding. The thing is I don’t think I’ll want here there. She has a history of making my accomplishments about her &amp; says how much she’s helped &amp; is to thank for my accomplishments and has a history of confrontation. I don’t want my big day to be ruined by her attitude &amp; don’t want to feel like I’m walking on eggshells around her as I been feeling since we got back in touch. (Side note: my fiancé knows everything about the situation between her &amp; I &amp; we agreed that when we have kids they will under no circumstances be left with her unattended)

2022-03-01 01:25:42,80,False,82,"I bought my own wheelchair because I was unable to participate in events. I have very limited time on my feet, which events/errands/shopping exceed.

Our group wandered a convention space for hours upon hours. I used my chair, my brother with similar issues used a cane.
The others with us suffer from anxiety, but otherwise no other physical ailments (Besides average unfitness)

Because I used my wheelchair, I was able to enjoy the convention, looking at vendors and artists wares, make it to panels, etc. And finally got to focus on the event, rather than my pain. After several hours of convention adventures, I reconvened with my group who I found sitting on the floor.

Friend looked up to me and begged me to let him use my chair because his feet were sore from walking and he wanted to continue looking around the convention. My pain levels were fairly low (2-3) because I'd been using the chair. My brother and I share the chair since we both suffer from the same ailment, so when one starts hurting, the other sits down. Because we couldn't afford two chairs. 
Our friend here doesn't have any medical issue. So, I felt kind of annoyed or offended he asked to use my chair?
He then started talking about how ""we need to get another one"" so that he could use it.

I understand that his feet hurt from hours of walking on the hard floor, anyone's probably would. But, I felt kind of frustrated that he looked to my wheelchair as a convenience that we should all share rather than something that is necessary for me and my brother. And that, if I am not in pain, that he should be able to use it. 
I didn't want my friend to be in pain, so I let him use it since I had rested and would be okay to walk for a bit. He said ""Oh thank God. If you told me No, I would've started crying.""
I do not doubt that he was in pain. But I felt kind of mad that suddenly my chair has become a thing to ""share"".
It is a chair that I paid for, myself. For me and my brother to share. And it feels really frustrating to have to share it to someone that doesn't have any chronic issue especially since I already share it with my brother.
I think anyone should be allowed to use a chair if they're having pain. But part of me is annoyed that he took my chair as an option. Because he probably wouldn't have wanted to ask the convention services to let him borrow one? 

After this event, he's also said things like:
""I'm so glad WE have a wheelchair"" as if he's able to use it when it was purchased for myself and my brother because of our chronic pain issues. 

Am I just being a jerk? By minimizing or making light of my friend's pain from a long day because his issue isn't medical or chronic?

2022-03-07 19:42:52,6,False,6,"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 5 years and living together for the last 3 years. I work a job with relatively normal hours where i go early in the morning and leave late afternoon/early evening, and he goes to work early afternoon and doesn’t come home until around midnight. This schedule has changed a bit post pandemic as he used to work the breakfast shift at his restaurant, but now works dinner as it’s his only option, I understand this is out of his control. 
My boyfriend and I are also both students and do classes online in addition to our busy work schedules, and have 2 dogs as well, so as you can see time is limited already. 

Here’s the issue, we have schedules that allow only for me to see him during the work week right before I leave for work while he is still sleeping, and at 1am when he gets home, to which I always wait for him to get home but usually go to bed fairly soon because I wake up early for work. I understand that during the week this is mostly out of our control. However, I did just figure out he wasn’t being completely honest with me as he did not share that he was getting off work at about 10:30pm every day and he was going out to the bar every night with his friends and coming home way later. This doesn’t bother me horribly, as I respect the need to unwind after work, but I also feel that since time is limited to spend together it seems sneaky and deliberate he didn’t tell me he was getting off so much earlier. 
He comes home and does his homework until 3 or 4am and goes to bed long after me, then sleeps the next day until he needs to go work again. 

On the weekends he does the same, sleeps all day until around 2pm until i force him to wake up, usually gets in the shower and simultaneously thinks up something really important he suddenly has to do, gets dressed, and leaves promising to come back shortly, but most of the time ends up staying out all day, or “running into” a friend and staying out while I stay at home and wait because of the promise he would be back shortly.  Like, I could have been spending time with my own friends but I was prioritizing him so I did not. Not to mention, 9 times out of 10, the friends he’s hanging out with are his coworkers that he’s seeing 40+ hours a week already.

He never prioritizes spending any time with me when time is so limited, when it seems that simply organizing his schedule and maybe not sleeping so much would benefit both parties. Im very frustrated, and I love him a lot, but i’m getting so bored of just sitting by myself and my encouragement to reevaluate his priorities falling on deaf ears. I feel that he does not listen to me and often nods at the things i say without response and even talks over me, usually changing the subject because he is disinterested. How do I move forward?

Severity fluctuates, but recently she has gotten worse to the point where she was fired from her job and my grandma picks up her two young children after work every day to take care of them because D has been hammered day and night. Her partner and my grandparents are obviously not cool with this but are trying more to keep it quiet than get help. Everyone is stressed out in this situation and they already have a lot of other stuff going on from health to financial problems.

2022-05-18 22:29:38,9,False,9,"So long as elections remain free, unions have the potential to be a catalyst for serious political change. Here's how it works:

Unions organize enough that they can successfully run their own politicians for office, starting at the city and county levels. (Also, guys, start running for city and county offices. From there, move up to state positions.) Once union-backed candidates start winning seats, we're in real competition with the oligarchs.

Oligarchs control politicians by making campaign donations. That money funds advertising that gets people elected. Unions already have an infrastructure for disseminating information. Large, well-organized unions can sway thousands of votes with a text message. Churches do this all the time. (If you're religious and pro-labor, consider going to seminary, getting ordained, and taking over a local church. The Bible is crazy left-wing when it comes to economic policy.)

Large enough unions become the king-makers. It's no coincidence that Republican-supported voter fraud has risen in step with pro-union sentiment. The GOP is trying to install a single-party system and getting them out of office is our best hope of preventing that.

Also, consider getting a job in law enforcement. Tired of racist, pro-oligarch cops? Become a cop that is neither.

2022-05-20 00:04:09,4,False,21,"Posting because I can't tell anyone else other than my wife. 

Background: Divorced with two kids.  The relationship started out of high school, with her being a bit of a free spirit to say the least.  Sometime down the line, being young and dumb, I agreed to an open relationship (before we were married).  It seemed like a great idea to the immature, young version of myself, but ultimately there was a gut wrenching feeling I couldn't shake.  Over time, it became more about her and her desires, and my opinions were pushed aside.  

Sometime during this, we decided to have kids (note the young and dumb), so birth control was removed from the equation.  At the same time, she had a regular boy friend that would come by several days a week while I was at work.  It was known that they weren't using any protection, but it was always claimed they were ""careful"".  I was too passive at the time to push the issue.

A couple months later, we find out we are pregnant.  I made a side comment to her once about paternity, but it turned into a fight about trust.  I never brought it up again.  The open relationship ended when the pregnancy began.  Eventually, we got married and had a second child, no real questions on that one.  Not long after the second birth, the open relationship conversation was brought up again, and in spite of me saying no every time it was brought up, the issue was basically forced into a reality.  This resulted in the inevitable divorce within the year.

Fast forward nearly a decade.  My (not so) new wife, the person I was meant to be with all along, and I were discussing having my kids do a genealogy DNA test and compare their results.  She knows my full past and all the details to go along with it.  I expressed the long, suppressed fear I had regarding the paternity of my oldest.  The fear was not whether or not the kid was actually mine, if I was actually worried about that I'd have done a test long ago.  Regardless of DNA, the kid is mine, and would always be mine, and there is nothing that would change how I feel about them.  The fear was that their Ancestry tests would come back and show an anomaly that could upset the entire dynamic of our family, and possibly emotionally destroy a developing young mind.  They have a great life with two families that share their time 50/50, we all get along great (even my ex and current wife get along great).  This is a topic that the kid just isn't mature enough to be able to navigate at this time, and it would destroy the unlimited opportunities they have in front of them.  

We ultimately decided to do a paternity test before we did any Ancestry test.  This would allow my wife and I to solely know the results, and if necessary develop the next steps to how to address the outcome.  We took the samples, mailed them off, and a little over a week later get a notice that they received the test.  Although I was prepared for the ""worst"" and ready to carry the burden for a few more years if necessary, I was still hopeful that DNA would certify the fact the kid is basically a clone of me.  While we were both working (share an office at home) she flags me to turn off my radio, to tell me that with a 99.999% certainty, I cannot deny paternity of the tested individual.

the earliest memory i have is her leaving me in a hot car to buy drugs. 

when i was super super young, she threw my dog in front of me. she’s mentally and verbally abusive and was even physically abusive a couple of times. 

when i was 14-17, we would get into arguments and she would talk about how she wanted hit me, how she just wanted one chance to hit me. 

if i make her mad while she’s driving, she’ll speed. she drives like fucking batman.

my dad and i were going to do a marathon with one of his lady coworkers, but my mom was drunk and accused him of cheating, so we didn’t go.

a few months ago she was drunk yet again and got into an argument with my sister and i. she said, “why did i become a mom?.”

i used to have very long hair. she’d run her hands through it and the feeling of her hands touching me felt like fucking acid. i chopped all of my hair off and then cried because i looked just like her.

she’s gone through some fucked up shit in her life and i know that and i feel sympathy, but she’s never tried to get help. it’s literally all around her, but she just sits on the couch and watches tv.

i have cptsd and most of the trauma is caused by her. last night i decided to research Al Anon. i found quite a few places near me and they’re having a meeting tonight, and i’m going.

my mom denies that she’s an alcoholic, my dad denies that she’s abusive and my sister thinks i’m being a little dramatic, but i don’t care. i have to save myself this time.

2022-06-12 03:09:06,20,False,2,"I’m never this person - worked with kids my whole life and at that behavioral issue kids and “difficult” kids. 

I have a squeaky toy for my dog and I was playing in our side yard with him. My dog is a little barky sometimes, and barked when he first came out of the house but then played quietly chasing the ball I was throwing for him after about twenty seconds max. (Their dogs are outside most of the day and bark every single time my dog walks by, which I’m working on by taking him directly across the street when they’re out so he doesn’t see them and bark back. My dog is never outside alone and I try to apologize if he barks at a human, so it’s not like a my dog issue.) 

Anyways- every time I squeaked or threw the ball, the kids playing next door (who scream, throw their toys into our yard, etc- we never say anything about it because they’re kids and it’s what they do) would whine “oh my god that noise is so annoying!” Or “ugh why are you doing that, STOP IT!!!” 

So at first I stopped for a second and played with a different toy, but my dog wanted that squeaky ball so I squeaked it again and immediately the kids started up again. I had been listening at this point and the kids were not playing with any loud or noisy toys, and while I can’t see through the fence, the timing is incredibly suspect that every time I squeaked the ball they screamed or said something rude. 

This went on for about ten minutes straight and it really got under my skin so I (calmly- I am usually very non confrontational) called over the fence “you know there is someone on the other side of the fence? I’m playing with my dog- you’re being a bit rude”

And the mom starts yelling at me that I was being rude, that I was out of line, etc. she said the kids weren’t talking to me, blah blah- I shut that down by telling her “ma’am I’m not arguing with you through a fence, I’m sorry that I assumed every time I squeaked the ball and your kids screamed it was annoying and I needed to shut up, I thought they were talking to me” and got my dog and went inside. 

We’re a pretty quiet house - my worst offense is sometimes between 5-7 I listen to music at a reasonable low volume outside while I’m grilling on the opposite side of the yard - but tbh, I just don’t want kids screaming at me while I’m playing with my dog. It’s annoying and I feel that, if I ignore their noise 99% of the time, I’d like them and their family to not be rude to me and ignore me should I be making reasonable noise.

I just want to exist quietly, ignore their kids and any of the parties they throw, and play with my dog in my backyard, and now I’m worried I’m that asshole for drawing a line.

I told Haley everything but unfortunately most of you were right. It seems Emily got a bit ""creative"" with the info already.

Haley came over yesterday and when I told her I wanted to talk to her she hit me with ""Is this about what happened on Saturday?"" I froze and was caught off guard but I didn't flinch as I knew I was in the right. She told me she knew something was ""off"" with me so when she talked about it with her friends Emily said ""this is probably about what happened on Saturday"" she didn't go into details and when Haley tried to make her elaborate she just changed the subject and avoided giving details by just telling her ""you know a lot happened, we all got drunk so he had a lot to deal with"" etc. and Haley has been struggling to figure out what Emily meant by that  since Tuesday.

And that just did it for me I felt no remorse for Emily anymore. I didn't care anymore because it is clear she's trying to sabotage my relationship with her FRIEND because well idk why but I blew up and told and showed Haley everything. She asked me why I've agreed to keep this a secret if nothing happened and even if things happened the way I told her they did why would I keep that a secret if she came on to me in such a forward way. I told her that I didn't want to cause her any heartbreak and have been conflicted about this I even showed her this thread and all my posts on here, asking for advice (which is why I still have this throwaway). I gave her my phone so she could see everything on her own so she'd know I wasn't faking anything or trying to spin things in any way. She asked me to text Emily in front of her, acting like I was into her to see how she'd reply. So I did, and things got vulgar within minutes. Haley started crying and told me she had to leave and that she needed time to think. I kept telling her I was sorry I had to do this to her and I apologized for keeping this a secret and kept trying to comfort her but she told me she wanted to leave. She left my apartment yesterday and I was lost I didn't know what's on her mind and I still don't she texted me a few hours after she left here, telling me she's not blaming me for anything and that this was her own fault for excusing Emily's behavior. She thanked me for telling her and that she appreciated the fact I didn't cheat on her when I could have done so right under her nose.

She told me she needed some time to think. She's coming over tonight to talk about us.

2022-06-17 21:32:06,2,False,0,"I (22 f) think that after almost 2 years of being together me boyfriend (23 m)  just doesn’t respect or love me anymore. 
When we started dating he would make so much effort with me eg flowers, nice meals out, trips to different places ect. He even took me on holiday to wales 5 weeks into the relationship. He used to give me a lot of affection such as hand holding, kisses, hugs. I held off a little on sex at the start of our relationship because I wanted him to fall in love with me first. Love making was very fun and passionate with him also very frequent.
Until the last few months. Well some context, I had a bought a house and was having issues we getting the property ready for us to move in quickly. He had started a new job close to where we would be living and was commuting for 90 minutes a day as we were living with my mum in my home town well all the building work was going on in my house. We only had a small double room for ourselves at my mums house with very little space and privacy. He started to become incredibly irritating. He would say stupid things, poke me, make fun of little thing about either me or others and most importantly he just stopped making effort with me. I confronted him on this as I thought it was odd for him and he said it was because he hated living in such a tight messy space with my mum and brother so we took it out on me. 
Move forward to us moving into the house. At first he is really good, helps a lot with cleaning, cooking and finishing odd jobs that need doing. Now when I get home from work, I work later hours and weekends than him, he just sits in my front room watching Netflix in his underwear. He is still equally as annoying (if not worse) that he used to be. He has taken to pinching my stomach recently and saying stupid sayings at the top of his voice. He doesn’t clean anything and if he does I have to ask about 3 times, or if his cooks he leaves everything out for me to wash up. The only thing I can get him to help with is the bins and hoovering, everything else is down to me. The affection is so minimal now, I don’t even get a hug when I finish work. He doesn’t kiss me unless I ask. Our sex has really dried up as well. 
I’m just starting to feel like he doesn’t respect me anymore, I’ve confronted him about all  of this and barely anything changes. Tonight he’s just fallen asleep on the other end of the sofa ignoring me and on his phone.
He has taken up farting a lot as well, which seems strange and is something that he never used to do near me until the last few months. He literally holds a fart and waits for me to walk near him and he even farts in the cat.
I wonder if his is taking to other women or trying to find some one else? We have had issues in the last 6 months with him complementing other girls he has history with over Snapchat. If it is the case I’m scared for the truth.
I love him and I don’t want to lose him, is there anything I could do to get him back?

When I was still in university I had a friend who would take me out drinking on Fridays, Typically we have a few beers but the break just started so we both decided to get blackout drunk, Thats when I ran into one of my moms coworkers (F40s?) at the bar we got to chatting she was remarking how much I'd grown since the last time she saw me, She Invited me to go to her place for an afterparty with her friends. At first I turned her down for some reason that I don't fully remember but after me and my friend got kicked out of the bar we split ways and I don't remember how but I ended up at home in my bed messaging my moms coworker she was saying she'll come pick me up and show me how to party and asked for my address (which I gave her).

I asked her never to tell anyone what happened then deleted my messages with her and blocked her. I was undiagnosed bipolar at the time so I was planning on taking my life over this incident but decided not to because I would have to explain it in my suicide note and be remembered for it.

I've (28f) been seeing a guy (29m) for about a year now, almost to the day. We have been off and on because when we first met he was going through a divorce that he did tell me about at the time. I thought nothing of it and he and I had a pretty good friendship but not anything actually... good? The things we had in common I found out he wasn't actually interested in (I like to read, go to the gym, play videogames, play DND, do homework as I'm in my final year of my Master's, take hikes, visit museums, arcades, and watch cartoons to name some things) all he likes is sports and watching tv shows. I personally don't often have time to sit through television and between working a full time job, doing my practicum, I work 7 days a week 60+ hours right now.

When we first started dating he had lost a job for a reason I still don't know. He then lost another job due to blowing up at a coworker. During this time he hit a serious rough patch, his father had a heart attack (he's totally fine now), he was already living in a basement because he couldn't afford the house when his ex-wife split, and then he lost that and had to move in with his mom. He then got a DUI (i had to pick him up and sign for his release). 4 months later, he got another DUI and I had to deal with picking him up from jail, and since his license was likely suspended he ended up staying at my house (currently here) for the whole week because his court hearing is Monday. 

My issue has been that when trying to calmly talk with him about the DUI and what we can do moving forward, he always wants to ignore me. I have given him resources to therapists that do pro bono and even telehealth but all he wants to do is play fight night, smoke, and even still have at least 1 beer a day. I have told him that I can't condone him drinking in my house especially after another DUI and literally drinking every day since I picked him up from jail. He always gets annoyed and says ""okay Judge Judy, do we have to do this EVERY DAY?!"" and I try not to be offended because I know it's the depression and alcohol talking- but this is getting absurd. 

When he says he'll do things he doesn't, and then gets upset with me even though he says he wants to help (since he isn't working I just ask that he help cook food, he'll vacuum and make the bed and straighten up pillows in the living room.. but I'm never home like I said I work 7 days a week so there isn't a mess to actually clean up). 

I've dealt with alcoholics before, I know the cycle and depression makes it harder. But one thing I also know is that everyone chooses recovery and sobriety on their own time. I'm trying to be patient, but it's extremely expensive feeding 2 people. Also, he and his Pitbull take up a lot of space in my home as I live in a 1 bedroom apartment, and I have my own dog. I have explained that I need my space because I genuinely can't unwind while someone is constantly moping around my house and being angry every time I make a simple suggestion.

2022-08-06 01:53:39,4,False,3,"My (24f) boyfriend (25m) and I had a serious conversation when we first started dating about our expectations in our relationship. It was mainly about communication and the time we will be devoting to one another. For background, in both of our career paths, it is very common to have busy days and at times work long hours (I’m in finance and he’s an architect, both of us in big firms). When we first started dating, I was working full time and he was working part time. Because I was working full time, I would go to bed earlier. I would always text him throughout the day, update him on things and ask him how he was doing. He would almost always respond later at night (past 10 pm) and I would be in bed, so I wouldn’t be able to respond. He told me it upsets him when I don’t respond to his text messages until the next morning, so I told him I’m happy to talk to him throughout the day, and he’s able to talk to me at any point throughout the day. I told him it was a little unfair for him to expect me to stay up late after working all day and having to wake up early the next day just to text him, when he’s working half days or is off work completely. I also told him I understand if he’s busy and can’t talk, and it’s more than enough for him to just say “hey, I have a super busy day today, can’t talk now, but we can talk later”. I understand things get busy, and I don’t expect constant communication throughout the day, but I think checking in with one another throughout the day, 
is totally okay. He said that he thinks it’s still fair to expect me to respond to his texts, but understood that it isn’t fair for him to text me late at night when he has the whole day to reach out, so he’ll work on that, and everything was okay. Basically, we agreed  that we would make time for one another and check in with one another daily (so we know the other person’s safe and ok), but we both understood that we get busy and it’s harder to make plans, we just need to communicate that to one another. I would always make an effort to reach out, and I always made time for the two of us to spend time together (3-4 days in a week). 

He would also get upset with me when we did hang out during the week, and I said I didn’t want to hang out late. So if we’re both free at 5, I asked him to be home by 10:30ish. He would then be close to an hour late and then get upset that I wanted to be home at a reasonable hour. He’s almost always late too, and that’s at least 30-45 minutes late. We had numerous conversations about him always being late, and I told him it’s not fair if during my busy schedule I actively carve out time to be with him, and he can’t do the same. 

Now, we’re both working full time. Since he’s started working full time, we rarely see one another. I told him that I understand he’s working and that’s okay, but he just needs to communicate that. He also doesn’t text me, at all. And when I say at all, I mean 2-3 days go by and it’s radio silence. A while back we had another conversation about this and I told him it hurts me how when we discussed how we wanted to act towards one another, the time we would devote to one another and our comfortable level of communication, it seems to only apply to me when working full time and not him. I repeatedly told him that it’s okay to work, and I get we both love our jobs, and I know that we can’t text all day and hang out all the time (because our jobs are equally as demanding), but it’s unfair for him to layout all of these expectations and be upset with me when I don’t respond to his text the same night, and then for him to go days without reaching out. Nothing’s changed. He’s also still always late whenever we make plans, which is now once a week. He also doesn’t put any effort into making plans, but instead will send me a message an hour or two before and ask if I’m free, as if I’m meant to me there at his every beck and call.

2022-09-26 21:36:27,2,False,1,"I (32M) eldest sibling amongst 2 other siblings am going through friction points with my younger sibling (30M) on issues that have been snowballing for a decade since out early university days.

My philosophy about relationships is that they can only be sustained when they are equitable. 

Meaning, when 1 party hands over a hand and assists, the beneficiary party must return something back in return in order to sustain the relationship, and the exchange doesn’t have to be immediate, but rather over the course of few years and could be in different forms (e.g a message of appreciation, concert tickets, movie night together, or material if necessary). I like to call it “flow”, an exchange of goodness between 2 people.

On the other hand my brother’s approach to sustainable relationships is in the way you communicate. He probably excels at, but it just always appear as BS in real life because I don’t see/feel any action.

This has led us to numerous instances where my brother says words/promises and NOT deliver on them. Later, I realized that he’s the type of person who says all the flowery and uplifting words in the moment and makes you live the dream and undoubtedly doesn’t deliver or take action to justify what was said. A typical copy of setting high expectations and under delivering.

I am the exact opposite. I say less and do more by bringing the family together with dinner invites, social activities, religious gatherings, celebrations, arranging travel plans, booking flights for bros to go backpacking, purchasing flights for parents to reunite etc. Im not saying I’m perfect, I do have my flaws and often times explicitly call out/brag how hard I try to bring the entire family together and no one else even tries to move a finger.

I’m realizing more and more that I’m trying to prove my parents right and deliver on the mission they had setup for us, for the brothers to be united and marching life in key-lock footstep. A mission that I now know is a fallacy because despite us being brothers and growing so close to each other, we have different values and principles in life.

The smallest things that my brother does have become so frustrating and I’m suffering from it.

Lately, he calls me on a Sunday to mention “I’m starving and I’m coming over with my girlfriend, we’re gna grab a small bite and come” so out of respect to them, i rushed into preparing lunch for all of us including my gf and mum. Once the bro and gf came in, they saw the dining table ready and bro says “we actually grabbed lunch on our way, we’re not hungry.” They sat down on the dining table and you could feel the negative energy. 

Had he not mentioned he’s starving, I would have simply rolled up a quick sandwich and grabbed a coffee/drink when he came.

Bottom line:

I’m at a point where have sacrificed so much of my 20s to help my brother establish himself, and did take advantage of every opportunity I gave him. Never gave back his share, neither to me or anyone from the family. He always looks after himself only and prefers to do things that brings him most pleasure as opposed to befitting the goodwill of the family.

I’m tired of always giving time, money, sacrifice into uniting the family without having anybody else contributing their fair share. I’m lost of words with everyone including my parents because they made me believe a fallacy so different than reality and they keep validating how we should continue to be inseparable just like during our childhood.

This is super long &amp; dumb so I'm sorry

Okay so background: i(21f) have these 3 friends(all 22m) who make music and have a small merch business to go along with it. personally, i have been trying to start my own marketing consulting agency, and I agreed to take them on as a client free of charge since I am still learning. Since we started working together, i became the person to keep them organized (running meetings, filing appropriate paperwork, keeping spreadsheets of revenue and expenses, bought the domain etc).  i want to note here my official job is basically a creative director, chief of content and just head of marketing overall.

Context: it was going fine until one of them suggested adding this one girl (lets call her Sarah) to the team so she could handle our photography which would've been great. They wanted her to do our photoshoot and ad campaign for our fall merch. Here's my issue; she has never done a photoshoot before and is only just creating her portfolio, but wanted to charge $250 an hour (totally respect the grind, but right now we have basically all costs and no revenue so budget is strapped). She lowered the price, we went on with the shoot. 

Now here is the problem: one of the friends (lets call him frank) is in charge of the merch. Frank didn't give me any details about this shoot other than a day and time. I asked for all of us, the models, and Sarah to meet an hour before the shoot so we can plan and organize. Frank said we did not need to meet and send me a paragraph of how he wanted the shoot done. I wasn't comfortable but I'm also a model, so I wasn't worried too much about the shoot because I know how to direct and get quality work. When I get to the shoot, there are 2 other girls there (who have never modeled before) and then Sarah and this is Sarah's first official photoshoot.

Throughout the entire shoot, I kept saying how I wanted background changes and different poses. I kept trying to tell Sarah how to angle the camera to get the images I wanted.

LITERALLY everyone ignored me.

At one point, Frank insisted on doing white background with standard poses, and when I told him &amp; the photographer I needed the brown background (The website I designed for the store is fall themed due to the season) and they looked at me like i had 3 heads and kept shooting.

Now they're upset because 1. they didn't use real models so the girls looked as uncomfortable as i remember them saying they were 2. the images are boring on white background and 3. the editing on the pictures is subpar.

Am i being dramatic, WIBTA if i quit??

2022-11-07 20:19:43,20,False,40,"When we first got married in 2020, my wife had a couple of miscarriages and then got really sick after the second one. We didn't know what was wrong but she just had a stomach ache and some abdominal pain and we figured it was a stomach bug. She was mostly just exhausted so it didn't seem urgent at the time. I took care of her for several days when her pain got worse and we decided to get an appointment at urgent care. We called around 10am to get the appointment.

We were scheduled for an appointment late that day around 7:30pm. When we arrived, the place was completely full of people and they told us to wait in the car. We waited for almost two hours, passing the time on the phone with my parents. While we were chatting up my mom and dad her level of pain quickly began to escalate. I hung up the phone and she tearfully told me, ""it just hurts really bad."" She let me know she had to go to the bathroom so I helped her to the reception area when she collapsed in the door. Nobody even moved as if to offer help. I picked her up and I placed her in one of the chairs and started calling 911. When I got on the phone with the emergency services, they asked what was wrong and I told them exactly what was going on. I said, ""My wife just collapsed in the doorway at \[our local urgent care clinic\] and has extreme abdominal pain. Now she has trouble walking."" He said something along the lines of ""Is that it?"" (I still can't tell if it was meant to be snarky) and then told me an ambulance would be on the way. I sat back with my wife and waited. Nobody came to offer any sort of help in the mean time. The ambulance arrived, and I helped my wife to their vehicle. As we went outside, the EMT looked irritated and started asking what happened. The receptionist ran outside and told the drivers, ""We didn't call you, they did"" as she pointed her finger at us as if I did something wrong. The EMT directed my wife to the side door of the ambulance which had steep stairs, so I tried to help her climb them but they didn't want me in the vehicle. They said they didn't need to put on lights or sirens so I followed the ambulance to the hospital in our car. When we got to the hospital we were separated. I was told I wasn't allowed in because of COVID-19 restrictions. My wife told me that when she entered the hospital she collapsed in the doorway and the EMT crossed her arms and glared at her until she was able to get herself up. They essentially just dropped her off at the emergency room desk and told her to get in line.

As my wife waited and the staff told me I wasn't allowed in, I really wanted to trust the system. However, my wife started telling me about how there was a Spanish-speaking family who had five people together in the waiting area (why couldn't I be with my wife?), and a young boy who suffered a severe back injury and said he had been waiting for care for \*five hours\*. My wife wasn't able to tell me at the time, but she told me later that she attempted to go to the bathroom, collapsed, and threw up a lot. When she came out, she told the front desk and they took her to an operating room to perform emergency surgery. It turns out that what we thought was a miscarriage was actually an ectopic pregnancy. They had to remove a Fallopian tube from her because it had completely ruptured and the doctor told my wife that she would have died in four hours had she not been taken care of. I'm grateful that the doctor and nurse in the operating room were polite to her and showed compassion when nobody else did.

It is not in my nature to be rude to strangers or make a scene but looking back I wish I had screamed at all those people, I wish that I yelled at the hospital staff for kicking me out.

On the night of the movie, he and his brother went to our usual cinema instead of the one that we booked in. His brother was also informed by his gf about the place, one of our friends also advised my bf that it's a 30min travel before he left (the usual one is just close to where we were at that night). He was also in the convo when I invited someone to come with us and informed them that it's on a diff place as well. 

They were going to catch up but the boom gate of the place they're at is malfunctioning so he got more annoyed till they decided to just go home. In my mind, I was thinking of telling him off but I knew he's annoyed/mad so I just kept it to myself, kept calm and told him that we can just watch it again together and was just comforting him

But then he started blaming me on why I didn't let him know cause he doesn't read the group chat and that I should've at least thought of telling him.

2022-01-03 05:06:02,20,False,11,"TL;DR My ex-husband has not been financially supporting his children, so I’m taking him to court and cutting off all ties, which includes obtaining his motorcycle through abandoned vehicle laws and I know he won’t get any of the notices. 

My ex-husband has always been the “if you give them an inch, they’ll take a mile” type and has hugely taken advantage of me and the fact that he’s the father of our kids. 

He recently was unemployed for a month, which I understand. He got a new job, and I told him I expect our child support to resume come the following month (I figured a month to establish your job and get your bills straight was fair). The child support is not court-ordered, just an agreed upon amount of $400/month that was signed and notarized by both of us. We have two young children that are not in school yet. 

It took him a year and threatening to take him to court to even start paying and he also never took his agreed upon days of shared custody. 

During his unemployment he moved home to another state and took our children for a month, which is longer than all of his combined visits for the last year or two. 

He’s now refusing to pay, and I told him I’m taking him to court because his poor financial planning (which is a much longer story) excuse is not going to cut it anymore. 

Now this is where the bike comes in. 

I’ve had his motorcycle stored in my garage for the last 6 months and he’s giving me the run-around about when he can get it out of there. 

I’m fed up with his antics, so I looked up the laws of abandoned vehicles. Part of it is he will get a notice and has 15 days to remove the vehicle. However, the address of the registration is our old marital home, which he no longer has access to.

\- Me and my girlfriend are very close and much more honest to each other than with other people. Generally speaking, she is pretty open with me about her feelings, her traumatic experiences, and secrets.

\- We met each other in 2021, she fell in love first, we became friends, and then I fell in love afterwards. So we haven’t been dating for a long time, we’ve only been official for a month. (We were taking things extremely slow)  


Recently she lied about something small:

She hadn’t seen me in a week because of our long distance relationship. I had told her in the past that I don’t want us to skip class or forego our other priorities in order to see each other, but sometimes that means we miss each other for a long time, since we’re busy college students in STEM. She knew I was free all Friday and she lied and told me that her morning class was “cancelled“ when in reality...she was just skipping it to see me.   


She ended up coming clean a few days later. I had asked if her mom knew she drove all the way to tampa, and she explained that her mother thought that she was in class, because her class wasn’t actually cancelled, she just skipped it. She says she didnt want to be judged for skipping class. She continued, that she was sorry about lying, and that she doesn’t know why she feels the need to do that sometimes, since it didn’t make sense.

I told her that I get anxious about being honest with her sometimes, and that I think it’s related to my abandonment anxiety/intrusive thoughts. Since sometimes my brain tells me that if I say something, then she’ll leave me and I’ll be hurt. Even if it’s something small like admitting that her actions upset me. But that I try to tell her anyways. We ended up going on a tangent about the tendency to lie to our parents. She claims that she’s “a little bit of a liar“, and that when I lie it’s more “understandable” because it’s only from feelings of self preservation. 

When I first suspected she lied about skipping class, I started overthinking things, including her character and my perceptions of her. But in general, I was being incredibly anxious. I calmed down, and considered that maybe this is a good opportunity to consult other people, and figure out how to handle this in the healthiest way. We’re very happy with each other, but I don’t want problems to surface, so prevention is the best medicine. The reason I feel the need to dig into this is because I feel very lost about how healthy relationships are supposed to work, I came from a family where I had no examples of people treating each other well.

Okay. So I’m an 18M, she’s a 19F. We’ve been dating for a few months. So, the issue at hand is that, every time she’s visibly upset and I ask her if she’s okay or ask her what’s wrong, she doesn’t answer me or she dodges the question. I may get a “nothing” or “I’m fine” where she’s obviously upset. In fact, I think she actually wants to show that she’s upset. That, or she’s just really bad at hiding it (or I just think she’s upset when she’s not- which I believe is unlikely). It’s probably also worth noting that she gets into these “moods” (which I’m not saying is a bad thing) pretty often. Like, every other day.

I just want to help her when she’s feeling upset but it’s impossible when she won’t open up to me. Plus, it rubs off on me and then I start to feel bad and I can’t do anything about it. Especially if I have a suspicion that she’s upset at me specifically.

Right now, my strategy is to ask if she’s okay first, and if she continues the body language, then I ask her again while pointing out the body language she’s giving off and, if she still doesn’t give an answer, I let it go and assume it’s something she wants to deal with on her own. Maybe I’ll give her a hug or offer to cuddle if I find an opportunity.

I’ve expressed to him time and time again that I need to be able to talk about things, that I feel small and stupid when he ignores me and will only look at me to glare at me. I feel hated when he does this and it hurts. I try my best to be respectful when I do so, but I have requested that we improve our communication again and again. It just hasn’t happened and I get ignored. 

I was just wondering what advice anyone may have on improving our communication and getting him to maybe open up a bit more. He truly is a fantastic person, but I almost feel like I don’t know him at all when he behaves this way. It makes me feel like I don’t matter at all. He’s fast asleep and I’ve been up all night wanting to cry. Ugh. 

TLDR: my husband completely walls me off and ignores me for hours on end when he gets upset about something. It’s usually something small and I always apologize, but it gets me nowhere until he decides I’m worth talking to again. I’ve expressed that I need to talk about things and how horrible it makes me feel being ignored, but nothing has improved.

David Ricardo was more specific; his ""Iron Law of Wages"" said that as long as there was a surplus of labor ('unemployed""), workers would compete for work until wages dropped to a level at which workers could not survive.

We have yet to spend quality time together since we are in a sort of in a long distance relationship. My girlfriend has undiagnosed depression, she has an absent father, unemployed mother, has financial struggles all while living in a small house with 8 &amp; other people with little to no privacy. It makes sense for her to have mental health struggles with such difficult things going on. 

The reality is though that these have been an issue for her for most of her life. And yet she managed to be a loving girlfriend with her words and affection, school was the greatest since we would love spending so much time with each other, but then it all went downhill. The last time she said something sweet or complimented me has been more than month and a half ago, when I talk about future plans the enthusiasm she had once for them are now gone and seems more annoyed, we haven’t flirted through text since then too, and at school she has become sort of cold and doesn’t talk much at all unless I speak to her and when I do the conversation ends almost immediately, while with others is her same old self it’s hurtful when she speaks and engages and laughs with another guy because I just don’t get the same treatment anymore.

It just very difficult for me i feel so unloved, but she can fix it all with the snap of her fingers that’s why I’m still here for her hoping she will come back . I let my feelings get in the way and it causes arguments about how unloved I feel but then she turns into the victim saying she can’t be affectionate because of all the stuff she has to go through, but it has holes since her environment has always been the same even when she was being very affectionate. She blames that I’m not being treated properly like a boyfriend at all on her mental health and calls me selfish for not understanding that. She says she feels very unmotivated and just sits in bed all day in her free time a sign of depression. I guess I messed up by letting my feelings of feeling so unloved and overthinking to cause arguments about jealousy and asking too much form mean while I give her my entire heart.

I (29F) met this guy ""John"" (28M) long long time ago, when we were in the university. I liked him instantly, however I was in my first relationship. I was pretty sure he liked me too, but nothing ever happened because I loved my boyfriend at the time. In the meantime I became really good friends with John and we were hanging out often, just as friends. My relationship started to crumble and often I would find myself crying to John because my bf at the time was neglecting me a lot. After a really bad breakup, I kinda stopped spending much time with anyone, fell into the depression for almost a year and became a hermit. 
John found himself a girlfriend and I was happy for him. I would occasionally still talk and hang out with him, and with his girlfriend who I always respected, John was forever crossed from the list. 
I cared much more about our friendship than anything else, and there were 0 tensions whatsoever. 


I moved countries, they even came to visit me to my current place once before covid.


9 years later, John calls me one day and says his gf dumped him. He says bad things about her, never actually disclosing the reason why they broke up.
He was apparently ""not good enough"" for her, because he was wearing sweatshirts all the time.
He also says how she hated me and was always jealous of me, and I got very offended by it, because I NEVER did ANYTHING to her or to him. 

(However I should also learn not to trust trashy men who have just been dumped. But ok.)


He starts spending more time with me, calling me, hanging out again. Previously he didnt contact me for almost 2 years, which was also the blame of his ex gf, which was ""controlling"" him. His words.

He starts showing interested in me, and we talk almost every day by that point. I was really happy because I missed him, and to be honest we didnt hang out like that in a very long time. After all, it was just after covid and lockdowns were over.

I noticed that he was interested in me and making some moves, but I told him it's the wrong time. He is just from the breakup. He said he agrees.

A few months have passed (5 months after the breakup) and he is still making small moves on me, we still talk. I got back to my home country and John invited me to his place at the seaside.
He tells me I can stay at one of the apartments his family rents. I say ok.


I came to John's place, there was his entire family on the ground floor of the house, and apartment was on the second. I met the whole family and it was super weird, because he didn't tell me anything. I ate with them at the table every day, it felt like he brought a ""fresh new girlfriend"" home. I didn't say anything, but was weirded out.


On the second day John actually made a move and kissed me. Said he loved me and he waited for this for so so long to happen. Since he first time saw me.
To be honest, after months and months of him persuading me, I fell for it and believed it.
He said he wants us to be together, and that I've always been so special to him. That he cares so much about me. Blabla

We spend 2 weeks together, however I saw him talking to some other girls while texting.

After texting one girl, I saw her name and I asked who was he texting, he said ""noone, just friends group"" which was bullshit.



I have to go back to where I work, he suddenly changes and becomes super cold towards me. I try texting him but he is ignoring me. I try everything but he changed completely after what happened between us.


I confront him, he says that ""It's the distance between us, otherwise we would be together"" (the distance is 600km and I'm on my last year of PhD, after which I'm planning to go back home).
He also claims that he cares SO MUCH about me but we cannot be together, and I'm ""not just a rebound"".
He swears that I was not just a rebound to him, that I'm special, blah blah blah. That I need to promise him that we will be friends forever because he can't stand losing me. What a bunch of bullshit.


I come again for winter, he is promising that he will take me everywhere and hangout with me and spend time with me - he is nowhere to be found.

I delete his number because everything he said and did to me was absolute bullshit. And we were obviously never friends from the beginning. At least he wasnt.



5 months pass, he starts messaging me from another number. He asks me to meet him because he misses me so much. Curiosity took better of me and I actually went, and I swear to god I lost a few braincells.

John was still crying over his ex who dumped him, talking how he will never get over her. He was also telling me how he is going to weddings of random people who he doesnt know, with some random girl. When I asked him which girl, he didnt want to say.
When I asked him can he tell me if he has a girl or not -he didnt want to tell me.
I asked him to be a decent human being and tell me if he is seeing someone, he was making excuses and avoiding the question. 


He continues texting me and promising me stuff - that we will hang out, that he cares so much about me, etc etc.


My birthday comes, he texts me saying that he will come visit me to my place. I say sure sure, because I know he wont. He is saying for 1 year that he will come, but I know he wont. So he says ""I'm coming on 22nd!"" - sure sure you are.

Few days later he says ""I'm not coming, tickets are too expensive, 200€"".

I say Im pretty sure that they are 30€. He says ""oh i was planning to come on 18th but I didnt tell you, I am going to a girl friends party on 22nd""

What the actual fuck. 

I ask him what the fuck is wrong with him. 
He is saying how much sorry he is, and blahblah.

I tell him I'm done with this shit, and I have been done long ago.

He starts asking me did I start writing my PhD, when I'm coming back, how long do I need to stay more, etc etc.
Like, am I in a hurry suddenly?
Is he my mother asking me did I start writing phd every day??what the actual fuck.


Some days pass, and finally today he says ""I went out with a girl"" for no reason whatsoever. 
I say ""and""?
And he says ""it's starting to get serious"" so I ask ""wtf that means, are you in a relationship or not?""
And he says ""yes I am"".


So that is actually how I blocked him again, and never want to speak or hear him again. I am really against ghosting people, but there is nothing more to say here. 

I was sick to my stomach from all the promises that he will come to my place, how we will hang out, he also invited himself to my house at the seaside, etc etc.

I'm just disgusted, and sad.

John was never my friend, he just used me and covered it up with ""you were definitely not a rebound"" and ""i care so much about you"".

So i started dating this girl 3 months ago, everything was going good until our 1 month anniversary! Side note she has Borderline Personality disorder! But a month after we made it official as bf and gf she broke up with me! However the night that she broke up with me i drove home and took a nap and woke up to her texting me asking to call! We talked on the phone and she was crying and saying that she still wanted to hangout! My dumbass was like yeah we can do that! But after that we kept hanging out and like having sex and chillin! Then a week ago she calls me and tells me that she needs a break from hanging out from everyone and that she wants this to work out but doesn’t think she’s good enough mentally for it, and immediately after that tells me she’s spending the night at her friends house the next night! We still text everyday and she calls me but we’re not together! Im just confused on what to do now because i really want it to work but i feel like she’s just using me or seeing someone else and doesn’t want to let go so what do i do? Also i hung out with her for a little bit yesterday and the whole time she was rubbing herself on me and when i left she kissed me, I’m also a heavy over thinker with bad anxiety and i just don’t know what to do and i really like her!",relationship_advice,HELP ME,2.5,2022-07-04

So I (15F) have 3 best friends. I've known them for 7 years and I love them.

Today I snapped at my friend (call her Alison) who is my best friend. She and my two other friends (Sara and  Sophie let's call them) have been acting super strange with me and I think they've stopped liking me. They constantly ignore me,  tell me to just go away because they want to talk to each other,  but at times they're still normal. Like last week Sophie asked Sara and Alison if they wanted to come over and hang out at Sophies House and they said yeah, so i asked if I could come too if that was okay. Suddenly Alison gets her phone out,  looks like she was texting and then Sara and Sophie get a notif on their phone.

I genuinely think they have a gc without me and chat shit about me. That may be me being paranoid though.
Sophie said 'Oh no my mom might not let you,  you know and we're gonna read the Quran (so sorry if I spelt it wrong forgive me) and you can't so...' 
BTW they are all Muslim and I don't have a religion.
I was like, 'That's absolutely fine, I respect that!'

I was at home then like a couple of hours later and I was on SnapChat and then I saw on Sophies story that they had popcorn and a bunch of food while It Chapter 2 was on in the background. I was hurt because they know I love horror movies. Im okay if you aren't gonna invite me but don't lie about it. Then they started to openly talk about their plans in front of me and I wasn't invited. So I started to feel like shit.

Then they full on just walk off while we are out in public without me. I had to wander around town just alone until I went home and they were like
'OhHh wHeRe dID yOU gOoOo'

Im just crying every day,  they aren't the people that I knew and loved for 7 years. Then me and Sara and Alison are having a little argument about caring about our grades and shit and I'm not being big-headed but I know I'm smart. Im not gonna sit there and be like 93 oh that's such a bad scoreee, it's damn good and I'm proud I'm smart enough to get it. I don't study often but I still turn in homework and do tests and I get a good score. I don't go around preaching how smart I am and whatever,  but as I was saying I was just telling them I don't really care about my grades,  I know I'm smart enough to still get a pretty good score.

Sara and Alison kept just persisted and then Sara said:
''Just leave it Ali she's stubborn,  she won't listen. ''
I just saw red. Then I remember shouting: 'I won't listen?  I listen to all your shitty plans and bullshit excuses, and you make me feel like a piece of shit''
Then I began to cry and just ran off. I feel bad about it. Should i?  After I ran off I avoided them until I got home and then they just blew my phone up. I put my phone on Do Not Disturb because I can't look at the messages.

Unfortunately, when arriving I found out my father and his wife never set up anything payment wise and left it all to me. I also realized that the scholarship was not at all how it had been explained to me. I don’t remember the exact numbers but basically over a thousand a month. Fafsa wouldn’t help considering my parents made too much money. They could not set up a payment plan anymore as it was too late. 

My father’s wife said it was too much and I had to find ways to try to lessen it. At the same time I was dealing with a lot of mental health issues so an advisor advised me to not attend classes until my situation was resolved. I talked to a lot of people -including the dean- to try to find a way through this situation while also working 30 hours a week to try to make enough money. In the end when they realized there wouldn’t be a way it was too late for me to withdraw without getting charged. 

I still owe almost $7,000. 

I attended classes once in the beginning but I was told that despite withdrawing and not properly attending classes I still needed a transcript from the school. Which is impossible considering the amount of money I owe. You are not allowed access to your official transcript until you owe nothing to the school.

2022-09-01 00:00:24,16,False,6,"For context, I’m a full time college student living with my parents in a rather cushy and expensive part of California. 

I recently got hired at a lovely little bistro-type cafe as a kitchen worker, specialising in morning prep for their food. The hours are awful, 3:30am-12 most days, but it’s what I signed up for. The advertised pay was a start at $18 an hour, plus tips. 

During the phone interview process, the hiring manager mentioned “… we try to pay our employees a liveable wage, especially for this area…” 

Now, I get that it’s not up to interpretation of what the actual “liveable” wage would be. The average rent for an apartment around here is $1350-$1800 a month, which would include utilities. However, at $18 an hour, and 35-40 hours a week, my paycheck would hand me anywhere from $1200-$1400, making that $2400-$2800 a month. 

Gas is also about $5-5.29gallon, averaged between the lowest prices in my area of 4.69-5.49. My car holds 14.5, and my commute is close to 10 miles a day, 20 round trip, plus school which adds another 5. I drive about 25 miles every day, and have to fill up about once a week, for $78. 

Purchasing groceries, textbooks, gas, rent, health insurance, car payments, and phone bills all adds up to another $500-$700 a month. 

Their wage isn’t liveable, not by an immediate 20 mile radius of the job standard. 

So what do they base this off of? Federal averages? A mindset of “well at least we pay more than minimum” assertion? 

It makes me frustrated knowing that even these “cozy” and rather lucrative jobs for someone privileged enough to be in my position would still be poverty wages for someone else.

Throwaway account
I(26f) met my now husband(25m) 4 years ago online. He was a student at university and I was working full time as a medical tech. He was very hard working, ambitious, goal-oriented person these are some of qualities that was attractive to me, he’s an immigrant and I knew his family’s financial struggles. I was impressed by how far he’s come,  I would supporting him in his goals. Soon after we started dating and 2 years ago we got married.

He graduated from college and found a job at a tech company and he would work from home while I’d work 12 hour days on-site. I’d ask about his salary and he would tell me it’s $60k. I didn’t think of it much and continued with life. I only made $20/hr and I have lots of loans that I usually pay.

Fast forward one year, he moved to a new city and while I was struggling to find job in new city so I stayed back for 3 months. After 3 months, he surprises me with a house that is on his name only. He would never talk to me about his finances, he got loan for 400k house on 60k salary. I still didn’t pay attention and Since our marriage he’s the one talking care of finances and taxes etc. 

I wanted to purchase house for my mother and sister. I found the perfect house and my bank requested me for Tax returns of last 3 years. I requested my husband to send it to me but he would insist that he’d like to talk to bank or he would handle the situation and would try to convince me that his bank is better than mine but I had already locked down on this deal and I wasn’t going to budge. So finally, after a lot of argument he sent me the tax returns. And, the tax return income for last year was a whopping $1.8M and my contribution was $38K.

I (f) am a student worker for my university.This year I started working with a new coworker. We quickly clicked and I started hanging outside of work with him and another friend because she thought he was cute and asked if I could set them up. We all would hang out and have sleepovers but he never showed interest back in her. 

As we kept hanging out he revealed to me that he actually has known who I am for over a year. Not too weird. Then he mentioned that he looked up my name over a year ago and went through all of my public info from high school and found my Instagram and had been looking at all my stuff ever since. Kind of uncomfortable.

At one of these sleepovers we had all together while I was pretending to be asleep he touched up my thighs and stomach. I told him never to do that again and never slept over with him again.

He used to barely show up at work and was thinking of quitting. I had stopped talking to him for a couple weeks because I was frustrated with him and then he started showing up to work everyday. I talked with him once more last night to see if there was anything worth saving and he once again brought up info from before he had even met me.

My best friend (let’s call her Amy) planned a night out for us as a goodbye. She lived about 1.5 hours from me, so I was going to stay the night at her place. We went out, danced, and drank a lot.

There was this one creepy guy that kept following us around. Eventually, drunk Amy got so afraid of him that she ran out of the bar. Instead of following her immediately, I went to the bartender and asked him to make sure that guy didn’t follow us out. Then I went outside, and Amy was nowhere to be seen.

An unrelated fight broke out. I was scared and alone. I had no idea where Amy was. And then magically her boyfriend’s car pulls up with Amy in the passenger seat. I could not have been more relieved. I excitedly got in the car. The second I got in, the boyfriend rolled up his windows and started screaming “YOU LOST MY FUCKING GIRLFRIEND” at me. She was like half asleep in the car.

I cried and said I tried my best to watch out for her. He’s kind of a scary man so I was crying a LOT. Then he pulls over and screams “get out of my fucking car”. It was 2am, I was drunk, and we were in the bad part of town. I then called my boyfriend and sat on the side of the road until he drove 1.5 hours to pick me up in the middle of the night.

I very awkwardly drove up again the next day to get my things from her place that I left for the sleepover. She was confused as to why I hadn’t slept over, so I told her the story. Amy’s response was that she drinks too much when she’s with me because I’m an alcoholic. (which I’m not, but even if I was, I don’t think this comment made any sense).

Before that night, she promised she would visit me at my new place on my birthday, which she did not. I was visiting my parents for xmas, so I got to see her for an awkward lunch. Now I moved back to the area a few months ago. I try time and again to reach out, tell her I love her, I’m here for her, I want to see her, etc. but she always has excuses. And it’s not like I can just pop by her house because the boyfriend lives there.

I love Amy so much, but I feel like I have tried everything. I’m sure her boyfriend made up some bullshit about how I’m a bad friend and should’ve stopped her from drinking so much. Everything is weird, and I’m wondering if I should stop trying.

I can't keep any friends no matter how hard I try. Either we grow apart or find out one of us never really liked the other. And I'm always the one who gets hurt or puts more into it than the other.

Every since my parents split up when I was 9, my childhood went downhill. From going through so much trauma, depression and instantly being replaced by my dad's new wife and kids who only wanted us out of the picture, I always stayed to myself and never made friends from 4th grade throughout school.

As an adult in my 30's, I've had one failed friendship to the next throughout my 20's and one recently and I've grown tired of it. Starting to accept that maybe it isn't meant for me to have friends. 

As an adult, the only place I've been able to meet people is at work, and I know that's a terrible place to make friends. And maybe that's the problem, but where else can you meet actual genuine people without the fear of being kidnapped. 

Recent friendship ended due to a random fallout where I was basically projected onto. I was told I said so many wrong things that were not addressed until 8 months after they happened. I was slowly getting pushed away in the meantime but I still tried to fight to keep things going. Because I didn't experience friendships growing up and knew something was off, but I wanted to show that I cared by forcing it I guess. Still didn't work. 

I addressed everything my friend at the time said and explained that was not my intentions. I was not told I accept your apology or thanks for clearing that up or anything. So I mentioned things that this ""friend"" did to me too that really bothered me and I was gaslighted. I tried to overlook these things for almost a year because I really valued their friendship. But I never thought by mentioning them, that things would become so heated.

I was told that I was wrong for feeling a way about being neglected, ignored, being uninvited from things their ""friends"" were invited too, and that I didn't like their friends and was dismissed and told good luck. When I was always super cordial and supportive of their friends. What sucks is I literally talked to this person daily and checked on them daily when they had covid. When I had it, I was checked on once. Overall I put way more into it than I was given.

This happened in February and is very traumatizing to me. What makes matters worse is this person has tried to act like things are ok but never truly apologized to me and I can't move past it. And we work together. Alotting 15 minutes or even an hour is not long enough to talk and I feel like they just want to do all the talking and I'm supposed to just listen and forgive then go back to normal. All because I was emotional support due to their spouse being very nonchalant and emotionally unavailable.

I feel like I was used for an emotional affair and even their husband was onboard to ending the friendship with me so why come back now? They even brought their husband and child to work recently and came to my desk to see me. So they stopped by on their way to the beach in 30° weather. It was so awkward. Then said they wanted to see me. How?? 

I'm not able to open up to anyone else now due to trust issues and it's making me very standoffish
I'm just so confused and yes I know I need therapy for this and probably a lot of other things. But this really affects me. Sorry for the book and for any typos or grammar issues.

It's been a bit of time for me to process exactly what has happened, but I got into my top school for Early Decision. I know that I should be ecstatic and that I should be basking in praise or whatever because there is list of reasons that's like 50 points long of why it is exactly what I want and more in a school, and it's not like it's an easy school to get into necessarily, or that its programs are lacking in what I'm majoring in. I just feel underwhelmed. I spent all of my childhood doing everything I could to excel, and to be seen as smart. I have a leadership role in every club and activity I am part of, and my grades are definitely nothing to scoff at. I know that these are the things that got me into this school, but now I won't even get the chance to know if they would've gotten me into any other schools that are harder to get into.

When I was a kid, I dreamed of going to Harvard. I thought I could make it to one of those, and everyone around me encouraged it because I had a thirst for learning. I took the hard classes, and I did **well** in them. I pushed myself to be the best in what I was passionate in, and it showed. But the school have committed to now is not Harvard. I feel like I let everyone down, but mostly I feel like I let my younger self down. After all, there was no reason she needed to work *that* hard if this is the school that she's going to.

People are supposed to feel excited when they get accepted into college, that much I do know. I just felt entirely neutral about the whole ordeal. I opened it on my computer with my parents in my room, and the only thing I could think was *I don't know what I'll do if I get rejected*, and I felt nothing after I saw I was in. I have been faking it ever since opening that acceptance. Faking excitement, and faking happiness. I've wanted to go to this school since my sophomore year, but now that I can, it just feels underwhelming that everything I worked for could have been achieved with less than half the work I did. Other people that I know were accepted to the same school took half my course load and have a quarter of my extracurriculars with no leadership, so why did I stress myself to the point of not eating for two months just so they could be exactly where I am?

2022-12-27 05:43:37,31,False,54,"I am a 34M and for pretty much as long as I remember, I have always had an issue with thinking that people hate me over the smallest things either said, that I interpret or really over anything. For a lot of my youth I would feel this all the time and I ended up essentially buying friendships to satisfy my mind that people don't hate me but as I became an adult, that is much harder.

I feel this way like over anything, let it be ignored or talked over in a conversation, someone makes fun or dislikes something I like, someone criticizes something I do or think and I interpret it as said in a non-constructive way, thinking I am being talked about in secret (I remember specifically a time where my friends sat across from me on the bus, they both covered their faces and whispered to themselves while looking at me and I became very anxious they were talking bad about me that I immediately got off the bus and cancelled our plans because of it). Feeling this way causes me to feel so awful and sick feeling, to the point where a few times this happened and I carried this feeling to my place of work, I ended up quitting said job when a manager said something to me during the shift that I ended up also thinking that they hated me or they think my work is so bad that I should just quit to let someone better work.

The times where it's the worst is when a friend of mine would actually get mad at me over something I do or said and it would lead me to have some real dark thoughts in which I would believe it would make everyone happy because everyone hates me, or I would do stuff smaller like stop eating or self-ostracize myself after feeling like since they hate me, they ostracize me so to make others happy I should just not be seen or heard from.

These thought have made it very, very difficult to make new friends and just be open in general. I never talk about myself to anyone, including my friends really about anything I do or like. I almost never post on social media and if I do, I often get no interaction and I end up feeling disliked and I end up deleting said posts. I always wanted to play online games or do things online with people and make friends but I find it very difficult as well.

I hate feeling like this and I don't know what to do. This constantly feeling has really fucked my personality up and has prevented me from doing a lot of things I want to do, due to immediately thinking that shit will go bad and people will hate me, ignore me or ostracize me, even when it comes to being on the internet and even holding a job.",socialskills,How Do I Stop Thinking Everyone Hates Me?,42.5,2022-12-27

I should mention that there was no prior warning and he told me planning to leave within the hour. I said this was fine but then dad mentioned that I would need to stay home to look after my youngest brother (6m) and I could not go out or stay at my boyfriends, like I had planned and told my parents already. We also live in Australia where it’s extremely hot right now and my boyfriend and I had planned to go to the beach for sunset and stay at his house, as it’s closer to the beach. Tomorrow morning we also have a yoga class at the beach near his house, meaning staying at my house we would have to skip it as it is too far from my house. I told my dad this and he basically told me too bad and that I had to stay here and watch my brother and cancel any plans, or I would have to take youngest brother to the beach as well. It’s also worth mentioning that I have another brother (15m) who will be at my house tonight who is more than capable of watching my youngest brother, but on top of this my dads friend (40m) is living in our spare room and will be home tonight, meaning there are already two people perfectly capable of watching my youngest brother.

I said I didn’t want to stay and it was pointless, plus he’s not my kid and my dad guilt tripped me saying I’m his older sister and I need to take care of him. He also threatened to take away Christmas presents and called me selfish for not wanting to look after family. This did make me feel guilty because although he isn’t my kid, maybe my dad is right because he is family so maybe I should have just sucked it up and agreed straight away, but I argued with my parents and said they can compromise their plans or be happy with the TWO people already at home who can look after him. This caused a bit of a scene and my parents got mad at me and are ignoring me and have gone ahead and booked the hotel but have not come to talk to me about where they stand on my opinion.

The history is I met her when I started a job back in 2014.  We worked together and became friends, hanging out after work, hanging out on mutual days off.  I've asked if her husband minded, she says he doesn't.  I've hung out with her/his family, it's mostly his as she doesn't have any in the area.  Gone over on holidays like Halloween or New Years.  We've all taken a trip together.  At the time I did live in a more rural part of the county, definitely away from her and our job.  So it made sense that I would travel out to her to meet up.

Come 2018, I changed jobs, but we still worked in the same building.  So we'd still see each other.  And we'd still meet up and go to lunch on mutual days off.  Around this time I did move closer to work, and her family happened to move as well, and wound up about 5 minutes away from me.  So when we did meet up, we alternated who drove to whom.  Seemed fair.

The pandemic hit, and our lunches came to a halt as places were closed.  We did still meet up here and there, but it was the beginning of the pandemic so we were more cautious and didn't do so often.  But once things opened up we did resume meeting up weekly, except for 5 weeks of training I had to do for a second job.  I was furloughed from my job, and instead of returning I found other employment. 

Around November/December I got hit with covid.  My whole family did, and that delayed my mother's surgery, which I needed to be available to help her recover afterwards.  So there was about 2-3 months during Thanksgiving/Christmas/New Years that we didn't hang out.  But we still talked.  Once my mom recovered, we resumed.  But that was short lived as my mother had a second surgery planned in a couple of months.  And during that time, my friend moved as well, and now lived further away but also in a more rural town (less rural than I originally lived).

After my mom's second surgery and recovery, my mom planned a birthday party for herself.  She wanted to have something.  And my mom knows my friend from work.  They didn't work together, Mom works for a completely separate company but still the same building and theyd see each other walking around the halls, or outside on smoke breaks, which is how they would talk.  And I became friends with her, so her family would be invited over as well to things.

My mom invited her via Facebook.  Actually, that's how all the invites went out.  But my friend didn't respond.  Ignored it.  But at the same time she was planning a birthday party for her husband a month later.  And invited me.  I didn't respond, and now we just weren't talking to each other either.  My mom says she's too old to care about my friend not responding, but it bothers me because it would be one thing to say ""oh she just doesn't go on FB a lot.""  But at the time she was planning her own event and posting pictures from a trip she went on.  And when you just ignore an invite, FB reminds you.  So I knew she was getting similar notifications.  That bothered me.

Abouth a month after that, 2 months after Mom's birthday, they met up someplace and talked for a few minutes.  My mother never mentioned the invite to her party, but my friend said ""we had a party for (husband) and I thought nj\_fan was going to come"" and ""tell him to stop avoiding me.""  Well, I did stop, a month later I reached out and we went to lunch a week after that.  Nothing was said of the past events, until the next time we went to lunch, but the only thing was my friend said to me ""stop avoiding me"" and I replied ""the phone works both ways.""  We went to lunch a few more weeks after that.  Until I needed to take a week to study for an exam.  I took classes for real estate, and was finally getting ready to take a test.

I passed.  Told my family.  Then told my friend, and her reply was not congratulations, but rather ""I'm in Kalamazoo."" I knew she was going away.  Her and her husband like to follow a band around and do so every couple of month.  And it was supposed to be some big weekend for this band, but covid scaled it back.  I wasn't looking to hang out, but she couldn't congratulate her friend?

I was a little put off by that.  So we didn't do lunch the next week.  But that week was also my birthday, and while I didn't have a party or anything, she never even texted me ""happy birthday.""  Yes they were back, because that was only a weekend trip.  In the past we would exchange ""happy birthday"" on each other's birthday, and if I was off of work and so was she, we'd go to lunch.  So that felt odd.

I left it at that, but then got sick.  Not sure if it was covid, as the test came back negative, but I didn't go out that week at all.  And Thanksgiving was coming up anyway, something I do with my family.  The following week I did reach out to her and we met up for lunch.

Now, since I did pass my real estate exam, one of the things you do is interview brokerages.  And I interviewed one that same week, later on, but had a bad experience at that interview.  I went to text my friend just to vent.

Me:  ""Are you busy?""

Her:  ""I have a ton of laundry to do.""

I felt that I couldn't even talk, which is all I wanted to do.  I did ask her another question and got a genuine reply, so maybe she just did have a ton of laundry and couldn't talk.  And maybe I could have said ""Are you busy?  Just had a bad experience and really need to talk to somebody.""

The next and last time we met up for lunch was December 7th.  With the holidays approaching, life can be crazy so we just didn't meet up.  But, I noticed we didn't talk either.  Right after Christmas is her birthday.  In the past I was invited over for her birthday, except for 2020 because some places were still closed, I was helping my mom recover, and her family had members who came down with covid as well so they kept anything they had small.  This year, I texted her ""happy birthday"" and got an invite to come over that night as they were having a cookout.

I was taken aback.  Now, for years my family couldn't eat dinner together, save for a few nights a month.  14 years.  The pandemic changed things, but for that it changed it for the better, and now we can each dinner every night together.  And do so.  We plan these meals out.  So one person saying ""Oh, change of plans, I'm going out"" can change the dinner plans for everybody.  So while that can happen, something can come up, it rarely does.  Do we make plans for going out?  Sure.  ""Hey, next Tuesday I won't be home for dinner.""  Or even ""tomorrow I won't be home for dinner.""  That's okay.  But day of can lead to people scrambling.  

That was the last text.

And I realized that once she moved, I was always the one texting her to see if she wanted to do lunch.  And, while I drove to her house when I lived further away from her and our jobs, once she moved away, I was once again the one driving.  I live in a city with plenty of places to hang out, eat, etc.  But there's probably 4 places in her town, not counting fast food, to eat at.  And some aren't open 7 days a week (not talking about chick-fil-a).  Now, the old town I lived in, that had 4 places to eat at and that's counting McDonald's and Bojangles.

What I think I realized is that I did let her snubbing my mother's birthday party affect me.  I used that to ignore her husband's birthday party.  And she probably did the same once it was my birthday.  Despite us going out to lunch between that, and her never saying now to going out to lunch, it's never been brought up.

We've been through a lot.  And she would help me through my depression.  And it sucks that we've been friends since 2014 and this is where it's at.  I just don't know how to move forward and repair the damage done. I'm sure we need to talk about things, but I don't even know where to begin.  Why is it that I'm always the one reaching out to see what day this week she wants to hang out?  Why is it that I'm the one driving out to her place always now that there is distance between us once again?

We all have different days off as well, so this means our only time to socialise as a group is after work. Slowly it became habit for us all to hang out after closing up, for a couple of hours, so I'd be coming home at 2 or 3am.

My parents began to take issue with this, or specifically my mum. My dad doesn't care but says I should just listen to what my mother says about the matter. Basically she became unhappy with my staying out late, and put a curfew on me, saying that I have to come home straight after work except on weekends- when I can stay out until 1am or occasionally 2am.

Now, it's not that I wake her up when I come in, I'm dead quiet coming in. Her issue is that she worries about me. She says she can't sleep properly / keeps waking up and checking I'm back, until I'm home.

I feel that I am an adult and should be allowed independence, especially given that my brother, who is 21, is allowed to stay out as long as he wants (though he is a bit of a shut in and doesn't go out much). My mum's answer to this is that I'm a girl so she worries about me more and it keeps her awake at night, and it's unfair &amp; selfish to disrupt her sleep patterns like that. I genuinely don't want her to not be getting sleep but I find it very frustrating that this impinges on my social life. I've had to miss out on certain celebrations like friends' birthdays. Also, when I come in, if I try to make dinner or eat anything in the fridge, the noise wakes them up and it annoys them. So I can only eat dinner with my friends, or at 3pm before my shift and be starving.

My friends would always tell me not to worry about it when I had to leave early, and when I was upset about the curfew, they reassured me that my mum would probably chill out once I went to university.

My first term went great, and I came back and started again at my job. However my mum warned me straight away that the curfew was still in effect.

It was such a shame because I really love my friends and want to be able to spend more time with them. Every time I argue about the curfew though, my mum says I'm being unreasonable and shouts at me calling me selfish (she is the kind that always shouts in an argument, I am more of an angry-crier, and I get flustered and can't hold up my own argument).

Sorry for the long-winded post, I just wanted to give all the context. Am I being an asshole/selfish for asking that I'm allowed to stay out without a curfew?

For context, I really don’t like causing harm to any creature if I can avoid it. I also think spiders are super neat.

However, last summer, I had a secret that I kept from her.

In our back yard we have a set of string lights that span the back yard and provide some nice ambiance at night. The lights run right through these branches of a tree. You tend to not really look at them because why would you inspect lights, ya know?

One day, I looked up and spotted a web running between the lights and a branch. Turns out this thing was pretty damn large. I didn’t see any resident on it at first, so I kind of ignored it. The next time I looked though, there was a big boy spider sitting right in the middle of it. We live in Quebec so we definitely don’t have anything dangerous here, but it was big enough that she would not have been happy about having it live so close to us.

I, however, thought it was really damn cool. Not wanting to have to dismantle its’ meticulously built home and evict the little guy, I never told her about it. It stayed there all summer, chillin’ and catching bugs. I spent all summer looking at it and checking out what it was up to.

2022-05-14 12:49:33,1,False,1,"My brother-in-law \[31m\] has been close to my family even before I was born. He went to elementary school with my oldest sister and his now wife \[31f\]. They started dating when they were about 14 if I'm remembering correctly. My mom \[52f\] was pregnant with me at the time. However, their relationship was off and on when they were teens, and they really didn't get serious they were in college.

He and his sister \[38f\] were even the go to babysitters for me and my other two sisters \[22f, twins\] when we were very young. They were the fun babysitters, and they used to take everywhere we wanted to go, like bowling or the local mall. As such, he's been a part of my life for as long as I can remember.

I've known my sister-in-law \[26f\] since I was 10. My brother \[26m\] met her at a bar when he was in the army and deployed to Germany. She was a Romanian-Ukrainian woman who traveled to Germany in search for a job. They hit it off right off the bat and hooked up pretty quickly. The first time that I saw her was when she flew to the states to visit my brother and met our family.

She made a pretty good impression on us, despite her accent being a little hard for me and my family to understand at first. My now sister-in-law took me, the twins, and our little nieces to a theme park during her stay. This was a very rare treat for us, as the park was a bit far away and expensive for our family. She and my brother got married a few months later.

The both of them have done so much for me over the years. They openly refer to me as a brother, despite us not blood related. My brother-in-law feels like something like a cool dad, uncle, and older brother all wrapped up in one. He was the one who taught me how to drive stick shift, how to fish and hunt, took me to a car dealership to search for my first car, and I went with him to my first concert.

I used to have a small crush on my sister-in-law when I first met her, but she is pretty much my older sister now. She has taken me on several rides on her motorcycle, has tried teaching me how to speak Romanian and Ukrainian, goes shopping for me all the time, and loves giving me dating advice. The three of us often bond with video games, movies, and books. Whenever I'm sick or injured, they drop everything to help take care of me.

They are also both very protective of me. Last year, I was in a toxic relationship. Won't go into too many details, as that is a story all in itself. However, a short gist is that my ex was very controlling and possessive of me. She would bomb me with dozens of messages an hour, and get upset if I didn't respond right away.

Most of those messages was her interrogating me over what I thought of her, with some occasional suicide threats if I dared to leave. My ex also demanded that I stayed away from all females other then her, which included my own family. I tolerated all of that no matter how miserable it made me, as I thought I was in love with that girl.

Needless to say, no one of my family (including my in-laws) liked her at all. Both my sister-in-law and brother-in-law, along with my other siblings and parents, tried encouraging me to dump her dozens of times. This all came to a boiling point one day when I chose to hang with my two in-laws over my ex at my sister and brother-in-law's house.

As I was playing some halo with them, I got a text from my ex demanding that I go outside. I looked out the window and there she was standing in the driveway. My in-laws tried telling me to stay put, but I went out to see what she wanted. My ex was furious that I blew her off and accused me of cheating. She then started hitting and kicking me really hard.

After what felt like an eternity, my ex suddenly stopped and started trembling. I looked behind me and there was my two in laws glaring her down. They berated her for hurting me like and told my ex that we were done. She tried apologizing, but they wouldn't have any of it.

My brother-in-law told my ex that he was taking her home and they were going have a word with her parents. As he drove away with her, my sister-in-law asked me for my phone. When I gave it to her, she looked through all of my texts with my ex. She screenshotted many of them, texted them to herself and other family members, and blocked my ex on my phone and every social media that I had. My sister-in-law then lectured me on learning how to be safe in relationships, and added that she lost one of her aunts in Romania to an abusive husband.

Our family gathered up in the evening to discuss my ex. My parents, siblings, and in-laws decided that we should report her to the school administration. The school separated us as much as they could, which included removing her from classes we had together. Several weeks later, my ex's family moved away and I never heard from her again.

Without my in-laws and other family members, I don't think I wouldn't be able to escape that relationship. They helped me in my lowest moments, and I just don't know how to thank them for thank. I love them both so much and I want to show my appreciation. I've tried doing many chores at their homes and babysit their children whenever I can.

However, I don't that is enough. What can I do to show my gratitude towards my in-laws? Any advice will be appreciated.

2022-05-14 12:49:34,9,False,0,So I’ve been seeing this girl for almost a year now and we aren’t dating but are exclusive to eachother. My issue is she has a lot of guy friends and one group of these guy friends are frat guys which wouldn’t be a big deal to me normally but she’s kissed one of them in the past and she’s told me that they flirt with her and pick her up and toss her around. She also goes out drinking a few times a week and has recently made a new guy friend at the club. My issue is I trust her 100% but at a certain point it becomes too much and disrespectful to me and we’ve talked about it already but she wants her freedom. I feel like she can change but I wonder if it’s better to just end things.,relationship_advice,(21)F I’ve been seeing for a year now has lots of guy friends and I(24)M am having issues taking her seriously,4.5,2022-05-14
2022-05-22 22:13:28,0,False,1,"Me and my ex (20f) have have been in an off and on LDR, she broke it off with me two months ago and we have not talked since. We were close friends months before dating and had dated 2-3 months.

I had bought plane tickets to go and see her, and and I was planning to go study abroad with her to close the distance. I planned to go during spring break, but with Covid restrictions still in effect and my terminally ill grandfather having multiple strokes before my flight, I started to become incredibly anxious about the flight and the study abroad trip. One night we were talking about intimate topics, and after me sharing some sensitive information with her about my past trauma and sexual preferences, she tells me she does not feel comfortable with sharing anything like that with me. And after this, I had a bit of a panic attack and stated “if you cannot be physically, emotionally or sexually intimate with me I do not think this relationship is going to work”.

For context, my ex was from an extremely conservative North African country, and had a history of being emotionally abused and harassed by men. She was extremely reluctant to open up to me, I wished to help her but she never would tell me if something was bothering her or come to me for help. Whenever I did something wrong she would shut down and ignore me for a few hours or even days.

Which was exactly her response after our conversation, she accused me of only wanting to have sex, and promptly started to ignore me. On valentines day, I asked her for her address for a surprise (send her flowers) and asked to go on a video call, she just told me to leave her alone. I text her a week later, a few days before the flight, to which she replies “cancel the flight :)”. We talk a bit longer, she accuses me of trying to stalk her because I asked for her address days prior. Eventually, she does calm down a little and apologizes, but she still wants to breakup.

I can’t help but both feel extremely angry due to her ignoring me right up until I couldn’t get a refund for a flight, as well as the accusations. But I also feel guilty because I did threaten the relationship because she refused intimacy with me, during a panic attack. I feel like it’s mostly her fault but I share a large portion of the guilt.

2022-06-09 04:55:01,10,False,12,"Hi reddit, first time posting in this sub so I hope I do this right. I (m22) have had a really rough time for a while now. I recently graduated uni and its been a shitshow. I can't find work in my field, I've had to move back in with my mom (our relationship isnt the best), I'm stuck working 2 shitty minimum wage jobs just to get by, and I've had to move back to my hometown where I have to be in the closet the whole time (I'm trans.) For context I went to uni in a major city where I could be out without worry. 

Most of my friends all stayed in the city as they all either found jobs in their field or come from wealthy families that are footing the bill for both college and their apartments. After returning home, I've all but been isolated from them and have seen them all posting about expensive European tours and fancy new apartments, and its by and large taken a big toll on me mentally. I've felt like a failure and a mistake for picking the field I did, and feel generally depressed for having to be stuck in an unpleasant and transphobic environment 24/7. 

I have been trying to stay off socials for this reason, but I still feel a bit upset from time to time, and without the financial ability to seek therapy, I've had to handle this on my own and do at home care (breathing exercises, journaling, drawing etc.) It's obviously not the best system but its what I can afford. Onto my friend though.

""Erin"" (m21) has known me for about 8 years, and in that time we've been pretty close, although I'll admit he would often contact me to talk about his issues with his girlfriend, or how multiple of his friendships would fail. He has a history of having friends suddenly ghost/block him, and he sometimes stalks their socials and finds them shit talking him and complains to me about it. I've tried to help him multiple times and he's seemed to get better but I can tell he still has a few similar habits. Because he talks to me about these things I thought I could be honest with him about how I was feeling. We chatted a bit tonight through text and he kept telling me about his gf and how he's hoping to get a cat soon and hes having a great time in his apartment, when I told him I was sorry but I think I couldn't really handle hearing all of this right now. I basically told him that due to my situation currently, and nothing of his own personal accord, I was having trouble really communicating with people about life stuff. I just had been going through a lot and have felt like a failure, and I just didn't think now was a good time to talk about this stuff, and maybe in a bit when I felt more secure. 

He got pretty upset and said ""well im sorry you feel like that, but if hearing about my life makes you that upset maybe you need help and should just deal with this alone."" I apologized several times to him for the inconvenience and left him alone after that.

But I can literally listen to him vent about the same 3 things for hours everyday, I probably can only talk about how I feel maybe once a week for and hour and if it’s about him and how he makes me feel he’ll get upset and block me(22F)on all social media. I’d later tell him how I feel about our fight and try to fix our problems and then politely ask if he could unblock me. I looked up his social media (unknowingly) on google publicly to see his page &amp; it says he’s single in all his info. Days maybe even weeks will go by and I’ll still be blocked &amp; when I ask him to unblock me he’ll say “ I’ll do it when im ready, you’re just tryna look for drama, I’m trying to control him, im insecure and that im unstable in many ways.” Which hurts cause he knows I have a anxiety disorder. My bf has cheated on me in the past OPENLY ON SOCIAL MEDIA TOO! and says that he has never done it again and truly acts like he’s deeply in love with me. But with the way he invalidates my feelings all the time It obviously makes me feel like it’ll happen again or is already. I then go on to repeat that im not trying to control him but if im mentioning some things that make me feel uncomfortable I would Atleast want reassurance if he’s not going to compromise with me. He then says “I’ll hang up nd block you too if you keep stressing me out, you’re always looking for something to fight about &amp; if it’s a problem you can just break up with me”. I keep telling him I’m not trying to control him In anyway I just want some reassurance. He continues to gaslight me on how he made me feel and how his actions DOESNT affect our relationship… I replied with “I’m honestly done being manipulated and gaslight by you all the time. Im not gonna be with someone who can’t reassure me, who keeps invalidating my feelings, consistently blocking me, and making me think that he’s sneaking around. You’ve proved to me ONCE AGAIN that social media is more important than me in this relationship.” I then told him to never text or call me again and get rid of everything that reminds him of me cause I’m sick and tired of this cycle &amp; I’m honestly done with Him.

Takes me out, comes to see me even though we're in different cities and is even planning on introducing me to his family this week. I just moved to this state not even two months ago so I'm still trying to find work, so I can spoil him as much as he does me. 
However, everytime we sit and talk about if we want to make things official he always says no. I understand partly because things are still pretty fresh, but we are already exclusive and I've tried my hardest to make him see I'm worth it. We are very different and he always tells me he's never dated someone like me before but maybe we're too different? Everything he's asked me to improve on I'm trying to do. When we first started seeing each other I didn't text him as often as he liked but since we discussed it I text him multiple times a day (as he does me). I even started going to the gym with him (not because he doesn't like my body but because I don't like my body). 
Everytime we discuss what a relationship would be like he tells me that I would probably have to do a 180 in how I live because he doent want that lifestyle. (I've been single for a while by choice and liked the bar scene but i dont want that anymore) This isn't really a problem for me because I've already been working on living a different lifestyle then I was previously before I met him. I feel like I'm constantly trying to prove myself and hope he gives me benefit of doubt like I give him. He's been honest about his cheating in previous relationships with his two ex wife's, but he pays child support for his 4 children. We all make mistakes so I dont want to hold that against him. 
I'm also bisexual but am not interested in being poly or anything and he agrees but I can't even compliment a girls pretty dress without him thinking I want to get with her. I've been very honest about my previous lifestyle and I used to have threesomes and im kind of kinky but that hasn't been a thing for a very long time. I think maybe I'm to comfortable with my sexuality around him and it makes him uncomfortable. I don't blame him for being hesitant about that, but I feel like he already doent trust me even though I always reassure him that he's enough for me. 
Today after the gym we talked about being offical again but he kept dropping the word ""if"" a lot. Like ""if"" we become official and ""if"" we work out. I hurt eveytime he said ""if"". I've already told him that I want him and only him and I know I'm the only girl he's seeing. Am I expecting things to happen too soon?

She always supported me with everything, I could talk to her about anything ever, and she would do her best to guide me through life. I was planning to move to Italy, where she used to live. I could write a whole book about her personality, but I am choosing to sum it up to ""she was an amazing person"".



She was hit by a car back in January, when she was visiting my hometown, and it happened right in front of me, I was the witness. The car made her spin through the air before eventually falling on her head on a concrete block. There was blood everywhere, she could barely breathe, and couldn't talk at all. I knew she wouldn't make it. I was shocked to the point where I was denying what I had just witnessed with my own eyes. In my hometown, she had a house next door to where I lived, and there is a crosswalk a few meters away from the house. I wanted to visit her, so I called her. She told me she went grocery shopping and that she'll be home in 5 minutes so I went to her house and was waiting for her outside. She was crossing the street on the crosswalk, and I swear, I was staring right at her when the car hit her and flew her into the air.




When the emergency medical services arrived, they took her to the nearest hospital, where she was diagnosed with severe brain damage and several broken bones. I was also on the ambulance ride, and at the hospital, where the doctor gave her a verry low chance of survival, and told me that even if she does survive, the highest chances are that she will live the rest of her short life as a brainless vegetable. I hadn't slept at all that night and spent the following day thinking about her and processing what had happened. She was in a coma for 3 months before eventually passing.




I wanted her to die, ironically out of the love I had for her, and I am happy that she didn't have to suffer as a  vegetable. I'm not happy that she's not here anymore, but i am happy that wherever she is now, she probably has more freedom than if she were a vegetable here. I believe that being in a vegetative state (and mindless on top of it) is a fate worse than death.




Of course, I still miss her. At least once every week, I still get this recurring dream where my brain keeps replaying the memory of the crash that killed her, and I would rather have her here right now, but I would never want her to be bedbound and unable to think or do or say anything for the rest of her life.

I asked her if she'd was looking for something in the bedroom, and if I could help her find it. She replied with ""no, why would I go in your bedroom?"" And then changed the subject.

My maternal grandfather, whom I considered a close friend as well as a role model passed earlier this month at 93 years young. He was an inspiration to everyone he knew, and we all loved him dearly. 

My mom’s sister decided she wants photos and video taken of the visitation, memorial service and following reception being held in honor of his life. So, she’s “nominated” my uncle to be the photographer. 

I view these services as a private time to grieve my loss, and refused to have my picture taken when requested. My refusal was met with frustration and confusion.

I travel for work and have the privilege of being able to control my own work calendar, so I always make time to find great independent coffee shops so I can try their roasts. It's a wonderful perk of my job. When I'm home, there's a cute coffee shop I go to that has a great vibe, strong wifi and plenty of seating. 

Last month, a new barista (28M) starting working there and we struck up a conversation about various roasts. They're offering a delicious Ethiopian single origin on pourover and he wanted me to try it. He brought me my coffee and while I was sipping it, we struck up a conversation. I can't explain it, but I felt like I was lost in his eyes. He was blushing and smiling and kept asking questions that were obviously worded to find out about my relationship status (single) and sexuality (gay). 

Before I left, he asked if I wanted to come to a cupping at the shop that was closed to the public and I agreed. After the cupping, we went outside and ended up walking around the neighborhood. Our hands brushed and he sighed a few times, then he shyly asked, ""Hey, you wanna hang out sometime?"" I told him I'd love that and the next day we hung out at my place. Nothing sexual happened, but later we drove to the shore of the Outer Banks and parked so we could see the water and I never felt more enamored with someone. 

Since then he's spent the night quite a few times and we've gone on long drives. We haven't done anything sexual aside from kissing, but we hold hands and cuddle in bed. He's asked if I wanted to have sex and told me he does, but I'm hesitating because he's special to me. What I can't decide is if he's special to me because I care about him as a friend with potential benefits, or if I'm experiencing something more meaningful. And beyond all that, it feels wrong in a way. We're in two different stations of life and I feel like going any further has the potential to make a mess.

It all started after I broke up with my boyfriend, we will call him J, for the first time back in late December because my overthinking was terrible. When I came back to school, I had realised he had become best friends with my ex-bestfriend (we will call her M) and it sounds so pathetic because I am only a teenager and this stuff happens but it was worse knowing that they spread rumours about me being a whore. This was cuz he was arguing with me at some point and I, quickly and out of nowhere said: ""I want to be a whore."" 

I didn't mean it I just didn't know how to get him off my back.

Well anyways, after it felt like it was me against the world from January to the end of March, I've developed deep trust issues and my brain can't stop thinking? I guess?  And the thoughts are normally only bad. I made up with J at the end of March and in April had a birthday party with him and some close friends (B, V, S) plus J, V's cousin and S's boyfriend, O. Life was actually pretty great so I denied the fact that I had any sort of mental issues and it was just a one off thing.

But now they're back and worse than ever.

Me and J fell in love all over again, and started dating. However, I broke up with him again because we constantly argued and those arguments brought back those thoughts. Not to mention, I found M and him joke-flirting and I just felt sick. We broke up around 3 weeks ago and around 3 days ago I found out M and J are dating.

Again, I feel so pathetic speaking about this because this is only teenlife but, every little thing feels targeted at me. I feel like everyone hates me and I dread school. My trust issues only have gotten worse and I constantly feel sick.

But I was telling my parents about it and about how I wasn't doing well at all, and how it's affecting me and my learning, even bringing up anxiety at some point and they passed it off as ""No, it's just school stress."" Proceeding with ""anxiety and depression is a stupid thing Americans made up to control you"".

2022-09-15 19:08:55,2,False,1,"I (18F) feel like he is no longer interested in me.
We have been in a long-distance relationship for over a year and a half, but before that we had already known each other for more than three years. Everything was going well, since we met we became best friends with many things in common, he (18M) always seemed to me someone interesting, intelligent, handsome and funny, he still is, and I have always shown him that I love him and how important he is in my life even if there is a long distance between us. He has been for me when I needed him the most, and i've always been there for him whenever he needs me through rough situations.
However, for months I've felt that things have been changing, he talks less and less, our conversations feel monotonous and I always have to be the one to bring up the conversation, sometimes he doesn't even seem to make an effort or is too distracted to even answer. He usually play videogames and spend time with friends o going out a lot, sometimes I see him spend a long time in discord on a vc with his friends, and I always think that it's good. I always encourage him to spend time with his friends and have fun, have a good time, I always tell him that the most important thing for me is that he can feel good. But I would like to be able to be part of those good times as his girlfriend too, even a little, I don't want to be intrusive or rude o controlling, I just want to spend some time with my boyfriend.
He never usually tells me about the things he does until a long time after doing them, if I don't ask him about things he doesn't tell me anything, he only starts the conversation when it's already late, when he's bored and tired and remembers that I exist. I feel like I'm just always in the background for him, that I'm just something that is there until he remembers my existence, until he remembers that he has a girlfriend who patiently waits for him every day so we can have a 20-minute conversation before he falls asleep or forgets to answer until the next day.
I don't know what to do. I'm tired. I'm no longer a priority in this relationship. I'm always in the background no matter how hard I try to get his attention, show him that I love him and try to make him show the same. I just want him to make an effort, I want for once not to be the only one who has to send messages to try to remind him of me, I just want to feel that he's still interested in me, I just want to be part of his life again the same as it was a few months ago. If I don't text him, he could easily just forget that I'm there for days and days, and that hurts me a lot.
I already told him a month ago that I wanted to break up because of all this, I told him how I hurt I feel and how sad I am, but he convinced me that he would get better, that he would learn to pay more attention to the relationship and ""take care of what he loves"", that he made a mistake and that it would not happen again. He said that he loves me truly and don't want to lose me. But nothing changed. He hasn't made an effort, we even talk a lot less now, and although I understand him since he just started college, he doesn't tell me anything, he barely responds with two or three messages a day, and I'm too tired to keep trying. I just want to know if he's ok, if he likes his university, if he feels good. I don't want him to spend all the day with me, I just want to know how's is he doing. I can't tell him how's my day going, I can't mention how I feel. If something good or bad happen to me I know it's useless go tell him, because he's not there, and I feel that every time I tell him something, he's not even interested, he doesn't even respond sometimes.
I feel like I just need to stop being the only one struggling with this. If I doesn't send messages, or photos, or audios, or videos, if I don't even remind him that I'm there, he probably won't realize it. I think he doesn't care about me like before, and I don't want to continue being in the background. I love him, but I don't know what to do anymore, I'm tired and hurt by all this. What else can I do? Maybe I'm not enough. Maybe is something wrong with me. Maybe I'm just too selfish wanting to demand more time from him, but I just want to be part of his life like before. I always take the relationships to serios, even if we are young, maybe that's my problem.
What I can do in this situation?

I'm a product researcher for a Dubai based, remote, mental health product. I have a Clinical Psychology background, but it doesn't pay well where I live. It made sense to opt for a product role.  


The story begins with my manager's pettiness. She has no background in mental health, yet she consistently micromanaged me and other researchers. She makes sure we look incompetent, and treats us like students. 

If you stand up to her, you're done for.

Here's an example - She asked me, extremely rudely, why my output was less for the week. 

Now generally, she'd expect me to apologize, feel guilty, and walk on eggshells. I was sick of doing that for 8 months! So I assertively told her I was on a leave for a day which affected my output. Nothing wrong with this, right? Well a couple of weeks later, she gave me a shitty appraisal.

There'd been incidents like this with everyone, not just me. 

Now for the story. In March, the company was struggling with their UX flow.  I have a bit of a background in the UX research area, so I was able to come up with some ideas. At that point of time, they did not appreciate me. But then my manager began to pressurize me to leave the content team and be a UX person for them. ""It's totally your choice, of course,"" she used to say.

My last appraisal was today. She began the meeting with asking me what I think about doing the UX work. I said it excites me, sure, but right now I'm happy with being a content researcher and would be happier in the role I signed up for. She then said, ""I'm sorry but you're not the right fit for us as a researcher or a writer anymore.""

I was shell shocked. I did not know where this was coming from. We had a couple of ""disagreements"" this month (very small ones, like the example I mentioned above. I didn't know I'd stepped on her ego) and I knew she was acting in vengeance. She told me that a UX agency would be extremely expensive for them, so it makes sense that I would go in that area, since I have prior knowledge and knew the product inside-out. And if I chose otherwise, then it's best I search for a new role as I no longer fit with the company.

I was shocked, outraged. I told her this was unfair, this was horrible, that I never saw this coming. I told her I'd be excited to learn UX but how would it affect the company if I was being threatened to move into another team?  She said, ""oh no please don't take this decision out of some threat. This is totally your choice. I don't want anyone to take such decisions out of threat. It would affect our work.""

She then made it sound like I should be grateful they weren't firing me, but giving me another chance to prove myself. No amount of disagreements made any difference; the company was decided.

Reddit, how does it make sense that they're forcing me to shift to another department when I never signed up for such a role? Oh, the cherry on top is that my pay would not increase in the UX area despite it being a tech role. I am so so upset about this. I've been crying non stop. I feel jaded. I gave so much of my time to the mental health area, so much of energy to building this promising product. 

I'm confident I'll find a new gig, but the disrespect is something I can't get over.

My friends and boyfriend are suggesting me to take the UX gig on the surface to buy time, and find a new gig till then, before dropping them without notice. I agree with them, but I can't imagine facing her again for anything.

Unfortunately my clases became online due to Covid. Around Spring 2022, I started to loose some motivation in school and would often procrastinate on my stuff, yet I always did my best to turn in my assignments on time leaving me to cram in my work, obviously my fault. During that time, I would tell my bf that I’m busy with school work since I am an aspiring animator. And it would happen to the point where I would pull all nighters often. Becaue of this, my bf would accuse me that I’m talking to other men around my university and not actually doing my work. I kept reassuring him that nothing is happening and I really haven’t made any friends at school besides my roommate.

It’s a new semester for me and I am close on graduating. I am taking 6 classes this semester, 2 of them are in person which require a lot of out of class hours since one is ceramics and the other is painting. The past few days I have been trying my best to catch up on my assignments since I ended up getting Covid a week after classes have started leaving me to isolate. 

Yesterday he asked me where have I been going yet he has my location on for safety purposes and yet this isn’t the first time he has done this.. 2 days ago, I went to ceramics to work on one of my projects and afterwards went to the store which is downstairs on my apartment to grab something to drink. Yesterday, I went to class and afterwards went to ceramics to finish one of my assignments, went to dorms to drop off some things and went to eat with my roommate and went to publix afterwards to look for some flowers for some personal reasons. Earlier, I went to pick up a package downstairs from amazon since we have a mail area in the dorms. Yesterday night, he spoke to me over the phone while I was walking back to dorms with my roomate and I literally told him it was my roommate (F19/20), twice. He messaged me asking again who did I go with. From there I realized he doesn't trust me at all. He said he cant keep doing this.

My husband has family in both US and elsewhere in Asia and his dad and bro has not met my 3yr old or his other 7yr old nephew.

We also decided to travel to meet my besties of 30yrs because everyone in the group would be reunited in Dubai. So we asked if his family would like to also come to Dubai so we cld kill 2 birds with 1 stone. I wld spend 5days with friends, 5days with in laws in Dubai and then fly to Bali to me my side of the family for 4 days.

My locals friends and cousins which I'm close to will be more available in December with their kids (schools hols + many of my friends are teachers cos I was one too) so meeting them for play dates etc will be tougher in Jan.

2022-01-04 18:07:21,8,False,4,"I’m a 22 yr old female. I was never really a paranoid person, but these past 4-6 months I’ve seem to develop panic attacks and when I have them there is this overwhelming feeling of extreme paranoia as if I’m going to die any second for any variety of reasons. It usually hits me in the evening and or right before bed. 

It truly scares me. I try to call a friend or family member when it happens but no one has been able to help calm me down during this strange episode in fact the opposite, so I now just stay to myself when it happens despite the extreme fear. Since they’ve never experienced it before, it makes them angry and upset which can make my anxiety go through the roof even more. I try to pray it out but then feels like I’m about to pass out. 

What could be going on can anyone relate? It’s honestly terrifying and I’m open to whatever needs to be done to stop it. There were a few nights I rlly felt the only way to stop it was to end things. It makes me feel crazy when it’s happening like I can’t control my own thoughts and mind. Once before Idk how I kept from sho*ting myself in the head. Idk how I get through it each time it happens. But I noticed it’s becoming more frequent. I try to talk myself down but makes me more paranoid trying to drown it out.

Only thing I can relate the feeling to is this one time I was strung out on too much THC and this same paranoia kicked in that I had never felt before. It was like I was possessed it was so awful. The feeling is so similar but without the THC and cotton mouth!!! Like damn if I’m going to feel same at least let it be bc I’m smoking not bc I’m just trying to relax and go to sleep or do laundry 🤦🏻‍♀️. 

Only major life changes I would say have affected me mentally was a devastating breakup. But that was back in idk June or July I guess. It still hurts if I think about it but other than that my life has improved if anything and I never experienced anything like this before. I did notice for awhile I was having bad even traumatic flashbacks reliving some memories of that relationship that I kept locked away and that would make me feel depressed but I began to control that. Now all a sudden I’m having these awful panic attacks my heart rate shoot’s up I feel dizzy and paranoia sets in to the max and feels like my heart will stop. It’s mostly mental though and this feeling in my head is nearly unbearable when it happens. 

It’s starting to get in the way of my life I never know when it’s gonna hit.

I’m also a healthy person in general I’m active I eat right and various food groups I drink a lot of hot tea different kinds which I’ve done for years. I don’t rlly do drugs or drink. I did start sh a little bit which in a weird way felt was helping but then I didn’t trust myself not to go too far so I’ve been weening myself off that. Maybe it started after that? Idk. 

Does anyone know how to stop this feeling? It’s starting to ruin my evenings I was making pasta last night and didn’t even get to eat it the feeling was too strong I had to try and lay down.

My partner and I live together and we are not married.  We have been together for seven years.  The first six and a half years we were poly-amorous and living separately, we discussed living options for an entire year and eventually moved into a house together with my other partner.  We had no designated primary or secondary.  This went south, they ended up hating one another, the other partner and I broke up and she moved out of state. My remaining partner and I are now exclusive for the first time ever.  The last few months I have been depressed over the loss of my other relationship and frustrated by the adjustments to my life.  We are having trouble connecting emotionally and sexually.

We went for a walk to discuss this, I took inventory of how I felt, what my needs were and what role I saw her playing in my life.  She was not able to do the same and told me her emotional core was in hibernation, the strain from living with my other partner made it necessary for her to emotionally deaden herself in order to stay in the relationship.  This was a significant bombshell for me, we speak frequently about how we are feeling and this is the first I was hearing of this, I had no idea this was happening at the time and asked her why she would stay if things were so bad for her.  She became very angry saying that she knew I would say that if she wasn't happy she should just leave and she was right.  Beyond that she said it should take roughly six months for her to destress and find her feelings for me again, she is concerned I will not be willing to wait.  My  jaw was on the floor.  

So acknowledging that I'm the asshole for not reading her more accurately, we are currently living in a rental house with a year left on the lease and her brother has moved in to pick up the financial slack of the other woman leaving.  The emotional relationship seems like it's basically over, I would like to connect with her again but I'm not even sure we're capable of that at this point.  

I was debating on giving  her the master bedroom, moving into the office and ending the emotional relationship until the lease runs out, which should give her, her brother and her son time to find somewhere else to live without significant pressure.  If they want to leave sooner I can always find renters for their areas of the house to accommodate a tighter timeline, which I'm more than happy to do.

Sometime back in 2010 I left a 5 year relationship and moved into my first place on my own, and I was lonely so I started a POF account. I talked to a few guys but only became texting and Facebook friends with one let's call him Jay and ended up in a 3 year relationship with another. Jay and I started as flirty but both ended up dating others so we were friends and a listing ear if the other needed. We hadn't met in person so after about 4 years and a few uneventful relationships on his part and the one that didn't work out for me we decided to finally hang out. My intentions have always been clear and he knows that I want a relationship. We hung out daily and got even closer emotionally, and about 6 months later we dated for all of 2 months . His ex came back and he said he was sorry and how he thought he was over her but he might want to take her back. I was obviously crushed and we stopped talking for 3 months, you know enough time for her to play him again and for him to start sending me texts asking for advice or venting. They called it quits after that. 

So they have been broken up for 2 years now, he's been ""working on his mental health"" and we have been hanging out almost daily since and even went on a 5 day road trip this past summer. On this trip we had sex, just once and didn't touch or kiss aside from that. We have only had sex two other times and that was way back when we dated and the just after the trip we went to on a weekend trip. So my problem is this, he kisses me daily and we go everywhere together but every time I say I want to be in a relationship or even bring it up he says he's still trying to get his head right/work on himself and this has been the same for years.

Furthermore, when you're planning a campaign, come up with an escalation plan. This is a plan where you ask nicely at first so that when you escalate to more extreme forms of direct action, you can go to the press and say ""We were forced to do this because we asked nicely and the university refused, so we had to do this."" They will DARVO (deny, attack, reverse victim and offender), but creating this 'reasonable person forced to unreasonable action by mean employer' plays well to the press.

Finally, be cognizant of your legislative session. You want to make sure that the state legislature will not be in session or at least not able to introduce bills near the time you're expecting your campaign to peak.

2022-01-22 18:15:30,425,False,1684,"I (NB 19) am autistic and one of the things that I simply cannot handle are raindrops. The overstimulation of rain falling on me is one of the very few situations where I feel like my disability actually impairs me in my day-to-day life. Because of that, I very frequently leave the house with a very big umbrella. Even if it's sunny outside, if there's even a smidge of a chance that it will rain, I'm bringing my large umbrella (it's an expensive Golfer umbrella, these are usually the largest ones you can find. It straps to my back like a backpack.). My girlfriend (F 20) often makes fun of me for carrying an umbrella almost half my size (has a 1.20m diameter when opened) even when the sun is shining bright, but I don't pay her mind. I'd rather be safe and dry than sorry and wet. Raindrops are a big no-no. 

Anyway. Few days ago, I was out with my girlfriend and since it was a date and I wanted to look good I decided to not take my wonky giant umbrella but instead a smaller one. As always, sun was shining bright. Not a single cloud in the sky. We hung out for a bit in a shopping mall (and she commented on my need to have an umbrella even on a sunny day and when we're mostly staying inside). When we were leaving the mall, however, it was raining a lot. A lot a lot. These kinds of situations are why I bring an umbrella with me at all times. The thing is, as soon as I opened my umbrella, she wanted to stay under it too. I usually wouldn't have a problem if I had my golfer umbrella with me, but sadly, I only had my tiny one. It was barely enough to cover my whole body (I'm 6'3) when I'm alone, so it wouldn't serve for anything if we were both under it. We would both be completely wet. I explained to her that it only makes sense if only one of us is under it. I argued that I should have it because I'm always the one who makes sure to come prepared and that my autism does not mix well with heavy rain, but she got really upset that I let her stay in the rain when I had an umbrella. She took an uber home and hasn't texted me back ever since.

Edit: I should clarify that she did try to argue that we both fit under the umbrella, but I don’t think we do. As I said, it still feels too small even when I’m by myself.

Yeah, you guys are right. Complete L on both of our parts to not think of that. In my defence, rain stresses me and it’s hard to think, but that’s something so simple I’m a bit embarrassed I didn’t think of that even with the sensory overload.

My partner of 4.5 years and I live with his family since mid 2020. I contribute to the rent, and I used to cover his as well until he started refusing it. I will make just under $100k this year, and he works at takeout of a restaurant with minimum wage and tips. 

When I graduated university, I immediately started working and would be gone 10 hours a day. Intuitively, I had the feeling he was going to things like OF and Snapchat to exchange messages/pictures/videos with people. All this despite me honestly fulfilling him whenever I was home, daily. This was costing him a good portion of money. At one point, I received a text from him while at work in early September that he messed up and was in trouble. A ""woman"" from Snapchat received a nude from him with his face in it and was blackmailing him using info gained from his IP address for lots of money. He sent an initial fund but on my advice blocked her, and it ended there. I didn't make a point of shoving his mistake in his face, and just asked once that he don't do it again considering his money situation.

Mid September, I snooped after a suspicious notification and noticed text messages with a stranger asking for apple pay etc. and him abiding. I was shocked. After the blackmailing incident. By this point he was pretty broke but still sent over money. (I know he needs psychological help and I'm trying to get him it.)

Since then he saw a few paycheck totals dwindle due to catching COVID. Even so he asked me to stop paying his portion of rent. I pleaded to help him out but eventually stepped back (I have covered every other expense given our difference in income).

Recently I picked up more hours at work, and he wasn't jumping to be intimate so I knew he was talking to people. He doesn't like when I discuss money (I only do so when I feel it's needed. I never use finances to guilt him, manipulate him, or anything of that matter.) So I went with a very gentle approach. I pretty much said ""Honey, I know things have been a little tight with rent and things. Can I just ask that you refrain from paying to talk to or see women? I'm not arrogant about it but I think it's fair to say I satisfy you a lot. And I'm sorry but your money could go to better things than people who see you as dollar signs. I just think it'd be smart not to do it again."" I was careful to be delicate in tone and not make him feel bad. 

He got pissed. He said it's his money to do whatever he wants with and I shouldn't tell him how to spend it. He said I was like his mom, scoffed, dismissed me, and didn't talk to me for an hour. I realize I shouldn't tell him how to spend his paychecks, but it was more of a hopeful suggestion trying to look out for him.

2022-03-13 23:23:33,2,False,1,"TL;DR: I (28 M) don’t know if I should ask an old friend out (27 F) again because I’ve done it before and it hasn’t happened, even though the way she acts with me makes me think I should try again.

So, there’s this girl I’ve known for over 10 years. We used to be really close back in the day, I used to talk to her and go to her place all the time, and we were great friends. About 5 years ago, we drifted apart, I got a gf and she got a bf, and life took us on different paths.

I hadn’t seen her since then until about a year and a half ago, when a mutual friend invited me to hang out at her place, and we got to talking again. I had always been attracted to this girl, but I never really pursued her when we were friends. I got her number and we got to talking.

A few months later, me and the gf I had for the past 5 years broke up, and I decided to ask this girl out. She accepted and we went on a date and we had a lot of fun. There was a moment where I could’ve made a move, but I didn’t. I guess I was still too used to being with my ex that I didn’t know how to be with anyone else.

Now, after that, I asked her out again a few weeks later (right after our date, my city went into lockdown for 8 weeks), but she was going on a trip, and told me that she did want to see me but after she came back.

I have a lot of anxiety when it comes to doing these kind of things, so I had to talk myself into asking her out again, because I really liked her, despite a nagging feeling inside of me that told me that she wasn’t interested in going out with me again and that she was just making up excuses.

So I did, I asked her out for a third time, and she told me that that Saturday (which is when we would’ve gone out) she wasn’t sure if she had to attend rehearsals for her sister’s (she is also an old friend of mine) wedding and that she would “let me know.”

I took this as the final test: if she indeed “let me know” and we went out that day, or perhaps even rescheduled for another day, then I would know for sure that she was definitely interested in me. If she didn’t say anything or tried to play dumb, I would take it as lack of interest and move on.

Well, she didn’t tell me anything that day, and I took it as a lack of interest and moved on. And she took notice. Suddenly, she was texting me regularly, telling me we should take another trip (like we used to when we were really close all those years ago), checking my IG stories religiously… 

But I never asked her out again. A few months after that, I finally finished a project I was working on and I wanted to show it to my friends - her included. So I asked her to come to my apartment, hang out with our friends (they’re her friends too), check out this project, and maybe we’d drink a couple of beers after that.

Around this time I also lost my phone, so I didn’t have a phone for about a month, and I could only talk to this girl whenever I logged onto IG from my PC, which was almost never. 

I sent her the address to my place and told her the date and time. She asked if she could bring somebody, but I didn’t want any strangers, so I told her that the invitation was only for her. 

She never replied. 

She didn’t show up that day, and I took it as yet another sign that I should just move on from this girl. A few weeks later she actually replied wondering if the event I was planning had taken place after all. But this time it was me who didn’t reply.

Then I went on to premiere my project on a prestigious indie movie theater in my city and I didn’t invite her. I posted some pics of the event on my social media, to which she replied that I had never told her the time or place. 

I’ve been pretty distant with her ever since, though she has tried to reach out to me, she’s replied to a few of my IG stories, and been checking them religiously. But I don’t reciprocate, and I kind of feel bad about it. I don’t know if I’m maybe taking things the wrong way.

Tomorrow is her birthday, and it also marks one year since we went out, and I haven’t seen her since. I was thinking of sending her a happy birthday message, and then telling her we should go on that trip we talked about a while back. 

I really do like this girl, and I haven’t quite managed to take her out of my mind, but I don’t want to ask her out again only to be shot down, again.

He is the only boy I’ve ever dated, the only boy I’ve ever kissed, etc. Before we even started talking I had a crush on him for years. And I think that because of that, I let him treat me badly at the start. Back around 2 years ago, there was some drama with his ex girlfriend, and i won’t explain it all, but he treated me very badly, and he knows it. What he doesn’t know was how badly he affected my self esteem. I’ve never been confident before, but because of the things he said/did at that time, there were a few months were I couldn’t even look in the mirror without crying. It was the lowest my self esteem has ever been in my life. Looking back at that time, i keep thinking I should have broken up with him, i don’t know why I stayed with him after he made me feel so terrible. But that was 2 years ago. Now, he constantly compliments me, several times a day. But i never believe a word he says, because of how he made me feel those 2 years ago. I don’t know if I’m ever going to get over that insecurity he made me feel, if it still affects me so much today. He gets upset when I don’t accept any of his compliments, but i can’t bring myself to tell him why I don’t believe him.
There have been other issues in our relationship, but they haven’t affected me as much as that. I don’t know if that is a valid reason to break up with a boy who loves me so much, and who I THINK wouldn’t ever treat me badly again.

He started talking to me about how he wants to do something special when it comes to our 5 year anniversary, and it really scared me.

My girlfriend and I had been looking to hire a maid for our reasonably sized house (1400 square feet) for a long time. 

She recently stumbled on a few instagram posts and she chose a maid. She discussed with her what she did and they talked about spring cleaning (windows and w/e, hence more than regular cleaning). She made a mistake in not clearly agreeing to specific task, nor did she discuss an hourly rate. 

The maid indicated it should be around 300$ for spring cleaning. The made arrived around noon, cleaned for roughly 4 hours and 20 minutes. She was clearly working and she did not take a break that I’ve seen, so seemed to have a very good work ethic as far as I can tell.

My gf indicated to me they hadn’t agreed on a price and I had to leave to go get my older son at daycare. I already felt this was going to be a disaster ( at that time I wasn’t aware of anything in their agreement).

As my gf had to make the baby nap, the maid indicated that she would text my gf for the price for a transfer since she probably would be done while the baby was sleeping.

Fast forward an hour later, the maid texts my girlfriend that it would be 425$. My gf was about to pay as I said there is no way we are paying that much for a maid that spent 4 hours alone at my place. She then explained the situation, and I agreed based on the exchanges we had to pay 300$ (even if overpriced).

The maid disagreed with my gf. My gf was getting emotional thus I grabbed the phone and called her. She was initially very agressive in tone and wasn’t interested in anything but getting paid the full amount she felt she was due. I was very stoic and gave her two option, she either accepts 300$ or she can sue me for what she feels I owe her.

Ensued a very emotional breakup from said maid which wasn’t fun for anyone, she said I was trying to steal from her, she cried, it wasn’t fun. At the end she agreed to receive the 250$ since my gf already paid 50$.

My gf is really thorn by this and feels bad to the point she wants to give the money to the maid. 

I should point out we aren’t super wealthy per say but my salary probably puts me in the 1% of earners, so paying her an extra 125$ would make no difference for us monetarily 

AITA?

Edit for clarity: she was alone working, effectively asking for 100$/hour which was never clarified between my gf and her.

Edit #2: a lot of people are saying it’s a fair price for a spring clean so I just want to clarify. She did a normal clean and also cleaned interior windows. Nothing else in the house was cleaned or moved. Just adding extra information if people are trying to assess whether it’s fair value.

Edit #3: after discussing with my girlfriend we’ve decided to pay the 125$, solely based on the fact that even though it’s overpriced for the services, it was her responsibility to clarify with the maid. Not because we make money and she doesn’t or w/e. We’ve specified to the maid that we hope she wasn’t taking advantage of us, even though it feels like it.

This opinion is a big experience i had to make over the years and it is obnoxious as hell.

Maybe you feel the same.

Everyone of us propably knows at least 1 or 2 people from youve heard that their work condition or pay is abyssmal but instead of trying to change it by talking to their contractor or company they rather try to talk themself out of it, if one does say their concerns about it.

I take an example from my worklife.

I work as a security guard. My company has a good name in public but is in reality pretty harsh in their pay/work relations to their employees.

It is a fact that is widely known to most of us. And we dont hold back by telling this to newer employees.

So i have a colleague whom i really like by his personality. But he works for our company for 6 years now and still hadnt a single raise in his pay, which is even for my companies standart abnormal.

So i asked him if he ever tried to talk to one of our supervisiors about it.

He said no.

\-Our Pay would be fine.

Then the real arguments were brought to the surface:

\-Hes already 43 years old, what if they kick him out of the companie for asking such a question.

\-Nobody else would take him because of his age.

\-What does it even matter to me, its his life and not my own.

And so on.

Usually i stop arguing when i hear such bullshit argmuments but i really wanted this guy to have a better work life relation, otherwise he would run straight to a burnout wall he will propably not escape. (Happend to many of my colleagues, they were just... broken)

It endet by me trying talking sense into him, (i worked before corona as an office clerk and i know how our work laws in our country work) that he should at least try it. Which he blocked until to this day.

I was annoyed because I like to keep the door open so I don't feel so disconnected from the rest of the house while I work all day and we have 3 pets that need be able to come in and out. I yelled after him to not shut the door and leave it open. He ""didn't hear me"" so I had to get up myself and open it, then I confronted him asking why he closed the door when he knows I like to keep it open. He said because he doesn't want to look at me and he doesn't want me to look at him right now. That seems irrelevant because my back faces the door while I'm at my desk so I'm not looking at him and our door faces a hallway so you can't even see into other rooms where he would be. Basically we can avoid looking at each other without having the door closed. Through this whole conversation he made sure to avoid looking at me even though I was obviously looking at him (because that's what you do when you are talking to someone!).

2022-06-08 15:22:09,11,False,1,"Hi everyone,

I have an awkward situation and to preface I am ""functioning autistic""(was called aspergers until we stopped saying that). I am a regular at a restaurant. I'm in a small town that only has about 7 restaurants and there is a clear best so I am there like 3-4 days a week.

One of the waitresses/hostesses has been talking to me every time I come in...but not necessarily in a special way, she talks to a lot of people of course. She jokes about me wearing the same brand of shoes every time(I have a small sneaker collection and for whatever reason she thinks it's funny I wear the exact same shoe but in a bunch of colors) and said she bought a pair because of me. She likes my car and always wants to talk about it(it's a 1974 AMC Gremlin, weird old car lol). She jokes to me about other regulars. Tells me snippets of what is going on in her life and asks about mine. Just silly interactions like that.

Anyway...this has been going on for several months and I really think I like her. In any other context(i.e. not a customer - service provider situation) I would have absolutely asked her out by now. She's my type(kind of chubby, kind of nerdy, leans towards cute vs ""hot""). I feel it's necessary to say because of the autistic comment, I definitely do date and do not have any major issues with girls.

The co-op is around 2 hours away and he's moving up there to be close to it. Then, he's leaving in January to study abroad halfway across the world. 

I just don't know what to do in this situation. We love each other and he's a wonderful guy. However, I don't know if doing long distance for a year is viable or reasonable. 

We won't be able to see each other while he studies abroad. He's said he'll drive down on most weekends during his co-op, but I'm not sure about that since he hates driving. I'm not able to drive up to visit him much at all due to extreme anxiety from getting in a car accident in the area he's moving to.

My concerns:
1. We just won't end up seeing each other. I can't really drive up and I get the feeling he doesn't want to drive down
2. I don't want to hold him back. If his friends want to go out on the weekend, I don't want him to turn them down because he feels obligated to come down and visit me
3. We won't talk much. I'm not a fan of calls and he's not a fan of texts. Usually when one of us is away, we call for like 10 minutes a week and send a few texts each day. That level of communication might not be able to sustain a relationship for as long as he'll be gone
4. We've had a bit of trouble lately in that we tend to disagree (not fight) frequently and we have few hobbies in common. I'm worried that we'll be able to overlook these issues too easily in a LDR and then he'll come back and our relationship will be problematic again
5. A lot could change in the year he's gone without us realizing. We've both already changed so much since we got together, and I'm worried we'll do LD and reunite only too find out that were no longer compatible

First, my high school sweetheart and I were together for five years, split apart when I moved away to go to college, where not long after I met my current husband, whom I married at 23yo and soon to divorce (due to me recently finding out he was unfaithful to me).

The idea is crossing my mind that when I am ready to start dating again, I’m worried about how my history will come across to new potential relationships. I don’t want to commit to anyone right away, enjoy single life but of course I still want to settle down eventually…

So advice time! Here’s my situation. I’ve been in only two relationships in my life, and the reason they both ended weren’t really my fault (and trust me I know how that sounds, it’s not to say I have no accountability, I hate saying it that way but I also need to practice self-love so there’s that). 

I’ve stayed in shape over the years, never had kids! Would be open to kids but not a life goal. I cut off ties with my abusive family a long time ago so now I just have a wonderful loving network of friends locally and all over the world. I have a steady job and support myself, I’ll be living on my own when this divorce settles. I’ve been doing great in therapy and really learned to love myself and enjoy who I am. I love to travel, road trips or flying internationally. And just as well enjoy staying home with my books and pets. I love weed but don’t drink, anymore. When I go out it’s usually for mocktails and dancing, even though I might not be good at it, it’s still fun! 

I haven’t dated since I was a teenager, well before dating apps existed!! Any advice for how to start? Which apps to use and for what? Hooking up? Real love connections? What should I say or not say?

2022-07-19 03:45:50,1,False,1,"Hello all. Last year I (NB, late 20s) took an Ancestry DNA test, ended up being an NPE and I learned I have two half sisters. It wasn't the biggest shock to me as my parents led kind of a hippie, 'free love' lifestyle back in the day and from about the age of 12, my mom had told me of possibility that one of these old flames might be my bio father. It never bothered me, but I also never gave it much thought because I'd ever in my life cross paths with this other man. 

We ended up moving back to my home state when I went to college, and for reasons unrelated to all of this eventually my parents divorced. After settling into single life, my mom was ready to look for companionship and began reminiscing about this old flame of hers. She didn't know if he was still in the state or even alive, so I offered to look him up on facebook and found he was in a nearby city. She reached out and they reconnected both as friends and romantically. It was kind of strange to come face to face with this man my mom said might be my bio dad, but at this point I still didn't know for sure, and truth be told wasn't particularly interested in going out of my way to find out. At this stage in life, I consider the man who raised me to be my dad regardless of biology and he is still in my life and we have the best relationship we've ever had. As for my mom's boyfriend... well, I view him as my mom's boyfriend and we get along just fine. 

I like genealogy and my partner got me an Ancestry DNA test as a gift. I was mostly interested in finding and connecting with cousins on my mom's side, but naturally the results revealed the truth of my paternity, which came as a surprise to none of us, but presented a new aspect to reckon with: he has 2 adult daughters (late 30s and early 40s), one of whom has kids, and so that meant I now have sisters, nieces and nephews.

I grew up as an only child to older parents. I didn't grow up with grandparents or cousins or aunts and uncles because they were pretty much all deceased before or shortly after I was born, so my experience of family was lonely and isolated -- just myself and my parents. As I kid I wanted siblings and a big extended family so badly. I did have a couple half-brothers on my (not-bio)dad's side, whom I met once when I was 15, and they treated me terribly. I was so excited to meet them, but they barely acknowledged me, said I was only around to watch their kids, and didn't see me as family or care to get to know me. I was crushed. 

So here I am again. When my mom's bf said he'd told my sisters about me and they wanted to meet me, I was so excited, but now the nerves are setting in. One of them seems to have some in common with me -- we share hobbies, interests, and values. The nieces and nephews are all under age 7, and given I never had younger siblings or cousins (and never worked with kids in a job) I have no idea how to interact with or relate to children that young. The other sister is harder to read -- she seems very religious and conservative, while I am queer and not a Christian... though I've been told that her ""tough girl act"" really is mostly an act. Still, I'm afraid -- what if they don't like me? What if it's a repeat of the time I met my so-called brothers? I'm not feminine or elegant or skilled in some craft or art like they are... what if I'm not what they'd hoped for? 

I know I'm not the first person nor will I be the last to discover and meet unknown siblings later in life, but it's not common enough for there to be any kind of established social etiquette, so I'm a bit at a loss for how to like... introduce myself, or how to build a familial relationship with people who have built entire lives before learning I exist (...if they even want one!) And truthfully I don't know how to be part of a family. I haven't really done it before. So I guess I'm just looking for some advice here on how to navigate these newfound sibling relationships.

I read an article on a teacher shortage and I was like, “shortage?… where’d they all go?”. The good answer is they found time to find a better job or better company after being mistreated during Covid. It’s really just the natural progression of things. The industry has had enough..


Anyway.. onto my topic. While reading some of these threads, I find people quit too quickly in a lot of scenarios. One was “my employer messed up my pay rate two pay periods in a row so I quit”. This was too soon. I’m not saying this is acceptable, but read on to get my idea. 

This is a great opportunity to learn how to talk to management and be stern with them. Just because your boss is your boss doesn’t mean you have to bend over each time. Tell them it’s unacceptable and you need to escalate this to someone asap. Be a bit of a Karen. Don’t start your normal duties until the problem is resolved. Not only do you get to swing your dick around a bit and learn some new stuff, but you are still getting paid. 

See my whole thing here, is that we should be taking more advantage of our employers before quitting. It’s their fault not yours. why should you go sit online and look for another job! What’s the worst that could happen, you get fired and end up exactly where you were gonna be anyway?

Of course this doesn’t work for many situations. If life sucks, quit. But quitting for small issues when you can “stick it to the man” a bit further is my point.

I’m a middle class engineer but I have had my fair share of crap jobs, retail and others, so I’ve been there.

There have been a few things that I have messed up on, mostly with scheduling, as I have never had a job where I make my own schedule. I have been working extra hard to be more organized.

She often refuses to talk to me about what happened until a couple days after, because she needs to cool down or figure out what to say to me, which generously fuels my anxiety. 

This most recent mess up that I had was during my receptionist shift. One of her clients walked in, so I said hello and that my boss is finishing up with her current client. She lady said no problem and that she was early. About 5-7 minutes after the client sat down and was waiting she looked at her phone and realized that her appointment was actually scheduled for the next day. I apologized to her and she left, no biggie. 

Well, my boss finished with her client and came into the lobby. She asked me what happened and I told her. She says to me “you know what, thank you, but you need to just go home.” I tried to apologize, but she would not listen. She just told me to pack up and leave.

I don’t know why I didn’t ask her name, I guess I just didn’t think it mattered all the much. We don’t have a “check in” system, and my boss was the only one working other than me, so I just assumed that of course it was her next client. 

That happened two days ago and I do not know what to say to my boss when I see her tomorrow.

Since I was a little kid, that's the one thing anyone has had to say about me. I was the funny kid, then the funny guy, and now a funny man. Everyone I know, the first word they use to describe me is 'funny'. It's my only valuable trait. I absolutely hate it, and its my fault for cultivating it.

In any interaction, my only social instinct is to make the other person laugh - and I do. After that, though, I can't do anything. Can't connect to other people on an emotional level, can't hold a conversation that doesn't sound like NPC dialogue - honestly, if it can't get a laugh, I often can't think of anything to say at all.

I don't feel like a person when I talk to people, I feel like a sort of tool. I have to provide this person whatever utility I can for as long as they need it - and my utility is to make people double over laughing - but outside of my ability to do that, I don't exist.

It's a difficult type of social ineptitude to describe, because humour is a great way to open any social interaction, so I can make a good impression. I can even make friends, provided the friendships are superficial enough to just be based on humour. After that, though, I'm just worthless.

This is where it is my fault. Bfm called me a few days after mentioning wanting to drop off some clothes for the baby. At first I said I was too tired and would like to rest some more but she insisted it would be a quick drop off visit. I reluctantly agreed. I have a hard time saying no to people.

The day comes when bfm arrives with 2 of her kids and her husband. I take baby outside to meet them and grab the few gifts they brought us, believing that they would be on their way. Turns out bf called for his dad to come to fix his car door. This would take a while. I expected the rest to go find a distraction but of course they cane for the baby. Not wanting to be rude, I invited them inside for some water and a chance to use the restroom. (This was my second mistake.) This ""quick drop off"" turned into an entire evening. There I was sleep deprived at 6pm with a baby in a full diaper I couldn't change because bfm wouldn't hand her back. Then my mom came out of her room for the first time the entire visit and she's yelling. Yelling about the mess and the running water in the bathroom and the clutter. I apologized to my mom and said I would get to it soon, taking blame for everything to save my bf's family. 
They thankfully got the hint and left soon after but not before catching an angry look from my mom watering outside. Later that night I got a call from bfm mentioning my mom's demeanour and saying that she will never step foot in that house again. I apologized for my mom and admitted to have fault for not turning down the visit that I admittedly didn't want either. Mentioning the agreement of less visits I had with my mom prior. I guess this isn't what she wanted to hear. 

After that, m mom had a sit down with me and bf. She said she does not want any more visits because she is not comfortable with people walking into her house and looking through her things and destroying her home.(Referring to one kid scratching up the dining table.) I agreed to what she said because to me it made perfect sense; her house her rules. 
My bf was a different story. He went off about how dare she say that his mom can't see his baby. He also immediately went outside and called his mom to tell her what had been said. I was called AGAIN by bfm told that ""if I loved her son, I would gather savings to move out."" I. Was. Lost. Moving was not an option in my mind. My mom isn't the greatest but after living squished in a studio apartment, I knew me and my baby were most comfortable in a house. 

Of course, I was mad and brought it up to my bf who threatened to ""do whatever it takes to keep his daughter."" 
Throughout my pregnancy and labor, I felt at peace because I knew that me and my baby would be okay no matter what happens. There, in that moment, that peace was gone. 

Me and my bf calmed down and smoothed things out afterwards. He said that he said those things in the moment and that it was brought up by bfm. Including ""advice"" to leave me. 
Ever since I have not had a day where I think about this woman. Sometimes I take out that anger on bf, remembering all those times he put bfm before me and our baby. I would like to continue gathering with bf's family for the sake of my baby.( I didn't have great experiences with my extended family as a kid.) However, I don't think there is any possibility of ""repairing"" a relationship with his mom.

2022-10-30 20:34:05,26,False,8,"I (F,31) have been married to my husband (M,30) for almost 10 years and we have 1 kid (F,7). 

For a little bit of backstory- I don't like cooking and have always struggled with disordered eating. Before my daughter was born, my husband and I mostly lived off of convenience food and take out- when she started eating solids was when I started making an effort to cook, which I did for years.

Early on during the pandemic I was really struggling to feed myself,  I would come home from work and make dinner but by the time it was done I would be so exhausted that even trying to eat what I just made made me feel nauseated, so I wouldn't eat for days at a time. I lost a lot of weight because I unintentionally starved myself for abut 2-3 months before I actually registered that there might be a problem.

About 6 months ago I decided that I didn't want to be responsible for cooking dinner for the family anymore. I realized that the whole process, from planning out the menu to prepping and cooking is very stressful and overwhelming for me. My husband also has a somewhat strict diet due to his athletic hobbies- he's often either bulking or cutting weight, so always having to keep track of his current diet was just another source of stress and anxiety for me.

I still make my daughter lunch every day for school, make him breakfast every night and do most of the grocery shopping. The only part I asked him to participate in was the menu and the cooking- I even do the dishes. Also, even if I don't ""cook"", I do make sure my daughter eats and I remind myself to eat (most days)- even if it's hot dogs or chicken nuggets.

Cue last week, when he came home late from a training session and looked in the fridge to find that I had not made any dinner, despite the fridge being full of ingredients. He got mad  and said he couldn't believe I can't take the time to cook a single chicken breast so he has something to eat when he gets home. That's when I reminded him that I had made it very clear that dinners were not going to be my responsibility and why. He called me an asshole and said that I was being inconsiderate of his health, that he needs to be able to eat nutritionally good food and not just take out that he gets while he's out. 

I suppose I did see the packet of chicken sitting there and maybe it wouldn't have taken too much for me to pop it in the airfryer with some BBQ sauce or something, but I feel like he's manipulating me and trying to force me into cooking again by default.

I don't feel particularly bad about not cooking because I told him months ago that I don't want to be responsible for dinner, and that he would be better suited for it since he likes cooking more than I do and is more willing to try new things than I ever was.

Yesterday our high school had a boba fundraiser. On avg, they have one every month- or twice when we're lucky. I looked at the flavors and happened to have $5 on me, which I used to buy a mango lychee tea drink. However, this flavor was very popular and I ended up getting one of the last ones.

Mia notices me walk into my extra period (Debate) and asks me if she can have some of my boba. By ""have,"" she means sharing the straw, which I have told her multiple times I don't like to do (esp. because I just got sick). I politely decline, and she gives me these puppy dog eyes. Multiple times I make eye contact with her looking at my drink.

Luckily, a classmate bails me out and tells Mia that she can use her $5. Mia is the type of person to ask everyone around her for money but never really bring any money to these boba fundraisers. I have bought her boba before (just as an FYI). However, by the time Mia makes it downstairs, they have already run out of the flavor she wants. She then comes upstairs and asks again if I can share her boba with her. I decline again.

Now here's where I might be TA:

I go outside to practice my debate as it is a quiet place. By the time I come back, I'm very cold and don't feel like drinking the tea anymore. I have about 1/3 of the drink left, counting ice cubes. I notice that Lucy feels a little down and was looking at my drink. I've never bought her anything before and she doesn't really like asking people for food because Mia usually overshadows her. I ask her if she wants the rest. Her face immediately brightens up and accepts happily.

Upon seeing this, Mia immediately expresses her discontent and basically tells me off in the middle of the classroom, leaving me stunned. She then didn't talk to me for the next day, leaving a sort of weird tension in the debate room. 

I asked some mutuals of what they thought about the situation. Some said I was TA because I didn't share my drink when Mia asked first. Others thought that ""I had a right to my own drink.""

2022-12-13 03:03:00,9,False,1,"My wife (32F) and I (35M) have been married going on 7 years, together for almost 10 years. For reasons that I’ll try to explain briefly, I’ve been unhappy in our relationship for years and probably should’ve broken it off a long time ago at several different points, but here I find myself.

For some context of our current state, we have two toddler-aged kids together. Since the kids were born during COVID, childcare options were extremely limited for us. We decided that we’d have her leave her job to care for the kids. So in a nutshell, I work full time, mostly from home lately, and she’s a stay at home mom for the kids. I have a pretty successful career and work about 40 hours a week. After work, we split the household duties.

My main issue is that there’s been zero intimacy in our relationship since my wife’s pregnancy. Basically no physical contact whatsoever for 3 years now, unless there’s extreme extenuating circumstances like I had a bad day and pleaded for a hug. There’s no sitting in bed watching a movie together, no hugs, and absolutely nothing sexual at all. Barely any conversations either. I’m an introvert, and it’s still too little for me.

Her reasoning is that she’s too tired from watching the kids all day to do anything. Doesn’t want to be touched because they’re touching her all day. Things like that. Last week she told me to get a girlfriend or see an escort. She isn’t serious, but she really said that. And no, I won’t.

For years, our intimacy had been on a steady decline, but it’s been the utter lack of anything these last 3 years that’s been the most problematic for me. And there’s no end in sight. It wasn’t always this way. For our first years together, things were perfect, in my opinion.

The most hurtful thing is that she doesn’t seem to care, despite my efforts to talk to her. I’ve tried to explain my feelings, but she’ll usually turn it into an argument about how bad things are for her. Or about how I don’t work as hard as she does. I feel like she belittles my contributions to our family, which hurts because they’re my entire world and reason for living. I can’t put it into words just how much I love my kids. They’re the best. I love them more than I hate my marriage.

So I sit here at a crossroads. Do I just tolerate this reality so that I can be here everyday for my kids? I can’t bear to be without them. Or do I pursue a divorce, meanwhile losing a substantial portion of my income to spousal and child support, while also not being able to be in my kids’ life as much? Is there another way?

To answer some questions before you ask them:
- I’m pretty sure that I’m not a total asshole. 
- I try to meet her needs, but I must be failing at that.
- We did a short stint (maybe 6-8 weeks) of couples counseling about 5-6 years ago (well before kids). There’s a lot of detail that I could go into regarding this, but I’m trying to keep this relatively short. One of the most disappointing things for me about counseling was that there were days when she couldn’t bring herself to attend. (In my words), she felt like she was getting attacked and didn’t like to hear that she had things to learn and improve upon. I ended up doing several of the sessions solo, and then we eventually stopped going altogether.
- I regret not getting a divorce after the counseling failure.
- As far as I know, there’s been no infidelity for either of us.
- Try as I may, I’m not in love with this woman anymore. I think she feels the same. We just tolerate each other, like roommates.
- I’m not perfect

TL;DR After several escalations of commitment in my relationship (marriage, house, kids, etc), it seems that my only options are staying in a miserable, intimacy-devoid marriage so that I can be with my kids everyday, or getting a divorce but being miserable without money or my kids.

Fast forward 3 years later, we got together and became online couple for 4 long years. We decided to break up because of long distance as he is in another country while I’m in another (However we are both neighbouring country so not that bad I guess) we did not talk for 5 long years. However we were social media friends so we both knows what going on in our life. 

One day he decided to text me on social media as I posted a new game I’m playing. From there we started talking again and play games together too. I starting to fall in for him again and apparently he as well. We’ve been doing this for 7 whole months. I indirectly confess to him but he said he’s not ready. 

The reason would be we both have different education background. He has a degree and I have a Master. He thinks he is not good enough for me. I try to convince him otherwise cause I fall for him for who he is and not his education background. He keep changing the subject when we talk about this so I just brush it off. 

Things got complicated after that. He starts texting messages and deletes them every time . I caught him texting ‘love you but I can’t’ then deleted it before I can reply. I ask him what he texted and he said it’s nothing. Then I confront him and said I saw his message and he said I must have seen it wrong . I ask why he keep deleting messages but he just never answer my question. 

At this rate, I feels like giving up already cause this has been on for months. Also I have to think about long distance thing. I can visit him too but he is reluctant to visit me . I’ve never meet him in person and he refuse to video call. Only ever saw his photo once but he saw many of my photos in social media. Physical attraction is also important for me , if we were to do this I’m afraid it’s not enough unless either one of us decided to move in together.

My SO and I (24F) have been together for a bit over a year and a half and have lived together for about 8 months. Overall, we have a very loving and happy relationship and I feel very supported and cared for, and that we are very physically and emotionally compatible, which is why this issue has perplexed me a bit. 

As all couples do when they first start dating, we had tons of early relationship sex. Once that dissipated, I noticed some trends that typically when I initiated, it was met with “later” or being brushed off in some capacity. At first, I knew it was because he was exhausted from his job (it’s physically demanding and it was a very busy time) and I know things like this ebb and flow. However, this issue has returned on and off since then and it’s left me feeling embarrassed and rejected. 

There have been moments I’ve tried to kiss him and he seems annoyed, which really hurt my feelings. Or I try to get touchy and he just doesn’t want that. However, he’s very touchy with me and I never say no to sex. It feels like he holds all the power on when we have sex. It’s not that we don’t have enough sex, (1-3x a week) but it’s that when we do, he decided when and he makes the move. When I do the same things, I it feels like I’m almost always rejected. I mentioned my feelings of embarrassment and a lot of what I’ve said here, and his response was defensiveness and to say “well should it only be on YOUR terms then?” Which really hurt. Occasionally, we’ve had quickies that are only for his satisfaction, but other that that our sex is wonderful and so passionate and I always left feeling satisfied, and so does he. 

I felt really dismissed and really shitty. It makes me wonder if there’s something bigger I’m missing. The most confusing part is that our sex is wonderful!

2022-02-26 16:04:54,5,False,2,"I’m in my mid 20s and going to a mediocre university, studying humanities. For the past 6 months or so I’ve been feeling super depressed. It feels like everyone who I used to know is doing so much better in life than I am now. Every time I talk to a childhood friend and they update me on the lives of people we used to know, they’re either doing a masters at some Ivy League schools or just landed a fantastic job in finance or moved to NYC to work for the UN…

Also I know it sounds stupid but I just feel like everyone around me is finding love or losing weight or doing both. As for me I was preparing to do an exchange in Europe last year and I was so so excited but unfortunately it got cancelled last minute due to omicron and I guess I never properly processed that I just compartmentalized my disappointment so I can keep on going with my studies. 

But recently I find myself being hit with a whim of just deep depression and feeling of inadequacy, in the middle of a task, in class, or when I’m writing papers etc. I’m graduating in a year and I’m trying my best to keep going and meet deadlines and just get my degree because that’s the right path. But I often mind myself loathing my decision of going into humanities (I love what I study, it’s just hard to find a job and my field is paid not nearly close to what a finance bro or programmer would make). I regret not going into science or medicine or finance like most of my friends. I don’t know if I would make a different decision if I could choose again, I feel too old to start over with everything also I don’t find any of these high paying fields interesting.

I grew up with plenty of opportunities, my parents supported me through and through. However I just feel like such a fraud and I have made a mess out of my life despite all the advantages I had in life. People I grew up with are doing so much better in life. I feel like my dreams are being crushed and the weight of being an adult is almost too heavy to bear.

I guess I don’t know what’s the point of this post. I just want to vent but I cannot do that in real life cuz my problems are so “first world problems” comparing to what’s going on in the rest of the world. However I do struggle with these feelings, these sadness, these voids. Sometimes I stay up all night just feeling like a total failure. I try and I try and I try and I just feel like I’ve made all the wrong decisions. Or maybe I’m just not meant for excellence.

My dream since childhood had been to work for the UN one day. I’m no where near that. The other day I got news that a girl who dated my ex  is now working at the UN. I didn’t react much to it on the surface just went on about my life and told myself there’s no point in comparing myself to others. But it actually crushed me. I know all the “life is a marathon not a sprint” talk and I shouldn’t compare my path to others, but I can’t help it.

2022-03-06 21:40:21,5,False,0,"Throwaway account due to the details... And a heads up, this is a long post.

I've (M40) been married to my avoidant partner (F41) for about 15 years and we have 3 kids together. For the first 10 years, I thought she was just emotionally closed off but that I would eventually crack the problem, have a breakthrough and make things good. That breakthrough never happened and a somewhat toxic cycle would occur (one that I now know is common for Avoidants), the push/pull cycle.

Up until recently, I didn't know about attachment theory, nor what an Avoidant was. Apparently, Avoidants are hard wired to push away when things get too close (emotionally). They don't even know they're doing it. They'll start being negative, and if you try to fix it, or ask to talk about it to find out what you can do to make it better, it further triggers their Avoidant tendencies and they'll push harder and meaner (eg, you're being too sensitive, I don't want to talk about it, start being more negative   
 / critical, etc...). 

That ""push"" away causes the partner to distance themselves (eg, silent treatment, or spending more time with friends). Once the close intimacy has been reduced, the Avoidant is happy again and will start being nice.

So, after the 10 year mark or so, I \*finally\* noticed that the more distant I was, the nicer she'd be. The problem was, I couldn't maintain that distance and not being ""nice"" for very long. So, I'd eventually fall back into trying to talk to her more and being nice more, which would trigger the pushing me away again. It was a bad cycle that finally broke me not too long ago.

As with most long term marriages, ""just leave"" isn't an easy option. There are other factors that make it frustrating:

* We have 3 kids
* During our marriage, we built up a fairly large net worth of over $10 million. This was due to the efforts and opportunities I created (she even says she doesn't feel like it's her money, even though I tell her time and time again that it's our money and she can buy whatever she wants). In any event, it's a lot of money to split and to be left with half of. While I know most people would love to have a $5 million net worth, it sucks to lose so much.
* She's a good wife in almost all other ways, such as we have sex frequently, she's responsible, faithful and even thrifty
* The main problem is, we simply co-exist on an emotional level. She's not fun, adventurous, nor is she someone I can confide with and have deep conversations. In a tough or stressful situation, I wouldn't be able to look to her as a ""team"" mate and know that she'd have my back. Instead, it'd be up to me to solve it on my own. Once it was solved, she'd probably be negative of the whatever way I solved it.
* I receive almost no compliments. During the 10 years or so it took to build something that sold for millions, I finally received my first real compliment once the funds hit the bank account. That compliment was ""I'm proud of you"". That was the only compliment I received during the 10 year time related to what had been built.

Imagine if you could never be emotionally close to your spouse - and if you tried, they'd get mad at you and push you away. But as long as you stayed ""friendly"" with them, but not emotionally close, things would be good.

She refuses therapy, and when I forced her to go a couple of times (by saying I was leaving if we didn't do it), she went but lashed out and refused to talk during the session and was mean the entire day leading up to it.

So, it's clear that I can maintain a stable, co-existence with her that isn't bad per-se (such as, we basically don't argue, no infidelity, no wild spending, no domestic violence or anything, no yelling), but at the same time, more of a live in FWB type situation.

I love to make people happy and I want to be happy and be with someone who listens and has a close emotional connection and actually supports me. At the same time, I know the grass is always greener and am worried about leaving a stable relationship for my selfish reasons of wanting to actually emotionally connect and have a mutually beneficial relationship.

2022-03-10 23:08:58,1,False,2,"Hi, I'm struggling a lot right now and I feel like I'm going crazy. I broke up with my gf 3 weeks ago, we were 2 months in relationship (in secret; she wanted too keep it secret) she was my university friend, we have same friend group  and I have to be with here 8 hours a day because we have lab together and are in same group, and doing Master Thesis together. We broke up by her saying that we need a break, so if time passes and we still wanted each other after that then its right thing. 

She told me that I mean a lot to her, and that she wants us to slow down (to hang out as friends) because it was all too fast. We work together on a master thesis, and she really helps me a lot because I am slow learner and have low self esteem, and feel inferior all the time, and she is really smart.And just feel like I can't do it on my own without her. I think she wants a man and I am not Alpha male. The problem is that I see her every day and I still want something with her and I am hoping she will want me back. But the relationship is weird now (at least I think, or it’s just my anxiety). It just don't feel right, our conversations aren't so deep like they used to be. But she still texts me first and when I text her back her answers are shorter and it takes her longer to reply. Last week I was sick and she even called me, and texted me. 

Its strange ( but I think it's important for story) couse she stayed friends with her ex, hes even her best friend they are chatting every day. When we were in relationship she told me that nothing will ever happen between tham again. That she told him that they are JUST FRIENDS and FOR NOW she can guarantee (99 %) that will not change! But don't know what will happen in future.

Every day I hope she tells me she still wants me back. But I think, more and more, that she doesn't want me that way anymore, that she doesn't look at me the same way she used to, I am not even shure that she wants this friendship anymore. And that she regrets sleeping with me ( I am her second, her first time was in highschool).But I just can't accept any of that in my hearth. It makes me so anxious that we are together all day but i dont feel that vibe that we used to have during relationship and even before relationship. I am seeking her approval and her validation so badly. And I feel so stressed out and anxious all the time when shes around.

In January she asked me again and I'd had enough and refused she didn't speak to me for almost 7 days when I reached out as I missed her and wanted to talk to her and see her. We spoke and thought things were fine then she has an issue with money again but didn't tell me or ask me so when I spoke to her she was angry with me and I wasn't sure what I had done so after a few days as much as I love her I couldn't keep going like it so I made the choice and broke up. A few days went by and she contacted me and said we wanted to be Matess still and keep in contact for our nieces and nephews plus our pets so it was like we were still together but not if you know what I mean then when I was having a bad day she came over and told me that she was ready to move on it shattered me I was hoping we could work it out.

2022-04-29 18:26:18,1,False,1,"Hi there guys, I wanted to share a situation to see what people think about this and can maybe offer some suggestion. 

My best friend, call him Aaron, and me are friends with two other people in a friend group, Mike and Sarah. Over time, Mike and Sarah start getting into a relationship. Everything seems to go well, up until a certain point. It got rocky, with lots of fighting so the relationship ended after almost a year,  and are not friends anymore. Just days after, Aaron decides to meet up with Sarah. They end up drinking and well, decided to have sexual relations. Weeks or so after this, Sarah and Mike decide to start being friends again. Mike found out that Sarah and Aaron have hooked up just after the relationship ended, from Sarah herself. Once Mike found out about this, he immediately stopped talking to Aaron. So, with Aaron realizing this, he tried to explain to Sarah (and to Mike through Sarah) that it was an accident and that they were drinking so things got out of hand. But, despite this, and after a week or so, Mike and Sarah decided to cut communication with Aaron altogether.  (Note, while all this was happening, Aaron was trying to help Sarah with her relationship problems about Mike to help her go through this. Now, I don't know what Aaron was telling Sarah, in the sense that he could have manipulated her into thinking Mike was crazy. Same goes with Mike maybe telling Sarah that Aaron is manipulating her).

Fast forward to a couple of more weeks, Mike and Sarah got into another big fight and are no longer friends. Sarah apologizes to Aaron about this whole situation and how Aaron was in the right about Mike and are now on talking terms. Then, after about a couple of months, with all this drama hopefully washing over, I decided to contact Mike to see if he wants to be friends again with everyone. He was interested in being friends and forgetting about all this. 

So, perfect. Everyone is one big family again with no drama: Mike, Aaron, Sarah and me. 
HOWEVER, this last part of what I'm going to say is where it rubs me the wrong way completely and is where I would want opinions from others. I may have missed out details, but I tried to get the overarching part of the whole drama.

After months have passed with no drama or anything, Aaron and Sarah decided to have friends with benefits after all this time. Keep in mind, Aaron swore to never have any sort of sexual relations with Sarah after all of this went down. Also, note that when Sarah cut communications with Aaron, he was talking badly about her, about how she was absolutely crazy (same with Mike too).

The only reason I found out about Aaron and Sarah having this friends with benefits is because he told me when he was drunk, and most likely he does not remember tell me this. And if he did remember, he is pretending that he didn't say it, or is praying that I don't remember. 

And so, the reason I am putting this post on reddit is because I wanted to confront Aaron about this, about how it is completely hypocritical and selfish to have this relationship with Sarah. What do you guys think I should do? Aaron is a friend I've known for a decade. Should I just let it go?

2022-04-29 18:26:28,11,False,5,"I'm 52, my wife is 57, we met in 2003, married in 2007. She has two children from a previous marriage, now in their 20s, whom I helped raise from pre-K age. Our daughter lives with her father while attending college. Our son has high-functioning autism and lived with us from 2015 until very recently.

We live in a cabin in the woods, on a remote mountaintop - a lifelong dream of hers. Our son was stagnating here and was quite unhappy. We decided that he would be better served living in the city with his father, where he would have better resources and opportunities. Everyone was onboard with the decision, including our son. My wife drove him to his father's on February 2 and planned on staying for a couple of weeks (this was not unusual).

Communication was initially sparse, and even then was only short, immediate answers. She ghosted me completely on March 11. No responses at all, via any medium.

So I guess I'm not married anymore.

I finally got a text message from her on April 2 telling me that she hasn't made a payment on our land for over a year, and we are $3000 behind. I have no way of coming up with that kind of money. The property will be locked up and I will be locked out in the coming days or weeks.

So I'm also essentially homeless.

I'm too old and too tired to rebuild my life from scratch again. I did it when I moved to California to be with my wife, and I did it again when we moved here. I cannot imagine going back to civilization and getting a job, especially when I am literally flat broke and have no place to live (I only know mountain folk, nobody in the nearest city) and have absolutely no desire to do so. I cannot find the will.

I don't have a driver's license so simply leaving the mountain isn't really an option. I don't have anywhere to go and can't afford any gasoline to get there if I did.

My entire life has fallen to ruins in just a few months. Complete and utter devastation. I'm an absolute mess. I'm constantly nauseated, cannot eat, and can't sleep because every sound I hear could be authorities showing up to drag me off my land.

I'm not scared of death, but I am terrified of having to kill myself. Even so, I can clearly see that I really don't have any other options - particularly when I can't even find the will to work *toward* anything. I'm resigned. I'm beaten.

They were in a box in the breakroom and we were expected to help ourselves if we wanted one. Here are the three interactions that I (28/F) had with my coworker “Sarah”(35/F) on Friday.

11:00am:  
Sarah comes into my office to tell me there’s cupcakes in the breakroom, and asks if I want to go with her to get one. I say not right now, but I might get one later. Sarah says to suit myself and goes into the breakroom. She comes in again on her way back, eating her cupcake, and tells me that they’re really good. I agree they look good. Sarah leaves.

12:30pm:   
Sarah stops by my office again on her way back from the breakroom with a second cupcake. She says that she’s on her second one and asks me if I’m sure I don’t want one. I say not yet and tell her to enjoy hers. Sarah says thank you and leaves.

1:00pm:  
“Katie” (31/F) comes into my office and asks me if I’ve had a cupcake already. I say no. She says she’s about to get one and that there are only a couple left, so I should get one now if I want one. I say okay and go with Katie to the breakroom. We each get a cupcake and start eating them while chatting in the breakroom. Sarah comes into the breakroom during this time. She sees me and says it looks like the cupcakes finally got to me. I say that I decided to get one before they all got eaten. Sarah gets a beverage out of the fridge and leaves.

Today, two different coworkers have come up to me to ask me what happened between Sarah and me on Friday. One of them explained that Sarah told all the workers in her section of the office that I made a fatphobic remark about her eating too many cupcakes. I didn’t mean anything of the kind, so as soon as I heard this I went to Sarah to apologize for the misunderstanding.

When I spoke to Sarah, she said she couldn’t accept my apology because I obviously wasn’t being honest with her. She says it would be one thing if I had just accidentally fatshamed her with my words, but that I also refused to be seen eating with her when I was fine eating with Katie. (Katie and I are both thinner than Sarah.) I explained again that I didn’t mean to hurt Sarah’s feelings at all and said I was sorry if she took it that way.

I (28F) found by accident in my husband’s (32M) phone this “porn app” (let’s call it that) where he could receive tons of material from strangers around the globe. In this app I also found a folder of saved material. A wide variety of naked women. 

I confronted him and asked what was all that? I actually thought this app (as it is part of their features) was being used by my husband to chat to other women, sexting and probably more. 

He told me I was misunderstanding the whole thing. I let him explained himself. He said he’s into amateur porn and this was a way for him to get it. That he has never chat with anyone and would never cheat on me. Just being part of a massive group of unsolicited porn images. 

So my problem with this is the following: 

Let’s assume he’s telling the truth... 

I would say everyone has watched and enjoyed porn regardless of being single, in a relationship or married. For me, watching porn is a normal adult interest, even more when it comes to men. 

BUT, why do you need to have a particular folder to save your favorite ones? If I compare it any other image or meme you could find on the internet, you only save those that are priceless in some way, for you to cherish. 
As I see it, my husband founds a “value” in these women’s pictures.
If he’s into amateur, he could’ve asked for my pictures, to record ourselves, or just watch porn and let it go. Instead he prefers saving other women’s bodies in his phone, taking them with him at all time. 

This gives me the message that I’m not enough (sexually) for him. It messes with my sexual self-esteem. And for now I don’t feel like having any intimacy with him. I feel offended. 

Let me know your opinions. If you would consider I am overreacting. I don’t feel comfortable knowing that my partner has an app and he could initiate a sex chat at anytime.

Around our 4th month of dating I got pregnant and after about a month of sitting on the situation we decided to get an abortion because we felt that we weren’t ready to be parents yet. We both said we had never felt closer than the 6 weeks we knew I was pregnant. How much closer to your partner can you be than when you’ve created a life together?

Anyways, fast forward to after We move in together in January. 

I manifested this man. I manifested every detail from his height to his age to his car and to what season we’d meet. Almost everything came true. He is so affectionate which I love because it’s very hard for me to show affection. It’s hard for me to call him babe or baby but I love when he calls me that. He’s always telling me how much he loves me and calls me cute or beautiful at least twice a day. He never expects me to pay for anything (I do anyways when I can) and he pays most of the bills except for my personal car and phone bills. I would like to throw in that when I was in high school, I was diagnosed with bipolar and depression and was on medication for it for a short while before my dad took them away because he didn’t want me to become dependent on them like my grandma is. I don’t blame him for that. I think I’ve been fine without them and to be honest I feel like every teenager claims to be depressed or have bipolar so I never tell anyone. The only thing about it though is that I feel like I have an internal switch that shuts off sometimes and it makes me cold-hearted. I look at him and feel disgusted. I don’t want to be near him. I get feelings of wanting to hurt him emotionally. I threaten to break up with him claiming to feel like we don’t belong together. One time I told him that I wish I never left my parents house and that even though I hated living there, I would rather be there than w him. In the moment, it’s how I actually feel and after I say these things it’s like a weight is lifted off my shoulders and I don’t feel that way anymore but the damage is done. Then I cry and get mad when he doesn’t want to just forget about what just came out of my mouth and cuddle with me. 

I also wasn’t really the jealous type until after he moved out of his parents house (one month before I did) and we would spend every day all day together. Now I get upset when he wants to hang out with his friends even though it’s not often. I think it could be because I don’t really have friends to hang out with. I do have my sister who is 21 and we’ve always been very close and my coworker turned friend and I would consider them my best friends but I feel like I’d just rather spend my time w my bf and get upset when he wants to do his own thing.

So a bit of background. Im 24, the coworker is 24 also. We get along *really* well, in my own opinion. They've made jokes about seeing me as a sibling type relationship in front of other people at the office. Should mention I'm a guy, they are a girl. Been working there almost 4 months now, and we have decent conversations most days in the midst of work. We both work desk jobs in an office. We have each other's numbers too, and text about work stuff every now and again, but lately I've tried to joke around a bit in hopes of sparking a conversation outside the office. They are pretty unresponsive there, and sometimes don't reply at all after like one text. I feel like that's a signal, so I dont wanna push, but genuinely feel like we get along so well at the office. 

Should also mention I don't have an interest romantically, at least at the moment, and am pretty sure I'm not giving off those vibes. My question/plea for advice...how do you chat well with a coworker about non work related things? I'm a bit socially awkward cause of how I grew up too. And its been a long time since I've felt such a genuine connection with someone in real life. 

Would really appreciate any advice people have, even if thats just saying 3 months is too soon. Mostly just trying to stop overthinking about it cause I do that all the time.

2022-09-23 14:00:39,3,False,2,"I (27F) have been friends with this guy (27M) and girl (30F). We used to hangout a lot together, Me and my BF, him and her, and couple of friends, but the core was always the 4 of us.

Last year, shortly after we first met and hang out together, the guy made a move on her. They made out a little bit while we're on a club. Eventually, it didn't work out (the guy hasn't moved on from his long-time crush apparently) but the guy didn't say anything to her that signaled that they're ending. He just ended any romantic gesture abruptly. But from there, we still are hanging out together. I heard from one of the girl's bff that she thinks they're just a drinking buddy and is satisfied with that (she's not that into him). Things went great for a couple of months. I was out of the country for a month for a holiday. When I came back, everything fall apart. Apparently, the girl bailed on concerts and get-togethers without letting any of us know. She just sold her own tickets and disappear. And never hang out with us ever since.

Eventually I figured out that she indeed has a problem with the guy. Our mutual friend said that there're a lot of trivial things about him that she didn't enjoy (his IG personality, he bailed on our friend's bday party because he's too drunk, etc.) and has been gatekeeping me and my bf to hangout with her and our mutual friends because she doesn't want us to invite him. The thing is all of this she didn't say anything at all to me. Met her a couple of days ago for a coffee date and she said that she's been making some changes in her life to be happier and get rid of people she didn't enjoy hanging with. I respect that for her and actually I'm happy that she's working on her life. The guy know this fact and think it's trivial (except for the fact that they had a history). He's pretty cool with the whole situation, although he still wanna make amends with her.

There's a recent event where my bf invited the guy to this big party that was held by our mutual friends, so clearly, the girl is here. Apparently, she's pretty upset that my bf invited the guy, although it's not her event per se.

I'm just so tired to be diplomatic and honestly don't know what to do. I cherished them both as a friend and don't want to pick a side. I hated to not be invited to things because I might invite this guy. But I also hated that the guy didn't invited to things just bcs everyone else is considerate of her. My bf told me that I should not be neutral and pick a side. My bf is clearly on the guy's side. Should I take a side? 

My other thinking is that I'll keep inviting both of them, and whoever is uncomfortable showing up will naturally fall off. I'm not good at losing friends, more so a friend with who I shared may mutual friends, and I hate to pick sides.

Sorry for the essay and lots of character but there's just too many nuances in this whole thing, I think.

PS: My 1 on 1 relationship with both of them: guy - very much close with him, he's great to talk to and pretty much an open book, we know each other's secret and keep updated on recent personal life news. With the girl - we shared many mutual friends and hang out as a group a lot, but we're not that close in terms of talking about secrets and stuff. Regardless, I still consider both of them to be my good friend.",relationship_advice,Caught between two friends....,2.5,2022-09-23
2022-09-23 14:00:40,0,False,21,"I was teaching full-time for the last 6 years - 1 year in England and 5 years in Canada. I spent the last decade of my life dedicated to this career, including getting 2 degrees at once in university. 

The pay and benefits in Canada are not horrible if you can land a full-time permanent position (some teachers are stuck supply teaching for many years). The issue was that the working conditions compared to 10 years ago are much worse with greater expectations and workloads placed on teachers. We also have our provincial leader and Education Minister hellbent on destroying healthcare and education. We had a strike and picketed outside right before lockdowns in -25 degree Celsius weather. 

When lockdowns started, I started my own art business as a way to escape teaching online with no resources (literally, no laptops no nothing and we had to buy our own things and spend hours making our own online lessons). I didn’t create art for 7+ years due to focusing on teaching and stressors like this. 

Then I got shingles… in my 20s. I went to the ER at 5am and got diagnosed after extreme pain for a week. After picking up medication, I logged in and taught for the week because it would’ve been more work to leave detailed lesson plans for my online class. 

I taught online for another year and took the scary leap of resigning in June of this year to focus on my art. 

I was really scared and the sunken cost fallacy isn’t fun. I am fortunate enough to have saved some money just in case while I run my business and study to try shifting to a career in a creative field or education outside of public education structures. I networked and got a job offer to managing Marketing for an experiential education company but I had pre-scheduled things during their peak times; however it IS possible to seek other alternatives in education.

As of writing this, I am currently a senior in high school, and the girl that was rude to me is a sophomore. 
Anyways. Just yesterday during my first period study hall, I was just quietly busy typing on my school laptop while minding my own business, and as I’m typing and doing my work, I can hear a small group of girls behind me laughing. Hearing their laughter, I quietly turn my head to look and just acknowledge that they exist. I look at them for at least a few short seconds, and see as one of them makes eye contact with me, so I simply just give the girl a simple upwards head nod to say “What’s up?” I then quietly turned back to my work and hear as the girls laughter goes silent as the girl I said hi to just begun to laugh to the point of actual tears (like, I’m not joking, she was seriously crying). So, I quietly look back at her and just give a look of confusion, and can hear one of her own friends ask if she was ok, but also hear as she tells her friend “He is so weird”. Making eye contact with me again, she asks me to look away, and it takes me a few seconds to process what she said since I was still lost by how much she laughed and cried, and even more loss by her sudden demand to have me look away. She asks me again, and before I even could, she proceeds to ask me in a pissed tone why I was in the first place. And simply I tell her in a calm but also stern tone, that the reason why I am looking at her to begin with is that i can hear her laughing like a hyena on drugs, and hear her call me weird after I simply said hello to her. I proceeded to look away, hearing her say something else but not caring to remember or listen since I was done with her. 

Just maybe a minute or two later after that, I proceed to ask some of my discord friends if I was being weird for just saying hi to her. And of course, I get a few responses saying that I’m not just cause, what’s weird about saying hi to someone? But as I put my story to tell on a discord server that I have been on for at least 4 years now. Just maybe about an hour later, one of my friends proceeds to tell me that a girl would call me weird because of how I was looking at her. And starts saying that I act like people you hear about who are neckbeards, and tells me I am indeed weird for looking at her. I argue with him for a while, telling him that I told her what I said because I wasn’t gonna just sit there and take her behind the back comment and wanted to call him out on how he defended her like a neckbeard, but I honestly just didn’t want to continue on with this stupid banter anymore.",AmItheAsshole,"AITAH for saying hello to a girl, calling her out for laughing at me as she calls me weird for simply saying hi to her?",6.0,2022-09-23

2022-09-30 23:55:19,1,False,1,"Yesterday I posted a post detailing my grief over losing my new born bunny.

I was in pain. I was in deep mourning and I still am, and my parents, to rub salt into my wound, came to my house while I was at work, and took two of my male bunnies and gave them away, leaving me with only the female. 

I came home, and I broke down. Two more losses after two, a day after the other. 

They will not tell me where and who they gave them to.

I was once again aggressively told to shut up over my crying over the phone with them.

I cried and wailed alone in my bedroom for two straight hours, not even bothering to take off my work clothes. Mourning both losses at the same time. 

Everyone at that point seemed so heartless. My coworker asked me why I looked so gloomy at work, and when I told her, with tears welling up in my eyes she rolled her eyes and said “Oh stop it. It’s just a bunny.” 

I was star struck. I wasn’t asking for comfort or anything, I was just telling them what they asked. To everyone else my losses are “just bunnies” but they meant the world to me, I loved them, I cared for them, I was attached to them and they were just ripped away from me with no warning. 

I cannot sue, I cannot press charges, I don’t want to. I can’t. I just want my babies back. 

I cried so much I passed out and woke up 2 hours later. Everyone in my life looks so tired of my grieving, even though it’s only been a day, despite me not even bothering them with it, or confiding in them with it. I am hurting alone. 

I have learned a lesson. I will never mourn to those in my life again, because no one else knows my pain like me, and its no one else’s job to care and comfort me. Its my job. 

This has broken so much trust I’ve had with a few people in my life that I don’t think I will ever regain.

Everyone has told me I’m overreacting and that I shouldn’t be so upset, and that I should get over it. And I’m starting to believe it, maybe I’m dragging it. 

I don’t know anymore. I can’t think of anything else but my babies. I can’t eat or do anything. I can’t even shower. It’s like I’ve sunk into a depression over it.

I’m still in a shock, my new born bunny dying, getting told to shut up over it, having to bury him, and the next day coming home when I thought I was getting a little bit better, only to find two of my rabbits gone.

2022-11-26 00:01:31,14,False,3,"I (male 19) am getting unintentionally tortured by my girlfriend (female 19). 

Okay I'll keep this short. Half a year ago I got together with my first ever girlfriend. Before we were together we'd been very close friends for about 9 months, she's absolutely amazing and I could honestly see myself still being with her several years in the future. 

She's extremely kind, very intelligent and incredibly beautiful. But as of right now she doesn't have much of a physical interest in me (something she has plainly stated to me in the past). To clarify it's not cause I'm physically unattractive, I'm 185 cm tall (or almost 6'1) whilst being quite fit and having brawd shoulders and apparently a cute face (according to her), she just isn't interested in anything particularly intimate right now. 

The one time I brought this up with her she broke down crying saying that ""this was one of the reasons she didn’t want to get into a relationship at first, because of the inevitable expectations to be more physically intimate“. Which was the complete opposite of what I had expected when I got in to this relationship, as she could be quite lewd at times when we where friends. 
She then said “that she wanted us to have a slow burn romance and take her time with getting comfortable”, which I quickly agreed to so that I could put her mind at ease and let her be comfortable.

However every time we do one of the few intimate things she's comfortable with (kissing and light cuddling mostly) I am left feeling unsatisfied, wanting for more and miserable at the end. I want her to be happy and comfortable in this relationship, but I'm having a real hard time with it. Idk if it cause I just have a high labido or if it's cause I entered this relationship with different expectations, but it's starting to ware at me. 

I love my gf very much and I want her to be happy/comfortable, but I don't know what to do to make it so that I don't feel miserable after every time we're a bit intimate. So Reddit if you could work your magic and give me any suggestions as what I can do to not feel this way that'd be amazing.",relationship_advice,I could use a bit of advice,8.5,2022-11-26
2022-11-26 00:01:40,1,False,1,"So to start, I’m a guy who’s never been in an actual relationship, and neither has the girl. So It started probably 6 months ago, one of us added each other on social media and she ended up texting me saying she thought I was cute and liked my name blah blah. This happened somewhat often and nothing ever comes from it but then she asked to hangout. 


I said okay even though I thought it was weird as we just met, but 2 days later she picks me up (I couldn’t drive at the time.) We had an amazing time. We got along really well and i could tell she enjoyed it too. We baked cookies at her house, played putt putt, and had dinner. One thing that stuck out to me was that she was very touchy and liked to touch my arms etc. after she dropped me off she leaned in for a hug before I went inside. We hung out a good amount after that, but a big thing I noticed was that she DID NOT answer her  texts. 


She rarely responded to texts, and I mean for days, and she previously has mentioned that she is bad at texting and rarely does it, but if I call her she answers almost every time. We continued hanging out a lot after that, got shakes, sat under the stars and had deep conversations, it was amazing. The best times I’ve ever had and I’ve never felt this way about anyone ever. Fast forward to July. I invite her over to swim and hangout with some of my friends for my birthday. We swim and hangout, it is good. 


She wrote me a hand written card that was very sweet and took her a lot of time along with a gift card. After my party, we went a long time without talking since like I said she never responded to texts. 

But eventually we hung out again and went to see a movie. I wanted to make a move and kiss her eventually but since this was my first time doing all this with a girl this much, I settled on holding her hand while we watched a movie. After we got to my house and she was about to leave, I told her I liked her and she said she liked me back. She had to get back for curfew and that was the last time we ever hung out. 


I called probably weeks later asking about school and stuff, and at that time, I was losing hope that we were gonna keep hanging out and thought the call would we dry, but she talked a lot and sounded happy to talk. But once I brought up how last hangout ended, she got super tense and changed the subject, and said she had to finish the movie with her mom. (Which I called in the middle of) that made me pretty sad and later, I sent a text basically just telling her how I felt about the situation and why she never responded yet every time we hung out, she seemed to enjoy it and was flirty with me. 


She responded saying that she really enjoyed hanging out with me,but that she needs to focus on school, and wants to get into a good college to get away from her parents, (she told me her dad was a pretty mean alcoholic) she had terrible anxiety and had a 504 due to it. I said I understand and am here for her whenever she needs me. 


School went on I was pretty depressed. Fast forward to like a month ago, I texted asking how she’s doing. That’s all. No answer. Months later I’ve have a week off school so I text asking to get dinner and catch up. To my surprise she actually responds and she says “yeah for sure, however this week I’m like crazy busy” fair, because I was too. I asked her plans for thanksgiving and she hasn’t answered since. It’s been 6 days. 


I know it sounds like she just isn’t interested anymore. I know I know. But i really like her. Really like her. The thought of her makes my stomach drop thinking about all the things we did together. I can’t even drive past a place that we went to without feeling shitty. I know I should just move on, but she was different and I really felt we had something going. I can go more into depth on all the things she actually did when we hung out that made it seem like she liked me back. plus, she even said she did. The most confusing thing is that she would not text back for days on end yet, when we hangout we both have amazing times,  


I just need advice and help. I know y’all with probably just say to move on which deep down I know I should, but if you have any other advice I’d truly appreciate it.

I haven't. to be honest I'm not the best writer (which is one of the reasons I'm asking this), I just wanted to help her anyway I could. everyone who has read her essays haven't made a complaint so again, maybe it's just me being an ass. the thing is she's applying to very selective schools (10 to 15% acceptance rates) and most are far from our home state. This is an important detail.

when I read her essays they were well...generic and contradictory. Nothing about them stood out. I didn't want to discourage her, I gave my thoughts to her really gently but they were still taken as she was a privileged idiot. 

Here's a few examples to better understand - one of the essay questions was what academic challenge she faced and what she learned from it. It starts off with her complaining how she use to spend 11 hour days at school because she was in clubs. She said she hated it because it drained her mental health, took her away from her family, and she HAD TO BUY HER OWN DINNERS instead of having them served for her.  this was for one of the very selective schools 27 hours away. I told her she should reconsider what she said because a school like this want's someone who can do long, intensive days without complaining and she'll be 27 hours away from her family. The dinner thing also made her seem irresponsible. 

another example was what impact she'd like to leave at the school and its community. She said she wanted to leave love and friendship and she wants to start doing nicer things for people such as leaving quarters near a vending machine.

We can all recognize that a kid with a 120 IQ is ""bright"" and ""going places."" Yet we can't recognize that a kid with 80 IQ (equally far from average) is likely to struggle in life. Often, the 80-IQ kid is expected to go through school with no special support. Then we act surprised when they drop out because the work was just too hard. 

So many people are being diagnosed with emotional problems when really they're just not that bright. No amount of medication can make up for slow processing. Of course these conditions are very real. But labels like ADHD and depression should be reserved for otherwise bright/average kids who struggle in one particular area, rather than slow kids who (predictably) struggle in everything because they're slow.

Examples:

- He takes fistfuls of food, and literally shoves it in his mouth, not caring about anything that drops down. He will do this until it’s gone. This is anything from fries to chips to small pieces of food. He will chew the food from his hand.

- He eats every meal as if it’s his last. HUGE portions in his mouth all at once and inhaling it as quickly as possible. He has a great metabolism, so this repeats 2-3 times.

These aren’t dealbreakers, but… they’re irritating. He’s never commented on me, and I’m pretty conservative, I guess, in how I eat.

He doesn’t chew with his mouth open, smack his lips, or make weird sounds when he eats. It’s just those two things. It’s like I’m having a meal with a literal food eating competitor.

2022-03-30 22:09:00,6,False,2," I'm having issues with my girlfriend \[18F\] and a shared friend \[19F\] we have. It started when i was with our friend (we'll call her ""S"") in a certain building on our college campus. My girlfriend (we'll call her ""L"") was in class at this time. The three of us were gonna get covid tests at 1pm that day and L was in a class until 12:20. The way Tuesdays usually work was that I have a class at 9:30-10:50 and I stay in that building with S until 12:20, when L's class is over, and she usually comes over to meet S and I to discuss the afternoon's plans. However, because of the covid test, things went differently. As I was walking to class with L earlier that morning, I suggested we go to get food after her class and then head to get covid tests. However, I assumed that L would still come to the building where S and I would be while L was in class. Around 12, S suggested that we get the covid test first and then eat afterwards, staying in the building until it was time to get tested. I agreed, and thought that either (A) S would text L and tell her this plan, or (B) L would come meet us as usual and we would tell her then. I was incorrect. L got out of class 10 minutes early and headed straight to the food building. She texted us, but discord is weird and neither of us got notifications until it was too late. So S and I went there and met L and we got our covid tests, but L was upset that we made a plan and didn't tell her.  This whole issue was a lack of communication.  However, this put L in a bad mood for the rest of the day. To make matters worse, L got her period later as well which she says made her extra moody. That evening, S texted us if we were busy because she was having a mental breakdown over the recent suicide of someone who was our friend, but none of us were really that close to her. As L was having a bad day, she didn't really want to have to comfort S, as she wanted the night to herself (with me being there).

For context, S has a mental handicap that prevents her from understanding a lot of things, so S didn't understand why L wanted me there but not her.

They are both trying to get each other to understand their POV's, but neither of them are really succeeding and it's only escalating. I attempted to help but it failed. The way I see it is that S wants L to acknowledge that L had hurt S, and L wants S to know that she doesn't want to be the therapist friend and always be there when S needs her. I understand the way everyone is feeling here but I can't seem to make either of them understand. And now I'm stuck in the middle of this and I don't want to loose either of them because I care about both deeply, just in different ways. And I do not know what to do about any of this.

I know this sounds very ungrateful of me, and I should be happy my mother took time out of her day to clean my room but she knows that if and when I want her help (cleaning-wise) I will ask for it. 

That is why she purposely waits until I am out of the house for extended periods of time to come into my room (which is messy, but not outrageously messy) and change everything about it. She doesn’t just put my laundry back, she moves things around and snoops through my stuff. I think she has some sort of undiagnosed OCD because by the end of it, my room doesn’t look like my room any more, it’s completely devoid of character and white and bare. I don’t want her looking through my private possessions and finding things I’d rather keep private from her. 

 I don’t know why but when things are done a certain way, I get really quite irrationally angry. I’ve never taken it out on people I’ve just paced and tugged on my own hair. But today I came home from babysitting (at around 10.30, after leaving at 7.30) and found that my room had been ‘cleaned’ again, this time by my mother AND my younger sister. 

I really don’t know how to put into words how much I hate this, to me it is a total breach of privacy and boundaries. I have told her multiple times that I like my room the way it is and that if I ever need help cleaning (which I undoubtedly will) I will ask her. I have also told her that I don’t like her coming into my room when I’m not home. However, she seems to just ignore that and do as she pleases.

I digress, so I’m back home. I’m tired, sweaty and now angry (that same irrational anger mentioned above, that I realise is irrational but just needs to be felt sometimes) and she decides to try and come into my room. She knocks, I tell her not to come in, she opens the door anyway and I close it back on her saying that “I’m not in the mood to talk right now”.

They have an unhealthy relationship where they get into arguments all the time and they talk shit about each other behind their backs and Darrell is the one that starts it all. 

Yesterday, at lunch, we were all done with Darrell bullshit when de first said the f slur. Me and my friends are a part of the LGBTQ+ Community and Darrell is homophobic so me and Chelsey called him out for it and then he went on to say that if he woke up one day then he could say the n-word.

Eventually she gets exposed and convicted of defrauding investors of billions of dollars. She also knowingly put people in serious life-threatening danger with her medical tests which didn’t work.

My partner &amp; I live in Europe and after almost 15 years of hardwork we have recently bought our first home and we’re excited to move in with our baby boy in a couple of months. Being from an Asian family, both of us have the responsibility to take care of our parents who live in Asia. So effectively we run three households. Additionally my partners sister and child lives with my partners parents as she separated from her husband, so although she works, we still take care of all the combined needs of their household.
Now I have no problem with this situation and I have been supportive of her decisions and all the money my partner ends up spending on her demands which has included buying a home for the parents and her to stay in at her preferred expensive location, decorating it to her lavish standards and even paying all their recurring utility bills and basic household expenses! 
However she thinks this is my partners duty towards her! And my partners parents and my partner too think this is ok and part of their culture.
I had made my peace with all of this. But recently I totally changed how I feel about her because after our son was born, she did a lot of manipulative and unkind things that pitted my partner against me and caused a lot of issues in our relationship. After 8 months of suffering I had an outburst and luckily my husband heard me out and since then we’ve tried to maintain boundaries with her and keep her away from interfering in our personal lives.
Now…back to our new home! My partner is already hinting that once we get possession of our new home, that we would be obliged to invite his sister and child to come on a holiday to Europe and stay with us for a few weeks. We already will have to invite our parents to stay with us on a rolling basis (every year) and it is expensive arranging for their travel as it is but we will do it happily. I just think having my sister in law and her child come visit us is unnecessary and a bit over the top.

So I get home last night, and I realize that I haven’t done much laundry in a while. I gather up all my clothes, and go to put them in the washing machine. When I open it, I see that my stepmom has her clothes in there, and there’s towels that are finished in the dryer. So, I go ahead and I fold up all of the towels and go put them away. Then, I set the dryer to delicates (she has some really nice clothes that look fragile, so I dried them delicate so that hopefully I wouldn’t mess them up), and I throw my clothes in the wash. After her clothes are dried, I fold them all up carefully, and lay them on top of the washing machine since I can’t go into their room while they’re asleep. 

I wake up this morning, and my stepmom is acting super cold towards me. I don’t understand why (she’s normally not very chatty towards me, but we’re civil I guess), and so I ask my dad. He tells me that she’s upset that I messed with her laundry, and that she was pissed off that I touched her clothes at all.

2022-05-31 04:31:17,3,False,1,"My fiancé and I met about 4.5 years ago and went on our first date together. We lived in the same city and then about 8 months later she went to dental school in another part of the country. 

We had a very brief break at the time of starting long distance in which I made out with a friend while drunk. I was open with my fiancé (gf at the time) about it and we put it behind us and ended up getting back together and moving on while doing long distance. 

For the next couple of years I sort of skated by in the relationship. This has been a common theme in my life where I’ve felt more like a spectator than active / intentional decision maker. She was incredibly busy in school and I at work and so we’d see each other as much as possible but it was only about 1x a month due to the distance. Back home I’d still go out with my friends, partying and drinking most weekends. I’d flirt with other girls at times but never cross the line physically and without ever physically cheating I’d sometimes text girls from my past or even new ones that I would develop a new even if temporary emotional connection with if I was drunk. 

Fast forward to the past two years and my fiancé and I have been able to see each other much more and our relationship became more serious and fulfilling. She was able to finish school within a few hours of where I live and it made life much easier. Eventually, I asked her to marry me fairly recently and we are planning to get married next year. She is now moving in with me as she begins a 4-year contract in the city I live in. 

I am posting because I feel I have been a passive participant in the relationship from day one. She is an amazing person and we typically have an awesome time together but we can also have huge fights at times. I have been lukewarm happy in the relationship, but felt like getting engaged was the next logical step given she’d be attempting to move to my city for the foreseeable future rather than a decision I made because i had found the one or the love of my life or someone I could never live with out. I also am a believer that happiness is a choice and that I can make a beautiful life with her even though I doubt at times whether I took the best possible route to find the one. 

Writing this post in and of itself is therapeutic for me. I have been hesitant for the entirety of the relationship to share too many details with friends because I was worried what they would think or say, but I realize I should have sought outside advice long ago and tried to be more intentional over the course of our relationship. 

TLDR - engaged, but the hard truth is I wouldn’t say I can’t imagine life without her or that she is the absolute only love of my life / one for me. I love her, but I’m not fully confident in our future life together.

2022-07-20 23:12:35,7,False,7,"This may be long but I need to add context because it's been a while in the making. I appreciate you guys reading. 

I was part of that family with two parents who stayed together for the kids. I do feel like my parents did well but from when I was 16, it got bad. Shouting matches, accusations of cheating towards my dad, just vile language and gaslighting. My mum (44F) always tried to turn me against my dad (46M) and guilt tripped us when we truly began to bond as father and daughter. If I wanted to go to an European football match with my dad and uncle, if I showed interest in going to a car show. It was pretty much like she wanted me to hate him and not give a damn. I'll be honest, no one in my friend group knew what my mum was like and no one realised until the last few months.

Three years ago, nearly to the day, I got into a severe argument with my mum about her taking me to the capital in our country (I live in the UK) so I could meet up with my dad to go to a friendly match. She suddenly backed out, declaring I'd take the tram, which I hadn't done before, to this stadium. 70,000 people were supposed to be there. SEVENTY THOUSAND and she expected her 18 year old daughter to go on her own. My dad got angry and this caused an argument, leading her to tell me I'm grounded for going behind her back to grass her up. I got told to take what I needed and leave. So I did, I went to my granddad's just up from my house and this caused a major meltdown. I ended up having a massive panic attack on the phone to my best friend and his mum. I still managed to go and really enjoyed myself. But then the journey home was hell, I knew there was going to be a massive argument but I was told that my best friend was allowed to come and get me out of there. However, to my shock, my mum was gone. Packed and left. My older brother (23M) had no idea where she went. 

The three of us left, my dad, my brother and I, sat down and discussed what we were doing. My brother made it clear he was staying with my dad and I was told to think about it since I was actually quite close to my mum. I decided to stay with my dad, especially with my college coming up since I had just graduated high school. She never came back but she did try multiple times to get back into our family dynamic but failed miserably. My mum now lives where I escaped to on the day she walked out, only two minutes from us and she still lives there now.

Over the next couple of years, our relationship has many ups and downs. Lots of guilt tripping, falling out and emotional blackmail. Now, I'm a very forgiving person and my two best friends know this quite well as I had to forgive them before for stuff outwith their control. I allowed myself to be and stay hurt by my mother for a while. But, this got worse in the last six months.

When the pandemic began, my dad actually started to date his best friend L (48F) of over 23 years. Remember the accusations of cheating? Yeah, that's because my mum was convinced that the pair of them were at it ever since I was a baby. Now L is possibly the best thing to ever happen to our family because she's a strong parental figure and loving partner to my dad and he holds her on a pedestal for everyone to know. However, I was told to not tell anyone about them. Meaning my mum. So, I avoided questions about them for 18 months because she lost the right to know anything about my dad when she left. My best friends agreed with this and helped too as they had contact with my mum too. Now, she only found out this year about my dad and L, which led to her ranting at me for over two hours on the phone. She accused me of lying and I lost it because she started attacking my brother and dad. It was not pretty and she told me to ""go burn in hell with your brother and dad"". What was better? This happened a week before my 21st birthday and when it rolled round: nothing. No card, no text, no gift. She pulled out of a birthday bowling trip with my group of friends and demanded her money back. My family were horrified and disgusted by this. I had an amazing birthday weekend thankfully but it still hurt a lot. 

I was so torn up about what happened and I leaned on my two best friends, W (21F) and S (20M), and a close friend A (21F). S and A were shocked at what happened and offered a lot of support, which I needed. However, W and her boyfriend T (20M) picked me up the day after it happened and took me for food to talk. We sat in his car and T told me that he believed that my mum was treating me like a friend, not a daughter. Let alone an adult. Now, I was angry that he said this but W chipped in and told me about instances that I won't bring up with my mum's attitude towards me. It was like their words got me thinking. I stayed low contact with my mum for about 4 weeks as I dwelled on some stuff. I realised my mum had seriously screwed with my mental health in so many ways. I needed a break. I needed space.

Now, to what happened officially a week ago as I type this. My mum had called me twice in an hour and I finally answered. I was annoyed because I was planning to make my dinner and she was acting quite fake, which is what she does before ranting at me after we've not spoken for a while. I let her go on before I got annoyed and asked her what she wanted and told her I meant I needed space, not when she chose to contact me. This blew back on me and led to a massive argument. A lot of vile shit was said on her part and I can't say some of it but one thing she did say: she implied that S, when he used to walk me two minutes back home when I stayed at his house, probably was going to attack me. He had a girlfriend at the time. I was horrified and disgusted. She doesn't think mental health exists because ""You can't be picky when you want to talk to me!"" 

Woman, you literally raised me to be polite. I didn't answer because I was busy and NEEDED MY SPACE. I told her she made me not want a relationship with her and so, she ""disowned"" me. Told me to never contact her again. After three years of this be, I finally blocked her number. S, W, T and A were all so proud of me for standing my ground and finally ending contact. I did actually end the call and literally went crying to my dad because he knows how sensitive I am to this stuff but he's a real one, knows how to cheer me up. 

It's been a week. I feel so much happier. I have a football game on Saturday with my grandad. However, I do have to see her for that since we go through and watch the same team. I don't really care now because she's irrelevant.

I appreciate you taking the time to read this because I wanted to finally write my feelings in a healthy way. I feel I may write more stories about my mum. Maybe not. I don't know. But thank you for reading a ramble!

It started with drinking while playing video games with my friends over voice chats, then evolved into drinking whether or not I was playing with my friends, to hiding out to drink alone in my apartment at least three times a week. Eventually I started strategically getting drunk at 5pm so that I could pass out early and sleep off the hangover before work the next day. 

I've become more and more sluggish. I used to be lean but now I weigh nearly 250lbs. I have made it such a huge habit to get mega shitfaced alone that every time I know I'll be unbothered all evening I instinctively drive to the grocery store and get a bottle of liquor and a mixer, then come home to play games/watch TV/shitpost on the internet until I pass out halfway through my anti-hangover water chug.

Yesterday was one of those days. After work I went to the grocery store and just thought ""no, not anymore"" and left. I drove back twice. I kept walking past the liquor aisle over and over. The store employees must have thought I was planning on shoplifting. After my third trip back I just bought some ice cream and went home. It felt weird not getting drunk on a Wednesday knowing I had all afternoon to myself. Finally I just sat at home and started reading a book that I bought last year but never opened.

we live with our paternal grandparents and parents. my mother and grandpa implemented a rule that on weekends, we have to be awake and downstairs by 8:30am. this is a problem for me and ally because she works a lot while being in college and i have issues sleeping. 

occasionally, one or more of us will sleep through our weekend alarm due to exhaustion and come downstairs around 10 or later. today was one of those times. tay and i had gone to our high school’s football game and were out late because i had to drop off a few friends. we had gotten home around 11:30pm and ally was up waiting for us to make sure we got home safe.

I even go on dates. It’s all for nothing though, because while I’m on them, I just think about how I’d leave anyone for him. Which makes me feel sad and pathetic. I know he’s no good for me. I know it. He knows it. The ADA and state we live in knows it. One time he told me he was sorry because he felt like he changed who I was.

Then he called me at 3 in the morning 4 times days later. I never called back. I never texted. I told myself to just ignore it/him. Then I posted a pic on my IG story, followed by a video. I deleted it soon after. I got a text from him though. It made me snap. Fortunately I was tired and fell asleep before sending my text lol.

At first I scheduled my flight for Sept 17, which had to be cancelled and rescheduled to Oct 18. They said her surgery would be in the first week of October. I booked airbnbs and several corresponding flights with this October 18 trip which has $4k total sunk into it. I am also completely mentally prepared and ready to go, leaving in 9 days.

She came to me saying that her phone wasn't working and that she needed a new one. I explained to her that I just got her that phone and that I couldn't afford a new one even with the insurance on it. She got mad at me and wouldn't speak to me...the usual teenage move. But ultimately I decided that she did need a phone so that she could call when she had practices/tutoring/ or just being out, so I brought her a $25 dollar flip phone. She got mad that I was making her use it and said that it was embarrassing and that people on her soccer team were poking fun at her for it, but I told her that until she could show me that she would be able to be careful with her phones then I'm not buying her another smart phone.

I am still shocked to hear that I did something like this. She is too. We have talked about it, and she mentioned that its going to take a lot of time for her to trust me again.

So yea, it is pretty normal to me to face catcalling since I was like 12, I got so used to it, but due to my anxiety it still can be hurtful to me even if I know that I should not be so touched by it anymore. But sometimes, strangers catcall me even when my bf is with me, and I am the only one who ""fights back"" he never says a word. In like 70% of catcalling I react, for example I say that I feel sorry for them that they have the need to do this or respond sarcastically to them. But he never does a thing, he doesn't wanna talk about it and it makes me feel, well not that safe with him(I know it's stupid, but that is how I feel)
So, like 2 weeks ago a random guy in our library said to me, out of nowhere that I am dressed like a sl*t, I was just staring at him at that moment, because library was the last place where I would expect this, and I did not even wear something that would show my body. 
But, my bf was not there at the moment, I told him about it and to my surprise he seemed angry about it. Today, we met the guy, I just nodded at my bf that it was him, since he wanted me to let him know if we meet him again, again I was surprised that he wanted to take action, but... the guy was just having fun at the moment. But it could have been so different, my bf is 189cm(6.2 feet) tall and has large shoulders and that guy was like smaller than me, around 175cm(5.74 feet) and thin, so I kinda hoped my bf would make some good move, at least say something, I definitely did not wanted them to start fighting lol, but it ended up pathetically to us. My bf just didn't know what to say to him even when he wanted me to tell him if we meet the guy.

I don't get it, when my girl friends are catcalled/harassed in front of me/or I meet the guy, I make sure that I stand up for them at least somehow, verbally.

2022-03-03 05:20:49,2,False,1,"My (21) girlfriend (19) and I met at a college conference in mid October of last year and we’ve been together ever since. We both go to different schools roughly 5 hours apart from each other, so we’re in a long distance relationship and call each other a few times a week. Both of us go to colleges in different states from where we’re originally from (I go to school about 50 minutes away from where I’m from and she goes to school about 2 hours away from where she’s from). Our hometowns are roughly 6 hours apart from each other.

We’ve visited each other a couple of times since first meeting. During winter break, I drove up to visit her at college, and then we drove to stay at her parent’s place for a couple of days. She then came over to stay with my family at my aunt’s place for a few days to celebrate New Year’s. 

Since we live so far apart from each other, I thought it would be nice to see her again during spring break. Since late January, we’ve talked about planning for me to drive up to her parents’ place on the 14th and stay for a few days, since she’d already be there (her parents were planning on bringing her home on the 11th). 

Here’s the issue. My girlfriend and I both struggle with depression and body image issues. Neither of us are to the point where we can’t function, although I’m doing much better than she is. She also has autism, but I don’t. Sometimes it seems like she isn’t really “there” at times. There are times when we agree to talk on the phone and she doesn’t answer when the time comes. Even when we do talk, it sometimes seems like she isn’t paying attention to me. She skips classes frequently and sleeps through the day to the point where she’s performing poorly in school.

I do my best to try to be there for her and give her all the love and affection I can. I listen to her vent on the phone about how she’s struggling with school and about her problems with her family. Her parents can be very stubborn, judgmental, and arrogant (they were somewhat passive aggressive to me when I first came over to visit and didn’t seem to care for me much). I also compliment my girlfriend often, send her meaningful gifts in the mail, and listen to her talk about her interests too. I’m also the one who’s originated the plans to meet up together each time.

It doesn’t really feel like she does the same for me. Most of our conversations seem to revolve around her and she sometimes ignores me when we’re on the phone because she’s distracted by something else. She didn’t send me anything on Valentine's Day or even call or text me. She told me she was too busy with schoolwork to get me something, but it still hurt. When I came over to visit for the first time, she spent several hours playing on her VR headset instead of talking to me. I never say how these things make me feel because I’m worried about hurting her feelings and seeming like an overly critical boyfriend. Although she does these things, she still acts like she likes me and often tells me she loves me.

Although we’ve been planning on having me come over to visit during spring break since late January and I’ve reminded her to talk to her parents about it several times, she never did. I’m the type of person who likes to do everything ahead of time vs wait until the last minute. I thought that since she still hadn’t told her parents that we’d planned on having me visit during spring break, that I’d just do it myself to give them a heads up. 

I thought it would be good to give them notice ahead of time, so they wouldn’t just be finding out last minute or wondering why I showed up at their door without them expecting me. I honestly thought nothing of it when I sent her mom a text message telling her that I was planning on visiting during spring break in case my girlfriend hadn’t told her already. Her mom replied to me saying she didn’t know, but she was ok with it. She also went on to tell my that my girlfriend has been missing so many things because she’s been sleeping too much and acting angry towards her.

My girlfriend then called me shortly after and seemed mildly irritated with me that I texted her mom that I was planning on coming over instead of letter her do it herself. She said it seemed like I was trying to invite myself over and that it wasn’t right of me to overstep and talk about the plans with her family without involving her and that “she’s the one who communicates with her family and I’m the one who communicates with my family.”  

I don’t really think that what I did was that wrong honestly. I feel like I was just letting her mom know so she had a heads up. I don’t feel like I was inviting myself over since my girlfriend and I had already talked about this before. I feel like inviting yourself over is when there were no plans ahead of time, and then you suddenly say that you’re coming over out of nowhere. I’m retrospect, I understand why she might’ve been annoyed because her parents started asking her why she hadn’t told them before, and I understand why I should’ve just waited. However, I was honestly frustrated that she still hadn’t told them yet.

2022-03-03 05:23:31,9,False,7,"Okay so this one's sort of tricky, and I get pretty rambly, so be warned. My boyfriend (22m) and I (23f) have been best friends since high school, and decided to try dating about 5 months ago. He moved to another state after high school, so it's long distance, but it was going pretty well! We've called for multiple hours every night to play video games or stream a movie or at least talk, and I love him very much. We've talked about our future a lot, and marriage has been mentioned many times. He always talked about how excited he was to see me, and finally get to be with me in person, and all the things he wanted to do with me. This is the man I picture myself growing old with. 

However.

Three weeks ago he made the trip to visit me. I was super excited, since it was gonna be our first time together since we've started dating. I picked him up from the airport, brought him back to my apartment, and noticed basically right away that something was off? Any sort of affection between us had to be initiated by me, and he was always the first to pull away. I asked him multiple times if anything was wrong, or if he was uncomfortable, or if I needed to pull back, and he reassured me that I was fine. We had a good time overall, did a ton of fun stuff, but it was pretty constant throughout, and I'm not gonna lie, it kind of hurt? Just imagine you're trying to kiss your boyfriend and he cuts you off halfway to talk about something else while you're mid kiss. I brought it up to him towards the beginning of the trip, since I was feeling sort of awkward, and he said he'd try his best to more affectionate, and reassured me that he's just never been in a relationship with someone he's actually cared about before so he's learning how to approach it, which I totally get. He's been in some really shitty relationships, and I never want to pressure him into something he's not comfortable with. 

On the final day though, he finally admitted it. His reluctant behavior had continued throughout the whole trip and I asked him if he was even attracted to me, to which he said he wasn't. He explained that he had never really been attracted to ANYONE he's dated, and that he thought it might be different with me in person, but it just. Wasn't. He said that he still thought I was pretty, and that he loved me very much, but that he didn't want me in that way, and doubted he ever would. Every time I had kissed him he had just dealt with to make me happy. 

Now I understand that it's not something wrong with me personally. I can't change the way he feels and I would never want him to lie or have to act a certain way to appease me. But I am a very insecure when it comes to my appearance, especially since I've never been in a relationship before. I feel like no one's EVER really been attracted to me until my boyfriend. He would always tell me over the phone how much he wanted me and whatnot, and for him to 180 on that upon being with me in person again after years makes me feel SO shitty. I don't feel wanted anymore, and it makes me feel sick. Like, was he just lying to me or did he not realize that he didn't feel that way until he saw me? I love kissing and physical affection, but I feel awful knowing he only puts up with it for me. Either way it's caused a rift in our relationship. He's gone back home now, and all of our calls since then have been awkward. I hate it.

I love this man. He loves me. My FAMILY loves him. I don't want to break up with him, but I don't know how to deal with or approach this.

She never spoke, even for a question, Not even to the teachers, She was struggling, and when I would see her all alone I'd sit with her, not many words were exchanged and her art was gorgeous, she was skilled, and I supported that. I asked her if I could pay her to draw her favorite flower, I gave her $40. The next day she returns with a spider lily watercolor painting, I cherished it and appreciated the fact she did it for me despite rarely talking with me.

She was bullied, I knew she was bullied, there were four kids in history class that would look at her and whisper cruel things, one took a photo of her and she had noticed, her expression had fallen from one of neutral, to sadness, misunderstanding, and it hurt to see her that way, I stood, didn't confront the kids, asked to use the restroom and told the faculty about these kids, I believe they scolded these kids but it only made it worse and worse, I always reminded her that she was very lovely and that she had real talent unlike those kids, I was supportive and my own friends jumped the bandwagon and helped support her to, She began hanging out with my group, I was glad to see her. The first time I had ever seen her smile and laugh was around me and my friends, I thought I had done something.

Well, Christmas Break comes around and I bought her a gift , A huge box of art supplies, paper, Copic pens, and bought her some beat headphones, I put them in a cardboard box, ready to see her as school the next day to deliver my new delights, I carried the box there , entered class and sat at my usual spot, she wasn't there, I hadn't been worried at first until she was gone for 4 weeks, I was shattered , I was hoping she didnt switch schools on me and even scaled Facebook to find her, I found her mothers account. But not hers.

""Hey, Its E, I've got some gifts for her. I wanted to ask if I could drop em off."" 

There was silence for several hours until I finally got a response, not a text, but a phone call, I wish I had never picked that damn phone up, I didn't know picking up would destroy me completely, 

She had taken her own life after the four bully kids followed her home and tore her art to shreds, calling her shitty.

But what really pushed me past the line were these words her mother spoke.

""She had high functioning autism, she was too shy to meet other people , But one day, she came home with a big smile and it filled me with joy, she spoke nonstop about you being her newest friend and that you loved her art. I'm sorry."" 

I didnt respond. 
I couldn't.

I failed her.
I should have tried harder..
I could've tried harder..

But It was too late now, what was done was done. 

I got an invitation in the mail , inviting me to her funeral, And I had given my respects, brought along the presents I got for her. And put them down in the grave with her for her to cherish in the afterlife.

I wish I could have stopped it.
I wish. 

I'm sorry.

before i start:
1. i'm a full-time high school student and am 17.
2. i pay for ALL of my gas, and help pay for my car to the best of my ability. i also pay for a lot of stuff on my own. basically anything that isn't a necessity.
3. the issues with my car have been going on since my mom had it in 2019.
4. my car has not been looked at by a professional. not even once. just a scan to confirm the knock sensor issue, and a friend who fixes cars as a hobby.
5. i cannot afford to pay for all of the repairs. i can't work full time because of school and extracurriculars. however, i've expressed my willingness to help save up for it many times.

so, my car's knock sensor went out in 2019 when the car belonged to my mom (2014 hyndai sonata... amirite). she never got this fixed, not even after scanning to see if it was the sensor. on top of this, the car has 114k+ miles on it due to my mom driving it for work like crazy, and she never got it serviced regularly; maybe 3 oil changes since 2017. 

after researching a ton, i've concluded that it's probably spark plugs going out (my car gets 15 MILES TO THE GALLON if i'm lucky... it's a hyundai), the engine mounts going out (i cannot accelerate without it shaking), and something with my suspension or steering column (my steering wheel rattles like a mofo). it hardly goes 55 mph anymore, accelerates like dog shit, and it's stalled out before. i need a way to get to work, school, extracurriculars, and act/sat/dual enrollment testing, and my car isn't safe. i've almost gotten in so many accidents or dangerous situations because of how bad the car runs. 

my family isn't exactly poor or disadvantaged. my mom just got a new car and is paying for it just fine, my dad chooses to drive an older one, the bills are paid, and we have a bunch of stuff we want, but don't need. had this been 5 years ago, i'd understand financial stuff. however, we aren't financially disadvantaged anymore, and i've offered to help pay. but they just WILL NOT have anyone look at it.

recently, i've been much more vocal about getting it fixed, and my parents just get mad at me when i try to push forward about it more. i've said i don't feel safe driving anymore, it runs awful, i'm scared to drive, etc., but money is brought up, or it becomes ""ask your father."" maybe ""bring it up later."" 

am i the asshole? i really don't know anymore. i try to bring it up politely and i'm extreme grateful to have a car, but i won't have a car anymore if it keeps running like this, y'know? i feel really guilty because we've had monetary issues in the past, but i sometimes feel like my life is in danger when i drive.",AmItheAsshole,AITA for asking my parents to get my car fixed?,20.5,2022-04-20

When I started my job *in September 2021, I worked a week long training to prep me on restraints, OSHA, Abuse/Neglect, the whole 9 for what I would be responsible for.
They informed me during this week that it was my job to enforce rules, and frankly that I'd probably receive physical backlash from my clients.
A week ago they raised pay from 12.75 to 16 an hour, and have begun cracking down on what they deem as human rights violations against our clients. Let me remind you, they taught us we were enforcers.

A month ago via house meetings we were given basically a whole retcon on how we operate as supports in our clients lives. Not as enforcers, but as someone to assist prompting towards better choices, but ultimately still leaving decisions to our clients.


Two months ago I wrote an Incident Report(IR) which detailed how I warned a client I was going to pull their hand from the fridge(this is like 3 minutes into the incident), did it, and she hit me for it. Now, due to our pay increase, they're suddenly taking interest in ensuring the staff is acting properly. And I'd like to say being a DSP isn't black and white. You often have no time to properly react, and mistakes happen. However a commitee for human rights isn't going to understand that just by reading an IR. *Which they never properly trained us on writing

This has been my only mistake, and I learned from in after the retcon. This one tiny slip up in phrasing on my IR has now lead to me needing to take 7 hours of training on abuse/neglect, human rights, and proper restrictions(which I followed to the best of my abilities in that situation), all because they raised our pay and are now ""cracking down"" on staff issues.


One. Mistake. In a situation where I was trying to assist my client in being properly prepared for her program by not taking excess food. If they didn't care when I was being paid 12.75, I don't see why they should care now that I'm being paid 16.

2022-05-08 03:39:03,3,False,1,"hello, this is my last resort as i have no clue what to do. a few months ago i (F,20) felt really lonely as i had spent a lot of time with my boyfriend (M,20) and kinda just distanced from friends, not on purpose though. so i had asked him if i could download bumble or hinge and go onto the friend option since i’ve seen it before, have used it, and been successful with that side of the app with no romantic intent. he immediately said no and clowned me for it. I said okay, and moved on. He told his roommate about it to jokingly brought it up, meanwhile it was a private conversation that I wasn’t expecting to be shared. He had noticed it made me upset that he shared the information, and apologized. 

Fast forward to a week ago, i’m bringing him food I just cooked and I glance at his phone that’s open, with the app “Tinder” in his siri suggestions. We’ve been together for 9 months, there shouldn’t be any reason it’s on there. I point it out, and he goes “I have no clue why that’s on there” and I say okay and proceed to eat my food in the dining room. He comes up to me after and nonchalantly asks how my food is, looking very flustered. 

I ask him, why? and he explains to me that lately he’s been feeling very lonely due to me being busy… so he downloaded tinder to swipe on the friends side of the page. I dont approach him with yelling, i try to put myself in his shoes and just nod and listen. He’s a very dependent person, and I’m not. I love my alone time, but he despises being alone. He goes on to say that he hadn’t even matched with anymore nor expected to, but of course there’s always an intent behind it. I understand as to why he did it. Just dont know how to feel about the insane amount of hypocrisy behind it. 

Overall, this has built a lot of trust issues for me and I dont know how to continue. On another note, I’m tired of feeling like his caretaker, although I care so much for him. He’s been through a lot of trauma and as an empathic person, I feel very worried for him and wanna make sure he’s doing okay, but it’s just so tiring. I’m disappointed that this happened and I dont wanna break his heart but I miss being happy. Even those who’ve known me for years say i’m not my usual self anymore. I’ve communicated this with him, and he’s willing to help me and change, but i don’t know where to start. I really wanna make this relationship work, I just feel our dynamic is off and I dont know how to fix that.

2022-05-13 19:57:26,1,False,1,"I'm a 23-year-old woman and a single mother of a 2-year-old boy. About a year and a half ago I got on tinder randomly and matched with a really nice guy, we met up and really hit it off. Everything seemed so perfect, we indeed never fought and made each other's lives better. He helped me go back to college and made me feel like a whole person again after being a single mother due to leaving an abusive relationship ( I did take time off of dating to heal before I met him). The issue is, from the start, he told me he was moving in 10 months, so it was just a temporary situation. I agreed to the idea of just hanging out while he was here. We took things really slow because we knew we were going to end. We still ended up falling madly in love with each other and talked about how life without each other was going to be more challenging than we originally thought. We even broke up a few times because the hurt of him leaving made us feel like we should just end it then, but we couldn't stay away from each other and would get back together days later. Before he left we gave each other presents and told each other we loved one another, and then he left to go across the country for a job, and I stayed behind to finish college. Only a few months passed before we started texting each other occasionally to check up on one another. Now we talk every day, and I don't know what to do. We told each other we weren't going to text because we needed to move on from each other before we spoke again, and that once again didn't work because for some reason we can't stay away from each other. Our relationship was like a dream come true, if I could ask myself what the perfect man would be, he would be the man I would describe. The issue is, even though we always talk about how we miss each other and care for each other he never considered the idea of long-distance or just trying to make it work. He has expressed no desire to be with me, but still, we talk every day and I just can't move on. If we aren't going to work I want to move on. But, if there's a chance, I wanna take it. I know I'm young and have plenty of time to love again, but no matter who I find I know they'll never be him, and that crushes me. He's been gone for almost 6 months now and I still feel just as hurt as the day he left. I'm completely lost on how to deal with these feelings. I want to bring this up to him, but he has a lot going on in his life and I feel like talking about what I want from him would seem kind of selfish, especially since he told me from the start we weren't going to be together long term and I agreed to the conditions of him leaving. Do I move on? do I see where this goes? I feel like this is my soul mate, but the distance we would have to have for at least 3 years is a hard issue to navigate. AND  I'm not even sure if he feels the same way I do.

The year after she had the stroke my dad Daniel (61) set up his will and finances accordingly. Now the issue. There was one account that was meant for my mother's care and one account meant to be split up between me (29), my twin Reba (29), and our big sister Rochelle (35). Rochelle is an accountant and my father has been telling her since she was 18 that she would be in charge of my mother's finances after he passes. Rochelle was convinced that my father's life insurance was going to go to the account for my mother's care. It would almost double it. However, she was wrong. The policy ended up going into the account that will be split up 3 ways. This will take my inheritance from 25 thousand to 90 thousand. I am currently pregnant with my first child and this will let me put a downpayment on a house and pay off all of my debt.  It will also let my twin go to grad school. My mother's account will have enough money in it to cover her for almost 25 years before she includes the sale of her house and land which would be at least another 25 years. She is moving into an assisted living space and will have government assistance on top of this account. My sister Rochelle says my twin and I ATA because we refuse to sign over the extra inheritance to my mother and says we are stealing from her because this was not what my dad wanted and he obviously put the policy into the wrong account.

2022-05-17 01:55:22,8,False,0," It's funny how in the summer, a lot of women wear tank tops, but very  few men do. The men that do wear them either are muscular men who wear  them to show off their muscles or men that wear those dingy undershirt  type tank tops that wear them and look like they were too lazy to get  dressed.

But I don't see very many men (especially non-muscular men) wear them  casually during the summer because it's hot out. As a guy, I do wish I  could wear them because here in NYC, it gets so muggy here in the summer  time, especially around July. But I'm not a muscular person, but just  want to wear them because it's hot. And not to mention, short sleeves  give a terrible tan line on the arms. So I would like to wear them  during a warm summer day, but I don't as I would feel out of place since  I would feel like I'm the only guy wearing one outside.

Things were going really well and I was already talking to my mates about her. Im not the kind of relationship person as they are quite foreign to me, so this was, to me, was unexpected and spontaneous. I was already keen on her. the first couple of months it was going well but we had a couple of moments where it was a bit weird. I said some things in a joking manner that may have upset her. I did own up to it and apologise and went back to how we regularly talked and moved on. As well as having real moments, like explaining our previous relationships and experiences. One night we were together after going to a gig in march and back to a hotel we were staying at, I cant remember what i asked her but i needed to have a real conversation with her. It then proceeded to her saying thats shes quite indecisive, impulsive, and doesnt really know what she wants. That in turn did make me feel like ""well, whats the point? that makes me feel quite shitty"" but i didnt say this to her and carried on thinking that this was something ""casual"".  The next time i would see her would have been at a gig in late april. some things did happen inbetween the last time seeing her. we got in a couple of arguments about things and i tried to clear things up with her. She went on about how she might just be better off by herself, some things happened with her family so it was a weird day for her but the next day she apologised and said she wasnt too sure off what she was trying to say, she also said she still wants to see me but doesnt know what she wants beyond that. at the time i said to her dont worry right now, lets just enjoy whatever happens, but i also had to get to work so couldnt talk much. couple of days go by and  i got unwell with glandular fever (i have no idea how i got it), was meant to go to an earlier gig with her and her mates in april but couldnt because of the fever, so i was focusing on getting better. we didnt really talk much during april, kept in contact here and there. when i got better i went to the gig in late april and i was around her and her mates, chilling and talking, she asked how i was doing and how i was feeling, etc. but no flirting or anything cause we were around people. when the band performed it was such an amazing performance but i remember the girl saying that if they would play this one song she would cry her eyes out, and yes they did play that song. as soon as i heard the first few notes i looked at her through some people in between us and she was trying really hard to hold back the tears. basically her ex partner passed away in 2020 and the song reminded her of them. i didnt know what the best thing to do was so i just let her be but kept an eye on her. as the gig finished we both looked at eachother and i went up to her and gave her a hug. we were surrounded by her friends as well so she wasnt alone. just all hugging eachother cause it was an emotional performance. that was the last time i saw her but we still kept in contact, mostly me just messaging her. so now during this month, shes gone a bit cold and not really repsonding back. i posted something funny on my insta story and she instantly repsonded and we had a few chats. she asked how i was but also said ""im sorry for kind of disappearing, you deserve better than that"" I really didnt know what to say to that but i was ranting about some drama to her and didnt really ask her about that. i sent a screenshot of that convo/ comment to some of my close friends asking advice, and they agree that i did deserve better. 

So! here is the part where i asked for advice! Do i keep my composure, show some restraint and keep things chill between us until it feels natural to talk to each other, whenever that happens. Or, do i bite the bitter pill and tell her how i feel about everything, cause despite everything im still keen on her, I want a clear answer.

For example, I had to wait for my Christmas gift one year, while my brother and cousins got their gifts. ( they got computers and game systems and I just wanted a ds that I was promised for my good grades.) I waited like 2 weeks. 

   My moms family is as I would say not a healthy. There is always drama and they would tell anyone who would listen to get them to take sides. As I have gotten older I would be used to vent to as they know I won’t tell anyone. Me being put in a awkward situation and to nervous to give feedback incase they involved me in there drama or being told I’m being disrespectful/rude. I would just sit there and say okay. Even if the situation made me extremely uncomfortable or if I knew it was straight BS. When I was old enough to stay home I would make up excuses to avoid any unimportant events. As that when dramatic talks would happen.

I told her regardless of whether or not that was what is upsetting his system, she shouldn’t be feeding him ANY biscuits and if it is the biscuits, it’s her fault he has the infection. 

My mum got really upset with me saying that I’m an asshole for saying that to her and that she’d never harm coffee. When she went home my step dad started blowing up my phone saying that all dogs more sick as they get old, and that saying my mum might be the cause was horrible.

Before the guests came, he got mad at us for stupid reasons ( one of them was calling for one of us but we were too busy vacuuming so we didn't hear him). The guests arrived and we were hanging out in my bedroom, we were being loud and rambunctious like always. So apparently, Dad was calling us and we didn't hear him, even the guests. We went out for dinner and Dad just singled me and my siblings out and just yelled at us in front of everyone. He was saying stuff like ""You ignore me even though you can hear me"".

It made me sad, this wasn't the first time that this happened. He was yelling at me for something I didn't do, in front of guests (some of them younger and look up to us). So I just went to the room and started crying because that was too much.

Mum came to me and asked if I was upset so I told her. She went outside, took my dad aside and apparently she told him that I was crying because of him. He went inside and coldly told me to go back to the room and ""pretend to be a normal person when I'm done bawling"". 

The rest of the day I was just put in a stink mood and was hardly able to enjoy my own party. Everytime he caught my eye, he'd pull a face ""imitating"" me. I just ignored him but privately told Mum later. 

She was surprised and told me she thought he had apologized to me. She added that he's the one in the wrong and I shouldn't be apologizing for anything.

I found it a little weird since he wasn’t following anyone else from my graduating class but he WAS following former students from a long time ago. 

When I was in high school, I did notice that this teacher took a strong liking to me. He would always use me in psychology class as examples (would ask me questions about myself in front of everyone) and mainly spoke to me (in front of everyone).

the pros: he's handsome, caring, affectionate, giving, loving, charismatic, funny, has a good paying job and loves to cook. We have identical politics and morals and can relate with each other personally on a level that's pretty rare. he has cared for me through long depressive episodes and has taken care of me through major surgeries. he always wants to talk about our feelings and wants and needs. 

the cons: he is always stressed and verbally lashes out at me as a result. when he hurts my feelings, he avoids responsibility by either saying that he was joking, or spiralling out into self flagellation. he makes fun of me and is mean to me to entertain himself but gets upset if i say the same playful mean jokes to him. he has cheated on me at least twice, one of which was with our ex and he hid for over a year. any time he is stressed, i drop everything to care for his needs, yet he still verbally lashes out at me. he welcomes himself to my belongings then gets angry if i ask for them back. i gave him my cat because he was angry about the times he bought things for her. this sucks because when hes yelling at me, if i touch my cat, he gets pissed and says ""how dare you hug the cat, can't you hear I'm still fucking talking to you?"" he expects me to do him endless favors. he doesnt have a car or license so hes been treating me like a chauffeur for years, sometimes even snapping his fingers at me because he thinks its funny. if he hurts my feelings and i tell him, i have to put aside my feelings and comfort him because he acts like he hates himself and wants to die. he doesnt shower or brush his teeth nearly often enough. he cries and says hes a disgusting horrible person when i turn down his sexual advances. when he saw that i was struggling and about to live in my car, he jumped at the opportunity to ask for my possessions. he told me he prefers when im depressed because it makes him feel better about not taking care of himself. he says im lucky to not have friends because they would just make fun of me because of how weird i am. he said im lucky that im not hooking up with anyone else because they would look at my lack of belongings and think i am a loser. i make sure to always gas him up because thats one of the only times he doesn't get annoyed at me talking. he is always critical of my abilities, passions, and dreams. i am constantly actively stifling myself because hes so easily irritated. he gets upset if i hang out with other people, he says its because hes jealous cuz he doesnt have friends. if he wants something, he will whine about how much he wants it, getting louder and more frequent until i give it to him. he insists i spend every moment with him. he says it's because he likes being around me but considering how much he makes fun of me and how often he shows disdain at speaking to me, it feels like he just likes having someone around to vent to, fuck, drive him around, and be his on call thing doer. He knows the way he talks to people is a problem. He has said he had been working on it for almost our whole relationship.

Her parents are extremely conservative in their beliefs. 
She used to sneak out when she was younger, smoke weed, take the car out but this lasted for a bout a year or two. 
This was about 4-5 years ago. 
Her dad ended up bolting the doors shut, taking her phone for days, not letting her out, installing cameras 
About 2 years pass and this is still going on, however she clearly showed change and learnt her lesson. 

 Cue me and her starting our relationship. 
Her dad let me come over, go upstairs but with the doors open. Go out with her on occasion for a few hours. 
However he never let her come to my house and this stayed the case for about a year. 
Her dad always asked for location every time she left the house . 
She would ask to go out and he would say no  threatening to hit her if she asked why or telling her to shut up. 

Enough back story 
- her mom said she would die in fire forever , be a disgrace to the family , saying she will beat her and expose her to the family . scare her and say she would never have another child in her life. (She had an abortion she had at 9 weeks.) 
-Her dad will ALWAYS ask for location no matter where she goes . 
-they force her to help them at work which is an extra shift they do aside from their regular jobs. It is about 2 1/2 hours of cleaning everyday. An hour after they
Both come back from work . If she doesn’t come with them they guilt her and punish her (like no going out ).
-Her dad just has to DEMAND her phone for any reason and she has to give it to him so he can look through it . I have seen it infront of my eyes 
 - she cooks and cleans the house for the fsmily EVERY SINGLE DAY. Her parents sit down on the couch watching tv before work and she brings them the food and plates and drinks 
-she isn’t allowed downstairs after about 10pm.
-her mom has called her crazy and mental when she had o be admitted to an a psych hospital for a few days .
- every time me and my girlfriend have any sort of argument at their house they will get involved and pin any blame on her 

- her mom laughs at her as she cries and begs for her to stop screaming at her and calling her names and speaking down on her. Witnessed this one. Her dad called her crazy for crying and told her to stop being dramatic. 

- Her mom ALWAYS is suspicious of her. What she wears , who she goes out to see and what she’s doing.
Who’s she’s talking to on the phone to

-If she talks back to her mom in any way he screams “cayate” which means shut up NOW in Spanish. 

- They shun her, give her dirty looks, create a problem with her anytime she wants to go out or comes back ( which she does about once a month other than spending time with me.) 

- They call her loca as her nickname, and always call her that, even to me. 

-I am not allowed to go with her to Houston alone when she goes for a week to visit her family 
They say only married people travel together, we’ve been together for 3 years been close for 5. 

-We’ve never had one sleep over, We can’t lay down beside each other infront of him, kiss on the cheek or hug to long. we once went on a road trip; me and her family. Two beds 5 people. Her dad made her sleep on the farthest side of the other bed and me sleeping with him. 



I hope you get th idea because these are just a fraction of things they do to her 


Unfortunately she cannot even move out she is starting college this year and can’t afford housing. 

On the other side they do everything as a family and are very very close. 

They watch an episode of a show every Sunday, spend most of their free time together and have a few friends in the city (most of their family is in El Salvador or Houston or Oregon) 

They share everything , work and stay home  together.  
Being the only daughter with two brothers and does almost everything she can whilst doing school and having her own life 

That’s the issue. It has been so so much of very very happy with them to immediate sadness , fear and and pain. They have done this their whole life, they would hurt her so much emotionally and then immediately make it better without apologizing in any way. 

Everything can be fine for 2 weeks , and out of nowhere  nothing but issues for a few days or a week. For her whole life. 
I can vouch for her that she is the most responsible, and respectful daughters and woman I know. 
She does everything for her parents, NEVER talks back, goes out about once a month with friends, she will only go out with me or to do errands. 

She has cried hours and hours, fell into depression , isolated herself . 
I do everything I can to aid her but her dad has threatened me if I try to to say anything to him telling me it’s his house and not my of my authority. 
(Me and him are extremely close we fix our cars together he lends me tools we work together we show each other funny videos)

2022-10-29 01:23:25,32,False,2,"I don’t give consent for this to be reposted. I need a reality check here and I thought this sub would be a good place to start.

I (31f) live with my bf (44m) of 11 years and my sister (29f). I want to note that my bf and I have a very happy relationship for the most part and we’re basically married (life-events delayed any formal engagements). My sister has been living with us since we moved into our current home a couple years ago. 

BF has not worked since 2019 due to legal troubles and COVID (I don’t want to discuss this). Around the time he stopped working I got a job for a significantly higher salary. The arrangement we made was that he would take care of the house (be a SAHH) and I would work and pay the bills. When he was working we split costs and chores 50/50. 

We have continued this ever since and he has not had to work. I started a new job and it’s very demanding with high expectations, but I’m fortunate enough to earn a good salary and we live quite comfortably. My sister works a retail job full time. I also work full time, remotely 2 days/week and in the office 3 days/week. My commute is almost 4 hours/day. We are childfree and we have 4 cats and 1 dog that I walk. 

Last week, BF and I were talking about my sister. He mentioned how she doesn’t empty the dishwasher, put dishes away, or load the dishwasher much and most of the time this falls on him to do because no one else does it. He said he understands she doesn’t do it if she’s running late for work but she also doesn’t seem to do it much on her days off. He also mentioned how I contribute to the problem - sometimes I leave a cup or a mug out without putting it in the dishwasher and I don’t empty the dishwasher or put dishes away much. I agreed with him and told him that I would put dishes away more so this doesn’t only have to fall on him. 

Later, he mentioned how he’s also the only one to take out the trash/recycling and how this shouldn’t only be his responsibility. He explained doing this along with emptying the dishwasher/putting away dishes can get in the way of making dinner because he tries to clean as he goes but he can’t because everything is full, so he ends up having to delay cooking so he can take care of those things and this annoys him. He said “it’s my job to take care of the house, but it shouldn’t be my job all the time.” 

This is when I got annoyed. I do dishes after dinner some nights, but I don’t clean up/put away as much as I did when we were both working, mainly because I’m tired after work and want to relax on my days off. I understand that taking care of the house is a lot of work. However, he doesn’t work or contribute money to any of the bills, not even to his own personal debts. I pay everything for him 100%. My sister pays rent and sends me money for utilities. I agree with him that taking care of the house shouldn’t be only his responsibility. But it also shouldn’t be only my responsibility to work and pay the bills.

I like Quinn a lot, and we usually get along pretty well. They're a bit quirky and nerdy, which isn't typically what my friends are like, but they're funny and pretty nice.

**For backstory:** I'm a single parent. There was a solid two years between this relationship and the last major one before it; in that time I dated no one, focused on myself and my kid, and discovered that I am genderfluid. Kiddo (5 yo) has never had a father figure; her bio dad was abusive, so I ran away and got a protection order. Ever since then, I've ruined the few healthy relationships I was in by either rushing in, being too indifferent, running away, or a combination of those. In the two years that I was single, I was able to reflect on myself and go to therapy. Last October, I decided to start talking to people again. While I wasn't sure what I wanted, I knew that I couldn't go into it with low standards like before. I raised my standards exponentially this time; I'm not talking appearance, as I could care less; but their interests and goals and such. After a couple weeks of dating apps I met my most recent ex.

We hit it off great. Each week, we'd make 2 sets of plans: first while kiddo was at school, second during the weekends when my parents could watch her. I had made a point to tell him that I didn't want him meeting her or my parents yet, and he agreed to go at my pace. However, I started to let the relationship get to my head, and I ended up pushing things too quickly. I didn't ask him to do anything he wasn't comfortable with--we made it a point to discuss things openly, including our concerns. Or at least, he did... My main concern was that I was letting things progress too fast, but his response would just be to, ""let things progress naturally."" I'm an anxious, depressed, PTSD-riddled mess who either intentionally sought out bad partners or botched good relationships for fear of being hurt. I've come to realize that there's no such thing as ""natural progression"" for me..

Two weeks before xmas (3 weeks into the relationship), we had plans to hang out while kiddo was at school, but I cancelled because kiddo was sick. She and I both have relatively low immune systems, so later that week kiddo got me sick too. When the next week came and I was too sick to hang out--even though kiddo was back in school--he first reacted annoyed, and then throughout the day his aggravation progressed until he called me that night to argue over my cancelling. He claimed I was avoiding him, and that since he ""paid for everything"" (he was always adamant on this even after I protested on our first few dates) that all I had to do was show up when we make plans. It wasn't as if I cancelled an hour before a dinner reservation--we spoke early that morning and our plans were in flux. We argued for a couple hours before I got him to see that he was being paranoid, and he apologized for his reaction.

Over the next two weeks, we hung out a couple of times and spoke regularly. We made plans for xmas and NYE--he came over on xmas and meet my family, and I went with kiddo to his place on NYE to introduce her to his family (who I had already met) and set off fireworks. We also shared a picnic at the park with kiddo in between those two holidays, and the two of them were getting along great. There were a couple other dates during that time that I had to cancel--one due to sickness, another due to a scheduling error with my parents, AKA my designated sitters--and his reactions to both times varied. For the sick one, he was genuinely concerned over my health--and since it occurred right before xmas, that our plans for that weekend might be ruined. For the one where my parents ditched last minute, he was beyond pissed, and sort of acted as if he wasn't going to ever be able to see me... Even though we had plans for NYE, which was the following day. He got over that last one after a couple hours, so things were looking up.

New Year's Day, he brought kiddo and me back home, and we made plans to chill the next day. My cousin called a little after he dropped us off; relatives from my bio dad's side were driving up the next day and wanted to see us. They were bringing my little sis, who I haven't seen since before kiddo was born, so I jumped at the opportunity. I called him up immediately to let him know about the change in plans. I could tell he was put off, but he insisted that he was fine and that I should have fun with my family. To make up for it, we made plans for the following weekend.

That Monday: my parents and I were very sick with what we eventually discovered to be C-19. I preemptively cancelled our plans for that weekend, which he was fine with. He wanted for me to get better, and told me he'd take me to an urgent care/ER if no one else would (we didn't know what we had yet, plus mine was made worse by a bronchial infection). I agreed; Tuesday came, I felt worse and hadn't been to a doc yet. My dad convinced me not to go to a doc yet, so BF insisted that I go with him on Wednesday if I wasn't better. Wednesday, I was feeling a bit better--not by too much, but I was able to walk around and eat. He heard that and asked if our weekend plans were back on. I said no, since I didn't know how much better I'd feel by Friday and I didn't want to cancel on him again. Somehow this started a huge argument--him upset that I wasn't ""putting in any effort"" or ""making him a priority,"" and me that he would get upset over my being sick and having to cancel plans. It also put me off that he would ask a parent to make him the priority in their lives, when I'm not even a priority in my life, kiddo is. We broke up, and I ignored his calls and texts while I processed things. He's a big talker, and I'm easily influenced, so I didn't want to hear from him anymore until I felt ready to talk again.

It's been 2 weeks since then, and in that time he's reached out here and there to apologize, check up on me, catch me up on his life, and ask me to give him another chance. The most recent call came in a couple hours ago. I told him I would think about it, and I meant it--I really care about him, and he seems to genuinely care about my kid and me, so I don't want to lose possibly the best partner I've ever had. He told me I was being dramatic for asking for time to think and drawing it out, but then told me to call after 9pm when kiddo's asleep to give him my answer. He said he'll understand if I don't call, but I get the feeling that if I don't he'll just reach out another day. I don't like having a deadline for something like this, but what if I'm wrong and this really is the last chance we have to fix things? I spent the better part of these 2 weeks considering the future, my ideas of what an ideal relationship is, and whether or not to get back with him. I reflected on all the things I did wrong--letting him meet my family so soon, getting him accustomed to weekly dates when that might not always be a possibility, and not sitting him down and setting boundaries. If we were to try again, I want to actually take our time and go at MY pace, not his or the ""natural"" pace, but a slow pace that I'll feel comfortable with. I'd also keep our relationship separate from kiddo until I felt ready to let him back in... But again, that's if I agree.

It's almost nine and my question is: **what should I do?** Should I get back together with him, give him a chance to grow from his mistakes, and set boundaries and my own pace? Or should I wash my hands with this short yet emotional rollercoaster of a relationship?

# TLDR: I dated a guy for almost a month and a half who showed signs of co-dependency, paranoia, distrust, and emotional immaturity, and he's been calling me for 2 weeks and asking that we get back together. I didn't trust my gut, and I let things progress too fast, including him meeting my kid, who is now attached. Should I get back together with him (with guidelines in place) or not?",relationship_advice,"Ex (23 M) called today, says he misses me (28 GF) &amp; wants to try again",2.0,2022-01-21
2022-01-21 01:47:34,13,False,13,"I just turned 18 in November and I’ve only been working at Publix since the beginning of October as a bagger and it’s had its ups and downs at first. Especially since I got hired right before all the holidays came around but I got over it bc it’s my first job and I need the experience and the little bit of money that came with it. However the next week after turning 18 it just got wayyy worse. They gave me 35 hours the week after, and I had basically turned into a bagger/janitor making $10.50 an hr. I was cleaning the bathroom, the garbage, staying to 11 to mop. I even got a blister on my ankle at one point. 

Needless to say I got my schedule fixed as soon as I saw that they were trying to work me that hard when I’m still in high school but I can’t help but think how I let myself work that long and that hard for that little amount of money. And I know there are people out here making less than that and work way harder and I sympathize with them but i hate this job. 

My last day of work is gonna be sometime in the first week of February. Idk exactly since I haven’t decided what day yet, but Ik I’m not giving them notice. The managers on the job have been so rude and on top of that, even after getting my schedule fixed they still bother with calling or asking if I can come in early or stay late. They’ve even started bothering me to start cashier training. And I honestly would have if I wasn’t quitting soon but since I am they can fuck off. 

One of the managers even shamed me. He basically said he’s disappointed and would never reject a position a manager offered him. And I’m not gonna go anywhere in my Publix career if I don’t do anything different. 

Idk if they think every teenager they have working for them at $10 an hr can be indoctrinated into wanting to work for them for the rest of their lives but it’s certainly not me. 

And everyone I talk to about this keeps telling me not to. Even the people in the Publix subreddit that sit there and write about how much they hate their job and wish they worked at a different store are saying not to. But idc at this point. Even if it’s incredibly reckless to people there are plenty of other stores out there that’ll hire me.

1) You have too many units under ou control and during a missions you, usually, have to move them all from one side of the map to another, which is an absolute hassle. Just imagine meticulously selecting each unit every turn and placing him into another square.

2) Units have very limited options during battle. Usually all they can to do is to move, use item and attack. That means that wither a cartain unit going to win, or he is going to loose, usually all in one turn.

One could think they only said that after they know why, but now i could see it too. They were same size, same coloured clothing, same acessory also. But. It. Was. Not. Them. Just very similar looking with clothes on. And to be fair, our cameras picture quality isnt very good.

&amp;#x200B;

I apologized and said that if that was the case there were no ban. But the shit has already hit the fan i could smell it flying towards me. They was, understandably, very upset and said how terrible customer service we had. I said they were, of course, welcome to shop at us and i thought they were someone else. But they was far too upset. They said they wont come here ever again. I believed it, and i also hoped it. I would feel terrible to have see them again after i banned them for nothing. 

&amp;#x200B;

After they left i texted my boss and explained the situation. First my boss said its ok, then boss told me the customer called and had been Furious. So my super nice boss got their piece of my delicious shit storm cake too. I felt, and i still feel, terrible. Im devastated. I hope world will end tomorrow so i dont have to face monday and my work place. Im sulking in my bed feeling like most terrible customer servicer and employee ever existed. 

&amp;#x200B;

2022-06-04 19:50:50,446,False,3657,"Sounds basic but I went swimming with a couple friends today and I saw a pretty muscular looking dude who imediately cought my eye. We were all swimming in circles in a whirlpool and I started to swimm behind him thinking about a way to start a conversation. At the end I just tapped his shoulder and said ""nice abs"". He was surprised that I could see them in the water and we started talking a little. He bought me some ice cream and now I have his number. Wish me luck yall.


Update: so the next day we wanted to go swimming again but it was raining and none of us had enough time for it so we went to get some ice cream and spent time at the park. We talked about all kinds of things like school/work and everything. After a while he told me that people have used him to make other jealous in the past so I'll try and show him that he's more than just his body. We get along extremely well but one thing that kinda nags me is how smart he is. (Not in a bad way). Whenever I want to tell him a fun fact  he already knows it. Whenever I mention politics he adds to the conversation instead of just being impressed. (It's unusual for me because I have always been the smart one in the group and now there's someone of equal caliber lmao but I dont mean ""nagging"" in a negative way dont get me wrong). 
After that I told my guy friends how much I'm crushing on him and they replied by saying things like ""he's only going to use you"" ""trust us, we are men ourselves and we know that a guy with a body like that only wants to get laid, dont come back crying to us when he inevitably fucks you over"" and the they kicked me outta the group chat💀💀💀. My female friends and a couple other guy friends are encouraging me tho so I'm pretty sure they are envious (i even hear abt one of them having a crush on me but idk if that's just a rumor or not). 
2 days ago we went to a restaurant and I noticed that he always pays for food. I always have my own money on me and I never expect anyone to pay for me but he actively wants to do it (ever guy I dated so far was like this and don't get me wrong I really don't mind but I always make it clear that they don't have to do that). After eating at the restaurant we got ice cream again and went to the same park and I swear I could talk to him for HOURS on end, which was exactly what we did. He even put his arm around me and let me lay on his lap and played with my hair so I'm pretty sure our feelings are mutual. When we were a the restaurant I mentioned how my friends were at a concert (The WavyBoy concert just in case anyone here knows him) and that I actually never went to one or even a club. His response to that was ""so that means you'll join me and my friends tomorrow?"". Yall. I. Never. Simped. This. Hard. Before. Not even for my first bf who had been my crush for years.

I (16m) work as a lifeguard at one of my local aquatic centers and have been for about 2 months now. It’s my first job and I’m new to the business of lifeguarding so I have a relatively narrow amount of knowledge on how everyone should conduct themselves. 
I have a coworker (17m) who I’ll call Ethan who is also a lifeguard but has been a lifeguard longer than me. Ethan is viewed as the “life of the party” by most of my other coworkers, who all seem to ignore anything he does/doesn’t do. What I mean by that is that Ethan displays a relative laziness when it comes to doing his job, some examples of this are as follows: He sits in the lifeguard chair or any other surfaces in his area even when he is supposed to be roaming (walking/standing), he doesn’t correct or reprimand patrons who endanger themselves, and he never contributes to cleaning after shifts and instead just leaves. 

Normally I wouldn’t mind if someone was slacking off at a job (not my circus not my monkeys sorta deal), but after witnessing multiple near drownings where a lifeguard who was guarding an adjacent space had to step in and the fact that he is endangering the health of some of the patrons made me feel obligated to mention something to my supervisor. It later became glaringly obvious that he found out I had told my supervisor about my concerns (which I voiced as a concern about consistency amongst the lifeguards) and now multiple people on the lifeguard staff seem to hate me.

Though, in the span of a year, I managed to change that and build a decent physique which you could call somewhat “attractive”. That gave me confidence to talk to girls and that bred this hunger I now have for a meaningful relationship with a member of the opposite sex. After countless cheap attempts at getting a girlfriend, I invited my friend (let’s call her C) to the gym with me since she wanted to know what my program was cause she wanted to see how I built nice glutes. I didn’t think she was attractive in any way and didn’t want a relationship with her other than friendship. But then, when we got to the gym and I held the door open for her, she hugged me and caught me by surprise, that instantly stole my heart and for the entire workout I was looking (not in a weird way tho) at her and laughing to myself cause she was just so great and amazing and I began seeing her as this cute, warm person. We then had dinner and stuff and all went well, as friends. The next week, we went out again to watch a movie and have dinner. I made a conscious effort to take photos because I knew this would be a rare occasion to be this happy. I had second doubts about her though but when I saw her, they immediately disappeared. She was the most beautiful girl I ever saw and I couldn’t focus on the movie cause I was just focusing and thinking about her while she’s sat next to me. After the movie, we sat and talked for like 2 hours and we both shared really private and intimate stuff with each other and it was amazing and refreshing to have someone care about me. I was over the moon then and all I could think about was kissing her. I didn’t though. And on the car ride home I asked her to be my girlfriend but she said she prefers to be friends as she doesn’t know by how she felt about me. i wish that’s  where it all ended, but it isn’t. I comforted her when she had bad thoughts and crying and I think I got her out of her shell. We then continued to chat even more and we hit it off even more and I truly felt we were a couple, we sent dirty pickup lines to each other, facetimed and sang songs together til 5am and played roblox a couple of times. That was the happiest period of my life by far. I told her how I went to therapy because of my stuttering and even updated her. On how my sessions went. One particular session, there was this girl who had to test me on my speech with strangers and I obviously told C about the session and she told me to manifest seeing that girl more often. I got confused and asked her if that was her official rejection of me and she said that she saw me as a brother. For two weeks straight I was devastated, didn’t eat or work out and barely studied. I cried in the shower multiple times but I still maintained contact with her and telling her how much she meant to me and how much I lived her and how miserable I felt after she rejected me. At school, I was visibly depressed and unmotivated and unhappy. One day, my friends noticed something wrong and I had to do all I could to muster up a smile but I just couldn’t take it anymore. I’ve broke down to my best friend multiple times, and I keep getting haunted by those beautiful memories of her and by her name which is beautiful man. we hugged each other everyday before class and the best part is that it was all just between us, barely anyone knew and when they suspect anything recently I have to relive all that pain again.

Hotels are terrible! At best, they are sterile, soulless, cookie cutter cramped rooms that feel like mouseholes where at best you hide from your vacation or business trip. Amenities like pools and hot tubs and workout rooms? Usually pretty skimpy or not working--and you have to share them with dozens of people.

AirBNB (if you research and get a good home)? Awesome. Having your own space truly in a comfortable home with couches, beds, showers, the whole feel of it is really awesome. Sometimes you'll get a unique spot with a big hot tub, gaming systems, libraries, a tiny house, etc.

2022-12-30 21:05:48,2,False,0,"My (32M) fiancee (31F) have been together for 7 years, engaged for about 4 months. My mom (70) is staying with us for the week of the holidays.


Some backstory first (Apologies if this gets long).


Now, like lots of other people my relationship with my mom is complicated. We love each other and have gone through a lot together (she was a single mom for a chunk of my life, we moved countries together, etc.) She's very stubborn, hard headed, and takes disagreements very personally. She's also very caring and kind, but all that accumulated means she can be very overbearing. I don't have enough time or space to paint the full picture of who she is, but to keep it simple, we love each other a lot, but fight a lot.


My fiancee's relationship with my mom is on the surface okay, but there have been conflicts. I think overall my mom likes my fiancee and has never voiced (to me) any displeasure or complaints about me being with her or getting engaged. She's always been (to me) supportive of our relationship and regularly tells me how wonderful my fiancee is.


Now, my fiancee has always been kind to my mom, but even from the beginning the relationship between them wasn't this wholesome open arms thing I had hoped for, it's always been a little cold. Our first year of dating, the first time my mom visited (I had already met my future in laws), we lived in a studio apartment together. I told my mom, and I should've checked with my fiancee, that she could stay with us. Once I told my fiancee, the response was bad, she didn't want her staying there because ""there's no space"". This felt cold to me, because my mom is then only person I have in my life outside of a couple friends. Had it been the other way around, I wouldn't have batted an eye at her mom staying with us. But fair enough, I fucked up not checking first. So we booked my mom a hotel room nearby, but there's no way my mom felt good about it, although she never said anything to me.


Over the next few years, things have been a little tumultuous. A couple times my mom has insulted my fiancee. Once, my mom asked fiancee how she wanted certain things organized in the kitchen, fiancee explained how and added that that's how her grandma taught her, so she's been doing it every since. According to fiancee, my mom then did it differently. Fiancee's parents are from another country (let's say Colombia), but she was born here. My mom was on the phone with someone who was asking about my fiancee, my mom said some nice things, described her accurately, but added ""she's kind of a ""fake"" Colombian, her parents are from there"". Now, my mom's english is very good, but she sometimes says things that aren't quite normal in terms of grammar and whatnot. In my opinion, this was a case of that issue, she put her foot in her mouth. Another time I remember my mom ""correcting"" my fiancee when fiancee was explaining something about Colombia. Fiancee is very sensitive about her heritage, and this obviously didn't sit well. wether my mom was correct or not about the info itself is besides the point. 


So when Fiancee is a little ""cold"", some of it is obviously from these things that have bothered her in the past, more of it is no doubt due to my own fights with my mom (it no doubt affects your view of MiL if your SO is constantly fighting with her). But I also don't know how much of it is dislike of who my mom is, her personality, etc. 

Most of my fights with my mom are over really stupid things, which is really frustrating. For example, two days ago we're all watching a movie. Paul Dano shows up, and my mom says ""this actor always plays a bad guy"", I answer ""not always, but yeah a lot of the time"", she replies ""I've only seen him do these roles, I've only seen him in like two movies."" Now, she's seen him in many movies, because I've watched those movies with her, including Swiss Army Man where Dano doesn't play a bad guy/creep. So I tell her ""you've seen him in lots of movies, even as a good guy"". She gets mad and starts telling me ""No I haven't. How would you know what I've watched?"" I mention specific movies, and she gets angrier and angrier, telling me that I'm making things up etc, that I'm always implying that she's stupid, etc, essentially acting like I was gaslighting her when it was really the other way around. It was a really stupid fight for no reason, it should've ended with her just saying ""ai don't remember"" or whatever. We have arguments like that all the time. From my point is view, the root cause is a constant miscommunication of intent. When she wants to advise me, it comes across as her criticizing. When I want to say my opinion or whatever and they differ, she takes it as an attack or as if I'm telling her she's wrong. This happens over and over.


So, understandably, regardless of wether my mom is generally nice to my fiancee, my fiancee ends up witnessing this stuff and it no doubt affects her perception of my mom. Any time that they have some sort of, what I perceive as miscommunication, I end up making excuses for both of them. ""I don't think my mom meant it that way, but you're right that it was hurtful"" or ""my fiancee just needs space, she's introverted and it's not personal"" or whatever. 

So cut to the problem at hand. Last night fiancee comes home from work, says hello, and goes upstairs to change. She's taking a minute, so I go up to say hi again and open the door to catch her on the phone with her mom. They're discussing what seems to be serious family stuff, so I leave and close the door again. About an hour goes by and I need to grab something from the room, so I go up and, not wanting to barge in during a bad moment, put my ear to the door to see if it's a good moment. 

To my surprise, I overhear my fiancee talking to her mom about my mom. I hear these snippets: ""She's getting even more controlling..."" ""they started fighting again, over nothing, but they're sitting across from each other so I don't wanna sit in the middle, so I ate my breakfast in the kitchen and just left..."" ""Every time I bring up wedding stuff it's like she doesn't want to hear it. When we called her about the proposal, she wasn't excited, she basically just said 'about time's and smiled, but that's it..."" There were other things said, but I wasn't gonna stay there eaves dropping .

So two things happened upon hearing this. First, once again it seemed to me like something was being misinterpreted. When we called my mom about the engagement, she was happy. I know she was happy, because I've known my mom my whole life. She was happy and excited, but she also wasn't surprised because I'd been showing her the ring and talking to her about it. But she was happy. Again, never has she been unsupportive of my relationship. One thing she doesn't meddle in much is my relationships, however in contrast to this relationship, she disapproved of my ex, and while she didn't meddle, it's night and day.

The other thing that happened was that I felt betrayed. I felt like it's none of her parents business what my relationship with my mom is like, and any fights we have are private. It felt to me like a huge breach of trust to overhear my fiancee not only telling her mom about our fights, but almost putting her own spin on things ""she wasn't happy about the proposal"", ""I think she doesn't like..."" adding intentions to my mom's actions that I don't feel are accurate. It feels horrible to know that she's been saying things to her parents all this time, painting a bad picture of my mom and my relationship with her. Some of her issues are fair, but it seems like she then assumes the worst of my mom even when that intention isn't there.

One of the fights my mom and I had last year, my mom commented that my fiancee despised her. I mad excuses, convinced she was wrong. Now, I'm wondering if she was right.

I'm tired of making excuses for both of them, and after hearing my fiancee gossiping, I'm starting to not know who to trust, who to believe. I don't know if I'm right that it's mostly miscommunication, idk if I'm wrong and my mom has intentionally hurt my fiancee despite me seeing no disapproval, Idk if my fiancee actually despises my mom,  Idk of she spreading exaggerations about my mom and my relationship with her, idk of she should she even be spreading info about my mom and I at all. I'm incredibly hurt having overheard her. I feel lost, betrayed, unknowing who to trust, believe, unknowing of who is telling me the truth, who's lyring, etc. It really put me in a bad place.

Sorry if this is long, It's hard to post such complicated dynamics, and the last thing I want is people offering advice who also are missing context, misinterpreting, etc.

How should I approach these issues in the future? I told my fiancee what I heard and that I felt very hurt, and her response was to say ""I don't know what you think you heard"" and tell me that I say things about her parents too. We haven't been able to discuss further because my mom is still here. I'm unsure of how to try and mend these relationships, and I'm unsure of how to avoid misunderstandings (if that's what's going on).

TLDR: Caught my fiancee talking about my mom and my relationship with her being my back to MiL, some of which was factual and some which were fiancee's own interpretations of my mom's actions and intentions. I feel very hurt by the lack of privacy, and feel she broke my trust by spreading personal things.

* Interracial relationship, get grief on all sides because of this, including apparently in backchannel media and MSM but only through metaphor.  Constant ridiculous claim that I am being ""elevated"".  Constantly scapegoated for other people's behavior and/or insecurities.  Suddenly developed a terminal illness out of the blue.
* Mixed white guy with all black mentors and friends growing up, friends thought it was weird (understatement).  I know most people just say white, but even before the interracial stuff my ""not quite a member of our family"" status caused me issues.
* My entire life all my work was stolen by people less capable, resourceful, possibly less educated, including my own father who is constantly hacking me to make sure I don't get any traction in life.  I had dates I told him and his new wife about complain to me that they were being contacted and the situation was too weird for them.  He used me as a tax shelter, ruined my credit, and to this day is up on my networks along with like 2 other groups at least.  People hate exceptions and naturally talented people., and interracial.  He also badmouthed me in my home city to another set of defense contractors and half the tech industry in my home city.
* I worked for a company that was trying to train everyone on Security + before they could do anything else.  Obviously a defense contractor.  The company in question is shady as hell, they constantly threatened and intimidated employees without ever giving them direct orders or any kind of actual leadership.  When they found out I had invented something back in grad school (also stolen because I was just a dumb white local at a time when only people from other countries attended engineering grad school), they used vague death threats against me and family and advanced tech to force me to turn over my patent rights.  Having lied about a large cash bonus for signed over patents, they reduced the payout by 1/20th and then claimed it was never my invention to begin with.
* I also invented many other things and they just steal any tech or ideas from employees and pretend like the inventor never existed.  Yes I know what run-on sentences are and how US IP law works.  Anything I invent at work is theirs, but you would think they could at least give you some credit.  They hate millennials and younger and did not employ them until they realized their people were mass retiring.  They had no idea how to handle millennials.  As mad as I am at them, everyone does that to me.  Slap a couple lines of code on a fully formed blueprint and call it theirs.  That, or steal a script off your computer and pretend it is theirs or etc etc.  I never liked cybersecurity, consider it extremely childish and usually just left myself wide open.  It is a MAD (mutually assured destruction) game also.  Imagine using 40 digit passcodes and them still not working, and you can't write it down because someone might snap it or get access to it.
* I had some kind of neural atypical issue when I was younger (if not multiple) and managed to grow out of it.  I have autistic friends and family, and I used to run groups for introverted intellectuals.  I also participated in an autism group in my home city.  I do not appreciate FOX scapegoating like that.
* I also use alternative methods to make money just to survive.  It mostly has to do with filling the gaps in between contracts.  It's been a while since I worked hospitality, food service or retail, but I am considering it.  I have an extreme service mentality when I work those jobs.",antiwork,"Response to Interview, an AMA about how the defense sector and phony cancel culture screwed up my entire life.",0.0,2022-01-26

2022-01-27 18:47:12,8,False,7,"A confession up front: I haven't watched the Fox News interview so many people are talking about, but I'm going to talk about it here. My reason for not watching is that I already know how it's going to go. I've seen this script with Black Lives Matter, watched the attacks on Occupy Wall Street, and saw them try to define the narrative for Extinction Rebellion.

I see a lot of anger here towards the moderator who talked to Fox News, but suggest that anger would be better focused on Fox News itself. In any fight between a functionally powerless volunteer with no real leadership role and a slickly-produced multi-million dollar propaganda factory, it's probably not the volunteer calling the shots.

This is what the monied ruling class and its media lapdogs do. They find a movement they don't like, come up with a strategy to discredit it, and pour money into that strategy. They hire consultants to examine or infiltrate that movement with an eye towards who they can use to craft a counter-narrative then selectively interview their curated subjects with a script that has been honed through dozens of operations around the world meant to quash popular revolt against consumerism and authoritarianism.

If this sounds paranoid to you, keep in mind that American companies spend US$340 million a year scaring their employees out of unionizing. Do you really think they're not spending money to discredit 1.7 million people who categorically reject their pro-boss, anti-union bullshit?

This is what it means to be part of a movement that could cost rich people money. We're going to be attacked and it's not just going to be by Russian trolls and alt-right forward scouts. It's going to be by professional shit-stirrers and slick media operations like Fox News.

Take some heart in this: We wouldn't be under attack if they weren't scared of us. Antiwork and the great resignation are making real changes in the world. Bosses already can't take for granted that they can always replace the workers they treat like shit. They can't bully us into playing by their rules like they used to.

Otherwise, any scripts or strategies I might follow.

Some background, I (25+ F) have been with SO (25+ M) for 5 years and his family is very nice and welcoming. I've been on holidays with them and grandparents before. Last year I quit my job due to shady working conditions and I didn't withhold my decision (I usually would but I was being overly optimistic) including with his family. Unfortunately the ordeal has impacted my confidence and although I'm privileged to afford it, I've taken a longer beat in becoming reemployed than anticipated.

His grandparents are very industrious people, they love talking about everybody's work, and they are known for pressing the issue with their own family. Ever since, they ask about my employment situation and I haven't had anything worthwhile to say. I'm not especially close with them or anybody else. I let them know I'd share when I had good news which they seemed to understand, but on a subsequent occasion they pressed the issue anyway ETA and wouldn't/couldn't take a hint. I'm not sure how to respond since they're not my own family, we're adults so it makes sense that they would talk to me directly about it, I'm not 100% confident that they're ""altogether,"" I appreciate that people are probably concerned on behalf of SO, and otherwise I find them genuinely decent. Even when I'm not present they still ask my SO about my status.

So these grandparents have put a milestone party on the calendar and I'm wondering how offensive it may be if I beg off. I've missed a few events in the past and it's probably apparent that I'd begged off. I don't have a role in the party, but I might be regarded similar to family.

The church is about a 45 minute drive from where I live. The friend who invited me just kind of assumed I’d be giving her a ride, and even though she didn’t really ask, I said ok because she lives on my route home and she was nice enough to invite me. 

As the event was wrapping up, my friend asked if I could give her other friend, Sally, a ride home as well. I said I can’t because I only have my provisional license and one of my restrictions is I can only have one passenger (with a few exceptions like if I have a supervisor in the car or if they’re immediate family). My friend went to go tell Sally that I couldn’t drive her and everyone seemed really upset. 

The ride home was awkward. My friend kept telling me I need to get my full license because now Sally has to take transit home and it’s two hours by bus and it’s going to be really late. I said that I know that, and I feel bad, but legally I can’t have more than one passenger. My friend said I should have just taken Sally, as it’s not a big deal and people overload their cars all the time. I said maybe if it was a 10-15 minute drive I would have reconsidered but it’s a 45 minute drive and I don’t know Sally. I’m not willing to risk getting pulled over, ticketed and losing my license for someone I don’t know (another restriction is I have to have this neon green reflective N on the back of my car to let police know I’m a new driver, so if a police officer saw me with my N on the back and multiple passengers I would for sure get pulled over).

He’s trying to better himself which is costing a lot but all I can focus on is the money and I don’t know how to change. He deserves better than that. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 2.5 years. We moved in together last summer. I already know I’m not most peoples’ cup of tea because I have a lot of issues from childhood that aren’t the responsibility of my partners but they still affect my relationships. I’m in therapy for that but it’s a slow process. My current boyfriend handles it all so well. He’s incredibly patient, doesn’t mind that I’m not huge on affection, understands my limits, and still looks at me/treats me like I’m the best thing the world has to offer. I already felt like he deserved way more than I give him. 

Now, I just feel plain horrible because I can’t stop picking fights about money. He is not good with his money but his parents are even worse so I know he didn’t get the chance to learn how to manage his money well like I did. Why can I not be patient with him? In my mind, I’ve tried and tried for months and nothing is working. He’s still blowing budgets and recklessly spending. That’s what stops me from feeling sympathetic because he swears he’s trying to learn and then doesn’t. But it took me longer than that to learn growing up so why am I so hard on him?

Meat is expensive right now and he wants lots of chicken every week at the store because he wants second meals on top of what we plan for dinners. 

He already ate enough for two people and our finances are limited. We really can’t afford to be feeding a “third” person. But he’s just trying to better himself. Am I a massive asshole for telling him we can’t buy all this extra food? I feel like one. Is money really more important than his wellbeing? Am I looking at it all wrong? I don’t know.

But I've had an account for years, so how does me watching this  movie, as an already existing subscriber, figure into the company making  any money back on the budget? They cannot possibly expect to attract  enough NEW subscribers to make back the $75 million, so how do they  warrant spending that kind of money?

Further,  how does a completely free streaming service expect to make any money  on any original programming?

so here is the problem Steve said that he is British and is currently studying tech in the UK as his major , that was all cool and all , but the thing is Steve didn’t sound British at all I got somewhat suspicious of him although I did nothing about it and stayed silent . about a month later Steve told me to add his gf Emmy on discord as she is a new player  and was hoping to join us sometimes.

fast forward to 2 days ago I hopped on discord and for the first time I saw Emmy online we talked a bit and I invited her to play (it was just the 2 of us at that time) , we had fun and then chatted a little after ,briefly I asked her about the UK  and she denied the fact that either her or Steve lives there and that they’re both from Germany , honestly I didn’t know why Steve would lie but I was mad about it , I’m a person who hates liars from the bottom of my heart.

2022-05-25 15:58:10,13,False,0,"Hello everyone, this is a bit of a long and drawn out situation involving me T (F31), my spouse R (MtF 30) and our coworker/friend S (NB 25). 

Obligatory I'm on mobile comment, so I apologize for any formatting errors. Also, fair warning that this is long. 

Okay, so first things first, coworker is what describes things best but in actuality we're all PhD students in a small program with at least a few years left where we're stuck with each other. My spouse is a year ahead of me and S who just started the program last year. It is at least a four year program. In our program we're encouraged to work together and my spouse and NB person share an advisor who is usually especially pushy about their advisees working together. 

So that's some of the background information. S and I started the program last fall and were friendly pretty much right away, so I invited them to hang out with the second years my spouse and I were friends with. Things seemed pretty smooth that whole semester. We all hung out, got food during class breaks, watched movies, went to a haunted house etc. 

Things were smooth until Thanksgiving when S and I got into what I consider to be a disagreement over Thanksgiving etiquette, I got a little heated (nothing bad, just a strongly worded message of why I believed them to be wrong). I immediately apologized and backed off. This all was maybe a five minute text conversation. They said nothing to me but then in our Friendsgiving group chat they messaged that they would no longer be coming to the party and abruptly left the chat. They then proceeded to ignore me for the rest of the semester (about 3 weeks) and didn't speak to me at all for about another month or so until the spring semester started. They were, however, in constant communication with my spouse (note: my spouse and I were in an open relationship at that point and my spouse had voiced interest in S to them) and hanging out with them until all hours of the night. Now, I do blame my spouse for this, because they had made plans with me and blew me off to spend time with S, and even left me alone when I was really sick to go hang out with S. But that's another issue. 

Once spring semester started, S and I had a chat about boundaries and they expressed interest in still being friends. I explained how I can get passionate about certain topics (our disagreement was on workers rights) but that I don't hold their opinions against them and I'm not trying to be aggressive at all and I again apologized for my part in the disagreement. They accepted my apology and moved on, but they were definitely chilly toward me and constantly made what felt to me like passive aggressive comments aimed at me and my insecurities (we had played a party game that talked about insecurities and friendship at one of our hangouts). I tried to ignore it but it seemed to be getting more and more pointed at me, with them even making comments in class that were thinly veiled insults. I started getting uneasy around them and couldn't quite put my finger on why. 

Around the end of March our entire friend group decided to go to a themed bar night. Most of us girls got together early to swap clothes around and help each other with makeup, and the pre-game a bit. We spent about three hours getting ready. S rolls in several hours late (which is the usual for them) and then sits quietly in a corner getting ready on their own, not engaging with anyone else. Now, I'll admit, I'm an introvert and I was definitely more into the getting ready with my friends aspect than the party itself. I took an edible before we left though (legal in our state) and went to the bar with everyone. During the night I ended up mainly watching everyone's coats and helping take pictures of the party, something I'm much more comfortable with than dancing. At one point though, S came up and tried to get me to dance. I tried to decline because I was feeling pretty high and tense in the unfamiliar setting but they grabbed me and physically pulled me to the center of the dance floor, knowing I'm pretty touch adverse unless I initiate it or it's my spouse. I stayed out there for a few minutes before retreating away. The worst part is they research consent and advocate strongly for enthusiastic consent but then walked all over my already communicated boundaries. Anyway...

Apparently they took that as a personal slight because a few friends have come up to me and told me recently that S told them I was a party pooper, who refuses to engage at parties and just sulks? And they used the night at the bar as an example. Luckily my friends stood up for me. 

A couple of weeks after the bar night I was scrolling through social media and noticed that they had unfriended me on everything, which was surprising to me as we had all just been hanging out. But again, I had had this feeling that something was wrong and had talked to my spouse about it and they had said I was probably just being insecure and paranoid as S was one of the nicest people they knew. I screenshot their profiles with the ""add friend"" visible and sent it to my spouse with a note saying ""guess I'm not completely crazy"" or something like that. I didn't realize my spouse was hanging out with S and that S would look over their shoulder at their phone and blow up at them about me. 

Long story short, right after our next class period they pulled me aside and very aggressively (as in they were very much so in my space and I almost thought they were going to slap me or something) told me they did not want to be friends with me, they would not talk to me, did not want me talking to them, did not want me engaging with them in social settings, and they did not want me ""monitoring them"" through social media. I was a bit taken aback by this sudden change but just nodded and left. If that's the boundaries they wanted I could respect that, even if I was a little hurt. 

The remainder of the semester I did as they asked, I didn't talk with them and tried to avoid them as much as possible, which was hard as they had merged into my only friend group. But I focused on my classes and tried to focus on my relationship with my spouse, which for the first time in 10 years seemed to be really struggling. They were constantly out hanging with S and spending money that we didn't have on these hangouts. We decided we were getting separate apartments once our lease ended at the end of May and started packing up our lives to separate. Again, that's a separate issue for the most part. You can read about that in my post history if you want. 

More pertinent though, I've had a few friends come forward and let me know that in the last few weeks of class S started saying these awful things to other grad students about me, making comments like ""isn't it nice that T isn't here sulking around and being a downer?"" Which thankfully my friends shot down right away. They also tried to call me abusive toward my spouse, based on part of an interaction they saw where my spouse had just gotten out of the doctors office and was drugged up pretty good and I was trying to get them home before they got sick (the meds the doctor gave them always makes them sick and we have a half hour car ride home). They thought me trying to wrangle my drugged up spouse into the car was abusive because my spouse was saying things like ""but I want to stay"" and ""let me just do X or Y first"" (things they could do at home when not drugged up). My spouse even thanked me for getting them home and apologized for acting like a drunk teenager lol. 

Oh, and they also spread rumors around about my spouse and my relationship based on private information my spouse had shared with them. One of our other friends came forward with the things she had been told by S and was asking if any of it was true, which parts of it were (like my spouse and I separating) but the reasonings had all been twisted to put me in particular in a very negative light which was incredibly shocking for both my spouse and I. 

My spouse can be a very sweet and sometimes naive person, and now that a lot of this is coming to light and S has been gone visiting their family for a couple of weeks they are realizing that S has been really pushing them to leave me, which is the exact opposite of what they have wanted.

There's more that's coming out still and I've been trying to pin down exactly what they've said to my friends as I've been very careful not to talk to anyone about them as I didn't want to jeopardize their career, but now I'm definitely thinking I was too nice. This is not the kind of situation I expected encountering in my 30s, in a graduate level program. 

So yeah...tl;dr fellow grad student has been trying to, I don't even know, undermine all of my friendships and my marriage? It's partially worked with my spouse and I separating but we got apartments in the same complex and are going to try to work through this. 

I need any advice that you all can give though on how to approach this whole situation. From finding out exactly what happened, dealing with my spouse and their part in it, and how to manage three more years with this person in the same office and program.

So, after countless times hearing from my roommates that I should clean the kitchen I decided to do it, it had some very bad spots with old grease and for some reason I decided to use bleach and kerosene together, since they both are good at removing stuff.

I know I had to deal with similar unnecessary behaviour in the past myself, so as I walked past that encounter, I had enough in my head and turned back around...

I walked up to the store assistant who was in the process of shoo-ing these people away, and loudly (and admittedly pretty obnoxiously) exclaimed ""ARE YOU OPEN? OH, YOU'RE NOT? NO WORRIES! YOU'RE CLOSED, YOU'RE CLOSED. I'LL COME BACK TO TOMORROW, NO PROBLEM!"" as I stared down this couple, flailing my arms in a 'f\*\*\*-off-motion' ...I think they promptly got the idea.

2022-06-21 08:22:08,13,False,2,"To clarify, I don’t necessarily think that I’m right, but this is how I feel

We’ve been dating for two months, but it really seems like it’s been so much longer because of how much we’ve been able to do together and how strongly I’ve grown to feel about her. It feels like I’ve found someone that I can really get along with and enjoy my time with, as we’re very compatible in almost every way. The only thing that I can’t get over is her body count, which is putting a strain on our relationship. 

To preface, it isn’t even that high and her sexual history doesn’t raise any red flags (cheating, undisclosed STDs/STIs, etc). Regardless, the fact that I’ve only slept with one other person (who I was dating) while she’s slept with 5 others (2 boyfriends, 3 one-offs) really eats me up when I think about it. I think there could be a few different causes for my concern: I feel like she doesn’t care about us/this isn’t as special to her as it is to me, FOMO, and I feel like I can’t relate to her and her social lifestyle. 

I’ll briefly address each concern: firstly, she’s told me that I’m the best she’s ever had both in regards to sex and as a boyfriend, and while I mostly believe her, I feel like there’s a very big difference between 2 and 6 as far as novelty is concerned; secondly, and this one might be particularly silly, but I think my fear of missing out is causing me anxiety over not having been there for her first experiences outside of basic intercourse. This sort of thing was a problem in my last relationship too, although I don’t know how to pinpoint the cause; thirdly, the idea I have of her, myself, and the social dynamics of sexual acts contradict. I understand her to be a certain way that I find relatable, but my understanding of people who get around a lot isn’t the kind of person I easily relate to on such an intimate level. My lack of experience makes this seemingly high number daunting and undesirable. Jointly, I haven’t really had the opportunity to have a FWB, so the unfamiliarity makes me uncomfortable. Maybe I’d be no different from her if I had the chance, and maybe I wouldn’t, but I just don’t know.

I don’t like judging her for something as superficial as this, but it’s been really hard to shake and I’d like some advice on handling my emotions around it. I’d like to talk more thoroughly about this with her, but I don’t know if that would be appropriate because she doesn’t like talking about it a lot.

Thanks for any helpful advice


TL;DR I really like my girlfriend, but her body count bothers me. She’s slept with 5 other people and I’ve slept with 2, and that makes it feel like she has moved past the level of familiarity with sex that I’m at, hard to relate to, and hard to understand.

We’ve been dating like 12 years. We’re going through it. He recently quit a toxic job and is working on himself. We are both in therapy. I’ve been working on myself too. 
He isn’t romantic. A big part was the toxic job he was at for the past 5 years. But like no dates,no surprises, very little passion, very minimal sex life. 
He quit about 3 months ago. 

My birthday was last week (Thursday. Because of poor planning on his new manager (and his part) he got scheduled to work thurs-Sun. Nbd. Plans change.
Here’s the problem. He did NOTHING on the day of my birthday. He had an apology about attempting to order a cake but it not working (which he had found out about the day before). Ok no cake w/e but I’m obviously a bit sad. Then we just watch tv till he goes to work. My parent come to take my out to dinner, it goes bad cause my parents kinda suck and I come home from dinner to him home from work watching tv on the couch. He promises something is coming. 

Sunday comes and I wake up and he has a banner and some steamers (that he told me he bought that morning) Says I bought you cake mix. And I’m gonna make breakfast but it would be best if I kinda helped cause I’m a better cook. He got me some nice gifts. I was really thankful. 

But this week we’re arguing and he brings up how he did soooo much for my birthday and I was like dude there was no cake and not even a card. So idk. And he tries to blame me for the lack of cake-saying how I told him to not spend money (mind you I was talking about the $50+ cake and I’ve told him MULTIPLE times that if it’s under $15 he can buy it to surprise me(because we are tight on money this is the rule we both do- anything $15+ we discuss)

I just feel like an after thought. I feel like after so long of not having romance or whatever I just wanted something that was like idk he was more excited about. Like spend a couple days planning. I just want him to think about me and put me first (obviously not all the time but a reasonable amount). 

So the question of the day. Am I asking too much? To be fair he has a lot to work on. He has to become like a functioning human again. But he just keeps telling me to wait and things will get better. He told me to wait till my birthday and he’ll prove it. And I feel like he just proved I’m always going to be an after thought and I’m worried.

2022-08-31 03:11:42,6,False,2,"Our teenage daughter has been in her “coming of age” stage this summer, and we have had some great conversations about clothing choices, pride in herself and what she chooses to show off (especially on Instagram), etc. It’s all been very body-positive and I want her to own her sexuality and choices as she matures. 

As part of this, my husband and I (we are both 37) have decided that home will be her safe space in that regard. She can wear whatever she wants here, be whoever she is, and we won’t say a word. Its worked out great. I catch her preening in the mirror at her looks, and my husband and I notice that she is essentially “posing” to see what looks nice. Im sure it’s stuff she’s learning on instagram - hip jutting out, fixing her pony tail just so, etc. 

I think this is all a normal part of growing up, but recently a particular “pose” she favors while watching tv has made my husband slightly uncomfortable, as it’s on the sexy/suggestive side. He is her stepfather, so he may be particularly sensitive to it. (I don’t think she intends it this way, it’s just part of her getting used to her body and how she presents it.)

2022-08-31 03:12:12,5,False,2,"Apologies for the long post, trying to get thos off my chest.

My wife (H) 32 and I (35) got married in 2011. I was an international student when we met. And she is from the US. I waited until I got a job to marry her, just to avoid gossip. However, the next year, I lost my job because of my immigration status. During that time I was depressed and sad. And kept my feelings to myself. During this time, H cheated on me with my close friend. And I found out when she was messaging him online right next to me in our bed. When I confronted her, she fled and went to our other mutual friend's (M) place and slept with him ( which I later found out). The next day she said she was sorry and threatened to k*** herself. So we worked through that. Stupid me, holding on to old values, always thought Divorce was never an option, once you are married. And things did start to feel better. Eventually in 2015 we moved across the state for my job. We had 2 kids. And then, last summer I noticed a big change in her appearance and attitude. She was very secretive. As I was having this conversation,  I saw an email from a name I recognized on her phone. She has been texting M for a while and has been deleting the texts. When I asked her, she denied texting M first. Then she said she doesn't remember what she texted him. Then she finally gave me this. 'I was just asking him how he wasn't to get a closure. When I tried to find out what was deleted, she flipped the script on me and said I am invading her privacy by trying to get the message back.

Since then our relationship has been the worst. She's had depression and suicidal tendencies for as long as I can remember. So bringing up any sensitive subject with her was always my worst nightmare. This January, when I brought up separation/divorce, she got drunk and rammed her car into a pole. She went to rehab for 2 months and got out. Was doing better for 6 months. 

So I thought this is the time to bring this up again. So this Saturday, I asked her what she was thinking. She said 'I don't know '. So I replied, I want to file for divorce. After a short pause, she replied 'okay'. I was relieved.

Sunday afternoon, when I got back home from my errands, she was drinking, and had dropped the kids off at my sister's. She kept the insults coming. And I did my best to not engage with her verbally. Eventually I was in a good off with her for almost 6 hours, trying to keep her from harming herself with a knife and prescription drugs. I gave up and went to my bedroom. Within a few mins she was begging me choking me with an arm lock. I remained calm and asked her to let go. She didn't. This went on for about 5 mins. Eventually I called 911. Between the time it took me calling 911 and them showing up, she injected herself with copious amounts of prescription drugs (She is a nurse) and had a knife to her throat. And when they finally got home they arrested her for DV. And took her to ER first before arresting her. 

I have filed for protective order and she will get out tomorrow for will not be able to come home, or see the kids.

Now I am worried that the min she gets out she is gonna attempt again, either in rage or sadness/depression. I understand she is an adult and her actions are her own. But I can't imagine our kids not having a mother in their lives, even if it is from a distance.

Please help me make the right decision here. I am lost. And not sure what to tell the kids now, or when the inevitable happened. How do we avoid it? How can I help keep her alive?",relationship_advice,"I can't figure out what my current, soon to be ex-wife wants. And I am not sure what to do now.",3.5,2022-08-31
2022-09-13 01:38:06,253,False,2747,"Throwaway Account because people in my life know my main.

I (23f) am my parents only child together but my dad (46m) has another daughter ""Jane"" (15f) with the woman who he cheated on my mom (47f) with. I don't know all the details because I was pretty young when it all happened and my parents both agreed that I didn't need to know the details, but from what I could gather over the years is that dad had a brief fling and ended it when he realized that she wanted more while he just wanted fun.

Despite it already being over my mom found out and kicked my dad out of our home the same day. My dad was very remorseful and spent a whole year, from what I can describe as Love Bombing my mom until she agreed to give him another chance. Everything was going on well and there seemed to be a chance for true reconciliation until my dad was hit with a paternity law suit. His fling had gotten pregnant with Jane and after the DNA test proved that he was the father my mom was done. Apparently my mom was completely prepared to live the rest of her life as if my dad's cheating had never happened in order to still be with him but with the existence of a child from that act of betrayal there would be no way to overlook it.

For years my mom remained single and I guess my dad took that as a sign that she was still in love with him, but was completely shocked when he saw her marriage announcement on social media back in August. For the past three years my mom was dating a former work colleague ""Ian"" (53m) and they had decided to elope and honeymooned in Hawaii. I knew about the relationship after Ian and my mom were 4 months in and I gave it my blessing and even went with them on the trip.

My dad was heartbroken and furious at me for ""betraying"" him by not telling him that mom was seeing someone else but later apologized. I forgave him because I know he still secretly loved my mom but I started to get concerned after he started drinking more. More than once I've had to pick him up from a bar and sneak him back into the house while Jane was sleeping but this time he passed out in the garage and Jane walked in on him.

When he woke up he was sobbing while drunk and moaning about how miserable his life was without my mom. That cheating on her was the biggest mistake of his life and how he wishes it never happened. Jane was there when he said this and later confided in me how hurt that made her because if he hadn't of cheated then she wouldn't exist and so Jane believes that he wishes she didn't exist. I told her that I'm sorry she felt that way and while I'm not the best person to speak to about this I can talk to dad about getting her a therapist. Jane then teared up and said that I clearly hate her too and has been crying to our grandmother about this. Grandma thinks I was a total TA about the situation and should've comforted my sister more. AITA?

ETA: Just to be clear on the following

1. Jane's mom dropped her off at our dad's place when she was 13 for the usual weekend visit and just never came back. My dad now has legal custody of Jane and her mom has only seen Jane about four times ever since.
2. I have my own place and don't live with either parent.
3. All the information I have ever gathered on the situation was overhearing conversations when people thought I wasn't around.
4. My dad doesn't trust Uber/Lyft and thinks that one of the drivers will come back to rob him later.
5. I don't hate Jane but we're not besties either and as a 23 year old I'm not trying to constantly hang out with a high schooler, but if ever there was an emergency of course I'd be there for her.
6. Yes, I'm still angry at my dad for what he did but less so as an adult. I don't think we'll ever get to a point where I truly and completely forgive him.
7. I don't view my dad as an alcoholic because this has only been going on for a month and he's still able to be a productive person Monday-Thursday.
8. Literally right after I put my dad to bed Jane confided in me about this. Like right after I crossed out of the door frame.",AmItheAsshole,AITA For Not Comforting My Sister After Our Dad Made A Heartbreaking Confession While Drunk?,1500.0,2022-09-13

I had a good friend group in high school with the “weirdos” but none of us talk anymore. I had friends on an off in college but it always seemed so easy for them to just shut off that friendship. They’d get boyfriends or new friends and would stop talking to me. Even if we had plans made. I feel like a placeholder friend. That person you hang out with when you just need something to do but don’t know if you want to hang out again later. It feels horrible. 

I wish people knew how many ideas and plans I have for if I could ever get a friend group. I wish people knew how badly I want a friend group. I’d do anything for a friend. They needed someone to go to the emergency room at midnight just to hold their hand? I’m your girl. They need help moving cross country? Let’s do this. I’d do anything. And yet I feel like I’ll never be able to prove it. I 

had a friend that I dropped everything for the moment her engagement ended. I helped her move back home, I was there for every date night she had until she found her fiancé. I didn’t even know the wedding was coming up. I was never invited. I talk to her fiancé daily and to her multiple times a week. I wasn’t even invited. I had a friend in college that I helped move, saw her every day, talked to her everyday, went on cross country trips with her and her fiancé. I wasn’t even invited to their wedding. I wasn’t even told. Why? Did I do something? Did I say something?

I was with a guy for 2.5 years. I loved him. We were looking for houses. I had been there through multiple severe depressive episodes. I told him every day how incredible he was and how much he was loved. We were planning our lives together. Then he just pretends I don’t exist. He stops talking to me. What did I do? Then the next guy was fun. We weren’t anything serious but I was fine with that. We set boundaries and communicated well. One day he admits he got jealous of me hanging out with a friend and wanted to see me, then we were planning dinner together, by the end of the week he was telling me that he wasn’t interested anymore and wanted to end it. Okay? That’s cool. I thought I had finally made a friend. We had tons in common. I even helped her rescue a dog so we could do doggy play dates.

2022-09-16 22:03:19,5,False,1,"So her and I meet at work early in the summer, we hang out a few times and texted almost every day. Recently we were texting less and less and I became afraid I was loosing our relationship. I don't think that we were actually, but I'll get to that.

I've actually pushed another friend(23m) away this same way, we've since made up. Now I've realized that I can't be irrationally afraid of loosing a relationship because that makes it worse, so I'm going to work on that, and actually have improved a little.

Anyway, she recently moved back to school, and I go to school close to home. So that was a part of my fear. I did develop some feelings for her, that didn't help either. Even earlier this summer she said that I liked her too much and I just shrugged it off. I shouldn't have, we should have talked about it. 

I ended up trying to keep texting going every day as that's what I liked and got used to. So she last text me last Thursday, and then I texted her Saturday morning and then again Sunday night. She never answered which is cool she needed space and is at school. She probably should've said something again, but it didn't work before so I get that. Or maybe I'm in denial lol. 

So then yesterday (Thursday) I uploaded a song that she sent to my snapchat story just so she could see it, which is definitely wrong and I know that, but people do bad things when they're afraid. She then removed me from snapchat and I have no idea if she blocked my phone number. 

After giving it some thought I decided that I needed to better myself, work on how I view friendships they should be able to come and go and you should be able to not talk to a friend for a period of time. I also want to send her a text and tell her I'm sorry and how I'm working on myself and that I would like to be freinds when I'm done, or text her once I've improved. And be friends from there. 

I don't know what a good time frame to text would be, a couple weeks, months, or just when I feel I'm better. I don't even know if I could same the friendship, but I'd like to. I'm also afraid that she won't come back to work next summer because of it and then I'd feel bad for chasing away one of my coworkers, we do landscaping and are always short on people, and my boss is a good guy and doesn't deserve that. Or maybe I'll see her at work and we can make amends then. 

And I do still have feelings for her which is why regardless of time of text, I don't want to talk to her while I'm working on myself, but I do want her to know. Anyway any input would help.",relationship_advice,So I (23m) got to Clingy and pushed her(20f) away.,3.0,2022-09-16

I met my boyfriend at a festival, we hung out, had a good time and decided to exchange socials. We soon ended up calling &amp; texting each other daily. I instantly liked him, and all my friends did too.

We went on a few dates and it was just sparks. It felt like a dream. My past with boys hasn’t been great to say the least (i’m aware i’m young but.. shit happens. a lot). But he made me feel special, made me feel seen and heard. We soon made it official and it was my first ever real relationship.

Soon after we made it official however, I found a girl on his snapchat. He didn’t let me read their chats &amp; eventually admitted to me that he met her at a pool and she asked for his socials a couple days prior, and that they’ve been talking. We had a huge fight about this but he eventually apologized to me, tears in his eyes, promising me he’d block her and that he only wanted me. He begged me for another chance, which I stupidly gave him.

After this happened however, he became colder to me. My calls went ignored, texts left on read and at a certain point we hadn’t seen each other in over 3 weeks. It felt like we weren’t in a relationship at all. I’d constantly ask him what was going on, if I was the problem, what I could do to help him etc. But he’d always brush me off. And I foolishly stayed anyways.

Then one day I get a call from a girl I don’t know, I pick up and she goes:
“Hey you’re Luna right? You fucked [boyfriends name] right? Yeah well, he has a girlfriend so.” 
I felt so confused. I’m his girlfriend right?? I called my boyfriend and asked him what was going on, he nervously laughed and said “it’s not what it looks like.” I knew enough.

Turns out, he started dating that girl on his snapchat that we argued about behind my back like a week after he and I made it official. The bastard had two fucking girlfriends. Want to know the worst part? In all the time I have been with him he has never bought me anything. Thats fine, I know he has a lot of money but he’s not obligated to spend it on me at all. However, I found out he spent 500 dollars on gifts and surprises for her. Flowers, nails, food, clothes the whole goddamn nine yards. He once got mad at me because I asked him to BUY ME A DRINK. A DRINK. And he spent 500 on her easily. He had a good relationship with her friends and even her MOTHER. I’ve seen all the proof. 

I decided to meet up with him in real life and the first thing he said to me was “you look dead.” We argued back and forth and things got intense. He says he wants me, he chose me. He dumped her (I saw everything) and he loves me. He wants to be with me. Yet… she’s still in love with him. She knows everything now too (she found out at the same time as me), she knows about me, she knows he was dating me when she met him because i fucking told her. Yet she still wants him. And he keeps unblocking her, calling her back to “argue” etc. I keep telling him to just cut all contact, and he just fucking refuses. After everything! I can’t even put in here everything I did for this man, I gave him my all. My soul, my heart, my body, my energy, my time, my everything. Just for me to get a call saying I fucked him like I was some cheap sidepiece.

And the worst part of everything is, I can’t let him go. Because I know she wants him and she keeps texting him, and (this will sound idiotic) I’m scared that if I leave him, he’ll go back to her and she’ll win. My pride is too big to let her get her way. She’s been nasty to and about me, she’s bitter that he chose me over her. All my life i’ve always been the second option. I’ve always been the fucking other woman. I just don’t want to let her win, I just want to be enough.

I decided to forgo the schedule and just start a group text message and asked everyone to message the group before going to the hospital.  I also decided not to advocate for my dad about my SIL because I figured the fighting it would cause in my family would not be worth it. 
.....,.......,...........

My mother is in the hospital and due to COVID-19 rules, she is only allowed 2 visitors at a time and only between the hours of 8am and 8pm.

She has been in the hospital for almost a week now and at first the visiting went pretty smoothly.

My mom is married with 3 adult children.  My dad stays with her the entire time he's allowed.

I have two school aged kids, so I took the week off work.  I've been dropping the kids off at school and visiting her until it's time to pick them up from school.  Then my sister and her husband leave work early. Her husband gets their kids from school and she comes and visits until my brother gets off work and he can visit- but he only shows up when it's convenient for him.  Not only did he not take off any work, sometimes he doesn't even show up when he says he will.

The problem is, my brother insists on bringing his wife and that forces my dad to go sit in the lobby until they leave.  
Yesterday, being Saturday, I called my siblings to see what time they were planning to visit.  My sister took the morning, and my brother took the afternoon so I planned on visiting in the evening.  When I arrived at 6pm, I got there at the same time as my brother and his wife.  My brother insisted on staying and apologized for being late.  Trying to be nice, I took my dad to the cafeteria to eat dinner but ended up not being allowed to visit my mom.

My brother has teens that can take care of themselves and only had been married a few months.  My husband has been apart of the family for 16 years and is not visiting so my dad doesn't get kicked out of the room nor is my sister's husband who has been apart of the family for nearly 25 years.

Starting Monday, my sister and I are planning on making a schedule on when we can visit.  We plan on both returning to work full time, we both have young kids in a lot of after school activities and we both live an hour from the hospital.  My brother lives 5 minutes from the hospital.

I have also spent my evenings going to my parent's house and cleaning, mowing, etc.  My brother and sister have not been doing that.

Would I be an asshole if I tell my brother needs to visit around the schedule my sister and I make and that he should not bring his wife?

Edit:. My mom wants visitors every second of the day.  She loves the attention.

Second Edit:. My dad is retired and lives about an hour away from the hospital.  He does not want to make multiple trips to the hospital in a day.  He also does leave the room here and there to eat or run to the store to buy her stuff but he doesn't like when sil is there for several hours and he has nothing to do.

Anyways, I (22 M) am the director for a college student organization and we’re having a conference this weekend. A lot of work is going into it since this is our first in person conference since Covid. As people are checking in, “Lois” (22 F), also on the board but a much lower position, comes up to me and ask if she could go back to her room early. She goes on to say that she’s “out of it” and every time she tries to be “helpful” the other people at the table talk over her to handle the incoming guests. I tell her that we need her here for appearance purposes. The EBoard has to be around and helping until opening ceremonies. I offer to swap her role with something else and that she could go sit at a table in the center of the room and take a break. I tell her that I couldn’t let her leave early unless there was something physically wrong with her. She looked at me for a bit and went to sit at a table in the center. When she sits down though, she starts crying. It wasn’t loud, but it was very clear that she was crying. Our advisor and another eboard member goes to check on her and the advisor sends her to her room. He comes to me to say that Lois was going to her room. I was very upset because I need this conference to go well this weekend. Our advisor says that I should have let her go when she first asked. I just think she’s too sensitive. She has the most low stress job out of everyone and she even asked for her own room as an accommodation saying she gets “overstimulated.” I would just like if she fulfilled the role that she was elected to do.

AITA?

Edit:

Did not see this going that way. 

I want to clarify that I respect Lois to the fullest. I believe that she is great for her role that she was elected into outside of this weekend’s conference. She gave me some attitude later on during today when we had to move into different parts of the conference, but nothing major. If I really was an AH, I will apologize and try to explain my side to her later. I agree with some of the comments that she should be given space to handle her issues, but I told her going in that conferences pull a lot out of everyone on the board specifically because we handle all of the business and such. 

Also, Lois has shared that she is awaiting a formal diagnosis for autism, “but it’s pretty much confirmed at this point.” I don’t quite remember her reasoning behind that, but at this point in time she doesn’t have any formal papers or things regarding her accommodations and needs.

Also, not a troll. This actually did happen today and i like to think I’m not usually this rigid of a leader.

Update:

People definitely hate me. Lois and I had a chat everything that happened yesterday. I apologized and explain my own “anxiety” (her word) around the whole conference being back in person this year. She wasn’t the only one that I was really rude to during this weekend. The really harsh feedback from this post has really humbled me.

I can't list or remember every example over the years, but it's worn away at the positive feelings I used to have, and those feelings aren't returning.  Instead of looking forward to her, I feel always ready to defend from another attack.  I hesitate to walk from my car to the house after work.  I don't feel happy to hold her hand or hug her anymore.  It's replaced with anxiety. 

We talk about this as an issue, and she knows it's a problem and expresses desire to change, but she keeps doing it and won't apologize unless I beg her to, which makes it seem hollow.  She does this less often when we talk about it but never truly stops.  She doesn't seem to realize how her words hurt, just that she gets what she wants when she's mean.  

I'm so tired of not being able to love or feel loved.  I want to fix this somehow but I don't know what to do, or if I even can.

I’m so over this. I feel embarrassed that I gave so much. I’m embarrassed that I thought maybe if I over extend myself, he would change or treat me better. I acted like a simp and I am never doing that again.

If it’s selfish, then it’s selfish. I’m done trying to be overly nice to men who don’t treat me the same way. In my experience, too many men in their 20s nowadays are predators and just try to use women for free therapy, sex, or both. I’m sure the good men are out there but I’m done looking, for a long time. 

They’ll claim they care, they’ll say literally anything it takes. They’ll look you in the eyes and tell you they love you more than anything while knowing they’re also on tinder. You could be beautiful, you could be a super model and they’ll still cheat (Adam Levine). You don’t even have to be pretty; men will pretend to like you and use you for sex anyways. 

I believe this “temptation” culture is a plague on young people. Cheating and using/lying is passed off as some kind of joke by the media and most popular music as if it’s no big deal.

This is what I do whenever I travel downtown because parking is extremely limited. I ask the person I’m picking up if there are nearby loading spots, parking, or offer an alternative if parking is limited. He said he confirmed the address and agreed to handle this if difficulties arise.

Once we arrived downtown, as I expected, the block was lined with “NO PARKING” and “NO STOPPING ANY TIME” signs. I pointed that out and kept driving. He asked me to perform an illegal U-turn. I refused, pointing at the sign prohibiting turns at the intersection. He said in frustration, “It’s not like you haven’t done illegal things before!”

I asked him where I should stop and he said “just park here.” I pointed to the “NO PARKING” sign and said I could not park. He directed me down the block and told me to stop. I refused, showing him the “NO STOPPING ANY TIME” sign. He said other people were stopped there. I said coldly that didn’t mean I could break the law as well. He then raised his voice at me, “You’re saying you can’t park here nor there! You’re stressing me out! You’re blaming me and saying it’s all my fault! Then just park where you want to!”

I replied stating nobody was blaming him and never said it was his fault. I told him he had agreed to handle this so I was not responsible for finding parking. I said this is why I asked him to do his due diligence of researching the area and inquiring his friend about parking near the address before we left. I told him this what I have to do every time we go out, and that it’s not as easy as it looks. It may *seem* easy to him because when I drive somewhere, I already know where the parking is since I researched beforehand.

Now I am wasting gas driving around in circles looking for parking because he did not do his research. Finally, he stormed out of the car and said he and his friend would Uber home. AITA for angering him?

EDIT: He said I was being “condescending” and it is true that my tone may not have been the most pleasant. When we left and he agreed to handle it, I knew this problem was going to come up even though he said he got it under control. I just bit tongue and didn’t push it further because I already suggested he do his research first. He is a grown man and can do what he wants.

I've recently passed my driving test. I have not done a lot of hours, passed with luck I guess. I've never driven my bf's car before - only on parking which was not pleasant at all. But I thought, if I pass my driving, he would believe in me more and try to be less hard on me. 

Since I've passed, we've been going on a quick rides around the village or to the shops that are just behind the corner. Which is fine, because me alone do not feel like driving in the city yet (as it is busier than the city I was having driving test in). But anyway, the drives make me so anxious and stressed like nothing else. 

I worry a lot about not breaking his car or hitting something/someone. But I feel like I started 'feeling' the car better, so I think I am gaining more confidence. Which would be awesome, if not the fact that my boyfriend is making me so anxious behind the wheel. I got yelled at to look out for curbs - even tho I am far away from them - I got yelled at by being in 1st gear instead of 2nd right after pulling out of the corner. I am being yelled at whenever I do something that is not perfect for him. 

He has a lot of experience and I have very little - especially with his car. He seems like he understands but also does not. I am trying to tell him that he makes me stressed, which makes me drive worse. He says he will try not to overact as much but then it happens again! 

Today I stalled at the traffic lights but I managed to correct that just in time - well not good enough for him as he got so nervous, got me a silent treatment and I saw so much disappointment on his face. I slowed down on a bent (that he usually drives on normal speed) - and I have been questioned why I even did that - because visibility was reduced. And good I slowed down as there was a fox running just behind the corner. He said sorry, but still - was questioning my careful driving. 

I do not know what to do anymore. I need to drive as we will be moving away and I have to have a transport without being dependent on him. But I feel like this is an issue - which I am not sure is because of me or him or us both. 

I don't really know how to talk, what to do with him as nothing helps.

I know this was just their way of saying they just don't want one with me but I wish this would stop happening...

We have great conversations and, unfortunately, arguments that we (I think) recover from but they always change this mind about me. For examples, one time, the guy and I were talking for 3 months without meeting and eventually, I felt like we weren't meeting because he had a gf, I asked his about it and he said he didn't. I ultimately decided to let go and 2 months, he posts him and his new gf.. 

The second time this happened, I met someone online and we instantly clicked on our first date. We saw each other for a few weeks before he also stopped being responsive and changed what he wanted with me. I eventually found out that this one did have a gf the last time I went over to his place (from snooping). He had been cheating on said gf with me and others, but they are now are now married. 

More recently, I met someone that I really enjoyed talking to again and saw myself being with in the long run.

except for Hardip... Fuck Hardip.
This is the email I sent to basically everyone with power in the company, including board members, CEO, CFO and more.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I tender my resignation effective immediately.

I have returned any company property that was in my possession.
My company laptop and Corporate Credit Card is on the desk in the IT Room in Anytown GROW.
My profile has already been wiped from the company-provided laptop.
I have removed any company documents from my personal devices and accounts.

This has been an adventure.
For those who may not know me personally, I am the only I.T. Field Tech in the Eastern Time Zone and have worked for the last year, 4 months, and 18 days to keep the east coast operation’s IT tools working and within legal compliance.
I have enjoyed much of my journey with ""Generic Weed Facility #4"", but it is time for me to move on.

I can no longer stomach the disrespect, accusations, and lies of my manager Hardip.
He is a horrible communicator and outright rude to almost all who interact with him.
I went 5 months without even hearing his voice and for a manager that is unacceptable.
Even if he completely trusted me to do my job, which I’m sure he doesn’t, not speaking with an employee on your team for that long is ludicrous. 
I cannot recall Hardip saying or writing the phrases “thank you” or “you did a good job” even once in the entire time I have been employed at ""Generic Weed Facility #4"".
Not to me. Not to anyone.
My opinion is that if you want your company to succeed, you should replace him with someone who has the capability to learn and grow without retaliating against other employees.
He constantly berates employees in group chats and sends accusatory messages instead of asking questions.
He never asks his employees about situations before attacking them.
He never returns calls, texts, or Teams messages in a timely manner and then blames you for not trying hard enough to get a hold of him.
You will update him on a current situation and months will pass before he suddenly believes it to be a dire situation and he won’t acknowledge that you informed him previously.
He has no idea how long a task takes if there is only one technician working on it. He expects a single tech to run cable and troubleshoot issues as fast as multiple techs, which is unfair and unreasonable.
He gatekeeps all the technology so that he feels irreplaceable, but it only causes everything to take way longer than it should, making all decisions go through him.
He does not delegate responsibility.
He wastes money on tech upgrades that are not necessary, and then prevents purchases of needed items due to “budget constraints”.
He constantly creates roadblocks that prevent employees from being able to effectively do their jobs, then blames them for not getting things done on time when his lack of response (authorization) was the cause of the delay.
He cannot accept any criticism (positive or negative) without retaliating.
He is not a good manager, and if anyone doubts these accusations, please be aware that I am taking a dramatic pay cut just to get this negative personality out of my life forever.

I expect Hardip to drag my name through the mud after I am gone, but I implore you to ask the people that I interacted with if they believed me to be a bad employee. My regular clients always knew where they stood with constant updates, and while I may have temporarily forgotten to do a small task here or there, my tasks were always addressed as well as I could. Nobody is perfect, but I tried my best to do all that I could, and I never stopped giving my best even as I was on my way out of the company. 

When he complains that I was slow or lazy, just ask yourself these questions. Was there an SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) detailing the task and how it was expected to be handled? Was it late because Raven575 didn’t want to work or because he was waiting for authorization to travel or waiting months for a part to arrive due to it not being ordered in a timely fashion? Was it done slowly because Raven575 was a bad employee or was the speed expectation based on the estimate of multiple techs performing the task instead of a single tech?

I will probably be blamed for ""Generic Weed Facility #15"" not being ready for Inspection, but I recommended (while in a meeting with Hardip and HR) that we needed a full-time tech in the New England area. At that time, Hardip responded that “he was working on it”. It is now the end of November, and we are scrambling to get everything done. I was not sent out to New England until the end of November and had 4-1/2 days to get everything done. That just wasn’t enough time to complete the laundry list of tasks that needed to be addressed in all the area’s Dispensaries and Grow facility. This could have been avoided if we had hired someone for that location months ago. As a side note, if you don’t believe that I worked hard while on my last trip, I have included a PDF outlining my trip including GPS data to prove that I did not slack in my efforts to accomplish all the tasks set before me.

Now for the bright side…
Everyone I worked with on a daily basis was fantastic. 
Mario Mario is a fantastic IT person and, in my opinion, should be promoted to CIO (Chief Information Officer). 
He has a great understanding of what it takes to get things done and isn’t afraid to ask questions and take other thoughts into consideration when making decisions.
Daniel Tiger is a great IT tech and has been very helpful in every interaction I’ve had with him.
The whole NetJargon team is awesome and super helpful and informative.
Every store manager I’ve worked with has been great and appreciative of the work that I’ve done to try and make their daily lives easier and more efficient.
Everyone in the Anytown locations are great and doing their best to make a good product and help each other out.
Bert and Ernie in HR here in Anytown are rockstars and do amazing things to help everyone that they work with.
Princess Diana is a sweetheart, a hard worker for the Inventory Team and deserves all the praise you can give her.
Karl Marx is a beautifully realistic and caring worker that does a great job keeping the Anytown facility running smooth.
Michael Clarke Duncan is a fantastic man with great ideas and a terrific work attitude.
Carrie Fisher is a brilliant chef and manager that is probably not paid enough for the amazing work she does creating the best edibles that I’ve ever tried….seriously, she is a Queen.

I feel like this company can do amazing work and help hundreds of thousands of people with their goods and services, but I also feel like there have been a bunch of mistakes leading to many talented employees leaving due to poor management decisions.

With all that said…
I have learned a lot during my time here, mostly self-taught due to a lack of training.
I hope all the best for everyone that has been helpful and patient through difficult times of waiting and red tape to get things done.

Procrastination is delaying doing something that you have to get done. This is not because you are lazy. It is actually a safety mechanism. There is a part of your brain called the amygadala, which is responsible for the flight or fight response in your brain. It pumps stress hormones and causes fear, anxiety and inaction.  You see anxiety can also work as excitement. Anxiety and Excitement are on the same spectrum but just manifest in different ways. 

So instead of thinking about would could go wrong(causes anxiety).You should think about what would go right. Here are some examples:

1) instead of thinking that work is hard and boring, you want to create a feeling of excitement. So in order to do that. You have to realise that you want to crush this project. You want to win and destroy competetion (I can already feel my excitement)

2) Talking to the other gender. You are too worried about what could go wrong. Instead focus on what could go right. Like imagine the fun, you talk to this person, they talk to you. You have a fun time and you like talking ti new people.( Boom we created excitement) 

3) Fear of public speaking, again you are too worried about the negative opinions of others. You need to think like this "" I'll go up there and I'll talk, ill make them love me, they will clap for me and ill win their hearts. I like speaking . ( boom excitement) 


As you can see: you can convert your lack of motivation into excitement which causes motivation,makes work and being social so much easier and more fun. 

Here's a Tld;r: if you want to feel motivation focus on what could go right, never what could go wrong. The more you worry the more it'll slow you down. So control your thoughts and lead them in the right direction for a better life",socialskills,How to end Procrastination.,2.0,2022-12-23

Example, my dad didn’t talk to me or seen my children (7 year old boy, 4 year old girl, my fiancé was pregnant at the time. 8 months to be exact.) for over a year. I attempted many times to get ahold of him. I tried calling, texting and telling my sister to have him call me but never did. So one day, my family and I was on vacation at Wisconsin Dells, my aunt called me saying he was in town. My dad and I talked and wanted to visit us. He would buy us dinner and then spend time with us. 

I talked it over with my fiancé and she agreed for him to come over the next day after our trip. The next day, he called me and said he was on his way over. It was around 1 PM and it would have taken him about 45 minutes for him to are at my house. About 2 hours later, he called and proclaimed he was “lost”. I gave him directions again. So once again, we we’re waiting. My kids we’re getting extremely anxious because they were excited to see their grandpa. They haven’t seen him for over a year. Approximately year and half to be exact. 

5 HOURS LATER! We fed our kids because it was almost 8 pm and it was bedtime. My dad finally came over. He acted, really strange and I had a strange feeling about him. It was to the point it was awkward. We talked for a little bit before we went to the store. My dad and I went to the store after I put the kids to bed. 

Note: he spent maybe an hour with my kids. They we’re getting crabby because they were extremely exhausted from our vacation. 

We talked a little more and he said he was going through a rough time and I understood. He said he’s getting a new place on the 1st (it was a couple days before the 1st) and he was working strange hours. I listened when he talked but the awkwardness never left me. I felt he was lying to me. So we got the pizzas and went home. Before we got home he asked if he could spend the night. I discussed it with my fiancé and she agreed but he had to leave when I went to work. So fast forward in the morning, when he left, we hugged goodbye but it was super awkward! I never had that feeling before with my dad. I kinda blew it off. 

After work, I called my aunt to talk to her about the visit. She told me he was back to drinking. He has a huge issue of drinking in the past. He lost jobs, became homeless and had a couple of DUIs. So at the time, he was homeless and jobless. What I know of, my sister is helping him getting into a shelter in Madison and getting back on his feet. 

I was so upset he went back to drinking and not to mention, lying to me. I honestly don’t want that in my kids life. I haven’t talked to my dad in a couple of months. I’m planning on talking to him to express my feelings. So am I the asshole for not inviting my dad to my wedding?
