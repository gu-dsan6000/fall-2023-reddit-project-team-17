i’m young. like, bordering on 20. and i don’t desire sex, at all.

i’m not asexual; i even used to be very sexual. not hypersexual, but very sex positive (i mean i still am, just not for myself lol) and wanting to have sex multiple times a week. and it’s all suddenly gone.

i *want* to want to have sex, and i just don’t. i am the luckiest person in the world that my partner doesn’t care. they say that it doesn’t matter, and that at first they didn’t understand and took it personally but we worked through it and i clarified it has absolutely nothing to do with them. and it’s true. i wish i wanted to have sex, mostly for their sake, because i’m terrified i’ll never get my sex drive back and that they’ll eventually break things off because they won’t want a relationship with no sex.

if we were together longer and much older, i wouldn’t fear that, but we’re young and sex influences like, at LEAST 60% of what my generation prioritizes. and everyone’s horny, and everyone’s hooking up, and it’s natural. i wish i could go back to that. so that my partner doesn’t break and cheat on me. 

realistically i don’t think they would ever cheat because they have such a strong moral compass but i do fear that one day they will be so worn out from a relationship absent of sex and need out. but i love them so much. i love most the parts of our relationship that have nothing to do with sex.

basically i’m just scared of the future and want my libido back. i want to feel normal again. sometimes i cry because i feel so broken. i’m worried it’ll never come back.",0,0,TrueOffMyChest,t5_2yuqy,nsfw,i hate that i don’t want to have sex anymore.,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/l36qwf/i_hate_that_i_dont_want_to_have_sex_anymore/,promo_adult_nsfw,7.0

To keep it short and simple, I talked to my therapist about a terribly toxic and unhealthy relationship I only left last year. It was on and off for three years, I can't even really recall how many times we've split only to get back together. It would take me ages to explain how much of a wreck this relationship was, how terribly I was treated, how incredibly unstable and mentally ill my partner was, so I won't.

I explained to my therapist of a ""bad sexual experience"" I had with my partner. I don't want to go into detail, but there was drugs, coercion, and a lot of guilt-tripping involved. I was also literally a minor, and they were not (I know, how smart am I). Anyways, I finished the story and my therapist, with a disgusted and shocked expression, tells me that my story is the definition of rape. 

I went numb, I cried, and I spilled more ""bad sexual experiences"". I went home that day feeling numb, only to burst out into tears any chance I was alone. I opened up to my current partner about it, and once again was confirmed that I was, in fact, raped.

I know these questions will come up.. I never even thought to consider the experience rape because I was under my ex's influence. I trusted this person my entire life. I convinced myself they could never hurt me, but looking back with a new perspective, I can't even count how many times I was hurt.

I've found myself needing to constantly be distracted or busy. Today was the busiest and most productive days I've had in a long time because the second I am alone or not doing something, I burst into tears. Even now, I am writing this to distract myself.

These past few days have been an emotional wreck. It feels like the five stages of grief, only it is sporadic and in random order. One minute I am ashamed of my stupidity, the next I am wishing for this person to suffer the way I did. 

As a woman, I have feared that this day would maybe come, but never in a million years did I think I would hear the words ""rape victim"" to describe me. It hurts. It really does hurt.

I guess I'm not too sure why I'm posting this. I'm not even sure if I'm asking for help, that could be against the rules without my knowledge.

I just don't know how to continue. I don't know how to even begin healing. I don't know what's next. I don't know if I am ever going to open up to my parents, right now I am too embarrassed.

I'm frightened of my future. I am terrified that I am going to see their face. What really fucking hurts is that we ended on good terms (we have not spoken since April 2020) and they don't know I am suffering.

If you have made it this far, thank you for reading my story. I know I am not alone, but solitude is all that I feel right now.

POSSIBLE ABUSE

Hi redditors, obligatory on my mobile. I’m kinda terrified to type this and I’m starting to feel myself panic but here we go.

On 2nd January I noticed I had a message request on Facebook from my ex boyfriend wishing me a Happy New Year. I very stupidly answered him and said happy new year back. I know I shouldn’t have but I did. We messaged back and forth and today he told me his ex that he dated after me was abusive towards him. I told him that I was sorry he went through that and that despite us having broken up years ago I wanted him to be happy (which is true but I want everyone to be happy, which he knows).

Now, the problem is, we dated from I think 2017-2018. It was literally only a year if that either way. BUT, he didn’t treat me the best. He would finger me without consent, he would pressure me into giving him a HJ and he constantly put me down. He even said once that my belly is fat and that most men don’t like that and aren’t attracted to that but that “it’s OK because I love you anyway”. He would also freak out on me if I didn’t tell him every little thing that was going on with me. Like for example I felt unwell and he freaked out on me because I didn’t tell him. 

Because of this, I’m scared of intimacy and every time I try something with myself I can’t let myself go because I instantly get flashbacks of him fingering me without consent. I know that probably doesn’t count as sexual abuse but for some reason it’s affected me. I still don’t want him to go off on me for saying I’ll never want to get back together with him cause it may be my fault I may have accidentally given him the wrong impression so I guess what I wanna know is, how do I let him down gently?

He is 100% the guy I want to spend the rest of my life with, and the feeling is mutual. I couldn't ever see myself with anyone else. We are otherwise very affectionate/intimate with each other (cuddles, kisses, embarrassing pet names, etc) but we rarely have sex. Maybe once every 6-8 weeks.

I have an extremely low sex drive (I can't remember the last time I masturbated), which could be due to a combination of issues. I've never been a hugely sexual person anyway. I suffer depression and anxiety brought on by low self-esteem, and have struggled with eating disorders and self-harm since I was 10.  I take anti-depressants for said issues (and have done for 4 years), which massively help my mental health but could also be affecting my libido. I'm on birth control (Nexplanon implant). Lastly, my partner and I live together and are very 'comfortable' with each other. We had loads of sex when we first started dating and we sometimes used very light bondage/toys (blindfolds, handcuffs, vibrators). I know it's common for sex to be less frequent in long-term relationships.

In all honesty, I don't miss sex at all but I know it's not healthy to have a sexless relationship. I worry my boyfriend might leave me eventually. He's been taking the same SSRI medication I do for a year and he thinks it has impacted his sex drive but he definitely wants sex more than I do. I wondered if I was asexual for a bit, but I'm not sure that's it; when I'm drunk I can't keep my hands off him and some of the best sex we've had is when we've both been drunk together. My boyfriend has suggested that he goes down on me, fingers me, etc but I have absolutely zero interest. I am still extremely attracted to him, get butterflies etc so it can't be that either.

I'm a 24 YO man in the USA. There was always a problem since I was a kid. Abuse at home, bullies at school, it was always something. As long as I remember I wasn't happy. Sometimes I get glimpses of happiness like most people, but then again most times sucked. some years back i was diagnosed with Unstable Personality Disorder previously known as Borderline PD, PTSD and dysthymia usually known as a light long term depression; but I'm not so lucky ""usually""- (I will go into it more if anyone is actually interested in reading this) -so its more like heavy long term depression for me. my personal cocktail of issues.

Today it'll mostly be about my father. To put it lightly I have daddy issues.

My dad is an educated man. A nurse practitioner; so he certainly is smart but he also overestimates himself at most things because of his knowledge. He calls psychiatrists psychotic; he calls me psychotic, he calls his favorite video game psychotic when he is loosing. He has no formal training to specialize in psychology; but I'm sure he figures himself smarter than all of them.

My father was abused and is mentally ill himself although he thinks himself just depressed and keeps his feelings close so no-one has ever diagnosed him with anything as far as I'm aware. (details for another post if people a interested in knowing more about him.) But I will give an overview for the sake of the story and my relief. His mother was very abusive. she would do things like make him kneel on a cheese grater, hit him on the head with hard objects, and in general beat him like a dog and an abusive owner. as much as I have hate for my father I love him too maybe it doesn't make sense to others but I can feel both for my father at the same time.

And now the main event; my childhood. My father was all the abusive's (physical, emotional, ETC.) towards me even though I'm his self-proclaimed favorite and to try and make up for my mothers injustices in my childhood (my mother is once again another post) I was spanked, belted, whipped, punched, slapped, scratched, scored and worst of all manipulated by both my parents. Dear mother and dear father both had their favorites of course and least favorites and its sometimes hard to say who did what since my mind tried to protect itself by forgetting as much as possible. but there are the obvious ones like my mother using her nails and my father punching when he was really angry. but then there are the less obvious ones like who was viscous enough to whip a child, well that award goes to my mother. I guess our family doesn't have good luck with mothers.

My dad once or twice said he'd kill me if I didn't clean off my nails when i painted them. he's punished me for no reason at times.

He even was holding a knife and got angry once so he tried to hit me with it, but of course I raised my hand so it wouldn't be my head or face and got slashed on the back of my hand that gave me a scar I still have.

And then there was the time I dropped a glass cup and it shattered so he told me to pick it up but when I went to pick it up he pushed me into the pile of broken glass and so a large piece slashed my knee that gave me an even bigger scar. I didn't even go to the hospital for that one.

The cherry on top? I still live with him because I'm disabled and can't afford to live alone, so there's a new verbal abuse just about everyday.

There's more of course but I think they all deserve their own posts: Fathers past, my mother, my brother and more about my life or more specific events like the thanksgiving event, my first time living with my mother only (my parents got separated when I was 8 or so), and the second time years later, also things like living with my father and brother on different occasions; living with only my dad and lastly my accident. so if you want to read more just tell me which one i should write about first.

TL:DR:

I'm mentally ill; It's my families fault. They abused me and still do verbally all these years later, even sometimes physical if it comes down to it. They want me to forgive and forget but I don't think I ever will. Because its effected me for life probably.",0,0,TrueOffMyChest,t5_2yuqy,nsfw,"My father, family and my dark past",https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/l4fr7m/my_father_family_and_my_dark_past/,promo_adult_nsfw,0.5

If you've made it to this line then dw you are done with the post.

But here is some full context for people who are curious about my reasons for this 
In the several relationships I have had, which all lasted multiple years, my girlfriends did not care much about my issues or feelings, they did not compliment me at all, they never gave any indication of appreciating me. The closest I ever got with any of them was that in the beginning of these relationships they would tell me how happy I made them, which felt great at the time obviously. But they never said anything apart from that - my value as a person to them was purely a matter of what value could be extracted from me, and this became really clear at the end of these relationships. These people were all my friends before they asked me out, and they were very good friends. And all of the issues that came up and made me decide that dating girls is not for me are things I spent years talking to them about with them wholeheartedly agreeing with me on before we started dating, and then they changed their minds on them midway through our relationship. I know that there are people out there who will not act like that. But also women are taught that they should be the pursued in relationships, and men are taught to be the pursuers. It is for that reason that I find it so much easier to find men who will listen to, and care about me, and consciously try to make me feel worthwhile, and value me, and make me feel attractive. And trying to find a woman that will give me that after all my previous experiences just feels like a huge time and emotional investment I will have to make several more times before it eventually pays off, and it might never pay off. And those are basically the main things I actually want from a relationship. 

Also for the record I am not trying to be anti-women in this post or make out like men are the real victims in relationships or whatever. Men and women are both complete arseholes in their own way as a result of how society has taught them to behave. There are lots of distasteful things men constantly do in relationships which I am well aware of (basically all my close friends are girls and we discuss our relationship woes extensively) but none of those shitty things are really deal breakers for me or make me feel that bad. For example the guy I hooked up with the very first time who made me realise how good being with guys could be tried to physically force me to deepthroat him after he asked and I said no. This guy was really nice to me the whole night, I am 100% sure that if I had met him in college during the day rather than at a club I would have just made friends with him and never known he was the kind of person who would do that. Obviously that is an objectively horrific thing to do, I am aware that some people would find that scarring, and if I found out someone had done that to one of my friends I would want to beat the shit out of them.

I dated Tom for a month in high school and once before that, so we care about each other but have no romantic feelings. When I was dating Tom, Ashley threatened to end out friendship (not the first time) because Tom had been mean to her in the past. (In the past, she did something I warned her not to do and she did it anyway and got her feelings hurt.) Tom and I are in good grounds as friends and Ashley is my friend too, although tumultuous. 

Three days ago I was spending time with Ashley (we were safe and social distancing) and she openly referred to Tom as public enemy #1 in a serious way, that shows you how much she doesent like him. And he really didn’t care about her That much. 

Last night they both sent me pictures of each others dating profiles because they had matched together. I was talking to both of them while they were talking to eachother (odd situation, I know.) Ashley went from saying “I’m gonna fuck with him” and “I’m gonna make him cry” while Tom just went along with it and was messing with her too. Then Ashley started planning a hook up and is sending seductive videos, later on the planned a date which they are apparently on right now. I seriously don’t care what they do because I don’t have romantic feelings for either but I am worried when it all blows up there is gonna be drama and Ashley will be upset at Tom and me. However I was clear that I want no part in whatever happens. 

Here’s where I might be the asshole, 2ish hours ago Ashley snaps me to text her and say we are hanging out. I ask why, she makes excuses and tells me to do it, I say no until she tells me what’s goin on. She needs me to pretend that we are hanging out so she can sneek out of her parents house (she’s 19) to go see him. I initially said no because I want no part of this but she gave me so much grief and whining that she would do it for me and yada yada so I did it. 

I also be the asshole here too, after this happened I texted Tom and let him know that Ashley would be bitching about me because I didn’t help her sneak out. He asked why and I said that I wasn’t going to be involved, snd he said ok.

What happeded was that my mom, my dad, and my grandma were watching football and I was on my phone browsing reddit in a furry subreddit on my phone. I came across a YouTube video that have a compilations of furry memes. I accidentally closed the app and I went to resume it by clicking the YouTube notification with out reading it. It turns out that it was asking to share it to another device. I bet all of you can guess what device it sent the video to. I am surprised that I didn't get a heart attack the moment ""Furry meme V5"" showed up on the TV. I started to panic when my grandma started to read the memes as them came up (the post was marked NSFW so I was scared of what could show up) until I decided to restart my phone which stoped the streaming.
Now I am pretty sure they all know that I am a furry now. 

This alone would realy be a much of a fuck up  however, I am more worried about how my dad and grandma will react. My dad is a very politically conservative so the fact that his son is a furry might not go over very well. For my grandma, I am not worried about what she thinks of me as much as what she might say to others. She tends to talk nonstop and I can easy see she speaks to other family members about me being a furry.

TL;DR I streamed furry memes to the TV they my family was watching and kniw they all know I am a furry.

I recently discovered he has a porn addiction. He admitted it to me after we had an argument about him lying about watching porn. I was mostly upset because of how he lied to me (he gaslighted me, swore on my life that he never watched porn, and was making a lot of false reassuring statements) and because it affects our sex life. I never really had an issue with this in past relationships. I think the reason it bothers me now is because I am not satisfied with our sex life since he has ED. I always feel sad after sex. I tried asking him about it nicely and tried my best to make him feel comfortable to open up with me about it, but he kept denying using porn. So I ended up doing something I still feel bad about...I snooped on his computer. And of course I found porn. I am diagnosed with PTSD and have trust issues. He knows lying is a big deal to me. He's lied to me about big things in the past... So yeah I am really struggling with trusting him right now because of how easy it was for him to lie to me the way he did. 

He decided that he was going to stop watching it so he can overcome his addiction and improve our sex life. He wants me to help and be supportive and I'm trying my best. I suggested downloading an accountability app to help, but he was reluctant and tried arguing with me about it. He ended up getting it after I convinced him to. I decided that I do not want to be his accountability partner so I asked him to remove me from the app today. I don't think it is healthy for me to be checking the reports everyday and ""babysitting"" him. Today I suggested seeing a therapist specialized in this type of addiction together. He immediately said no and started to argue. But after I explained why it would help the both of us, he agreed. Every time I suggest something, he argues with me. I did ask him if he would be comfortable with me being able to see his internet history. The reason why I want to be able to see it is to help hold him accountable and to help rebuild trust. I don't plan on checking his history daily or very frequently because it would not be healthy for either of us, but if I suspect he relapsed I would like to see with my own eyes whether he did or didn't. It is hard for me to blindly trust him with this right now and I know some might say I just need to learn to trust....but I  cannot right now. So being able to see the truth with my own eyes will help rebuild that trust. Addicts will do anything they can to lie and mislead others and I just need to have physical proof that he isn't doing that anymore. I've been doing a lot of research into porn addiction and have surfed through some porn addiction subreddits here and a lot of them say to never trust a porn addict or any type of addict. Idk I just don't want to be lied to about this again....... 

I don't know what to do anymore. Everything I suggest he always has a problem with. Even if what I am suggesting would help me trust him with this stuff. How should I go about this? Should I just stay out of it and not help with his addiction? Has anyone else dealt with this successfully? How can I trust him again?

My gf is a very nervous person when it comes to physical intimacy (which she disclosed to me the start of our relationship). It took her awhile to get comfortable with stuff like making out and other forms of physical intimacy. About a year ago we finally reached a point where we were ready to start discussing sex. Unfortunately, she is unable to fit something large down there without pain so we’ve been working with dilators to try and get to a point where we can finally have sex (I should add She’s been to a doctor about it and apparently everything is ok physically so that isn’t the issue). However, while we’ve made progress, it has been slow and I suspect we have at least another 6 months (possibly more if the next sizes turn out to be even more challenging.) and possibly longer till we reach a point where we can have sex. 

While I am comfortable giving oral she is not (which I totally respect and have never pushed her on) comfortable reciprocating so my release is usually by hand or grinding. It also doesn’t help that I have a higher (although not dramatically) libido than her and that she has a tough time initiating sex. While it was ok for a while, I’ve been starting to feel sexually unfulfilled with the intimacy we have and it's beginning to feel like this aching hole in our relationship. 

I know this is something she worries about, she worries that I’m not happy sexually and that I’m going to grow to resent that she’s unable to have sex with me yet. When this has come up, I’ve reassured her that while obviously like her I wish we could have sex now, I’m doing fine and theres no rush. I love her very much and am very happy in our relationship otherwise, but the truth is I am having a pretty tough time. I’m worried that telling her this will not only upset her and increase her anxiety, making her feel pressured to go through the dilators faster (which would likely have an inverse effect). Does anyone have any advice for someone in this situation? Should I say something to her? If so what? I really feel like I could use some outside perspective.

So I'm a very horny person, which isn't particularly special a lot of people are horny. I also have ADHD which makes my libido literally the most distracting thing ever. So for most people the easiest thing to do about this is masterbation. Here's the thing,  I'm a  trans guy and that shits just not going to happen until I get bottom surgery. Luckily I am gay and I have an asshole, you have an asshole everyone has an asshole. Here's the thing about assholes though, you might know this but there's a shit ton of shit in there and you kind of well shitty fingers. So there was only one thing my cheap gay ass could do. I could buy a douche and other anal sex toy supplies.

So I go on Amazon, I text a buddy of mine he knows the asshole very well. He tells me what to get and I decided like why not go all out and get a little heart choker just for fun. So I buy it and unbeknownst to myself I forgot to check the shipping address and instead of shipping to my campus mailroom. I ended up shipping it to my dad.

I'm wondering when the hell my box was when it said it was shipped and it was nowhere to be found and I didn't think to much of it because I don't think. Then I receive a call. It's from my dad. I answer the phone wondering what bible verse he's going to preach on today. He said the usual boring stuff he always does and blah blah blah whatever and then he says so i received a package with your name on it. I so immediately realize what was fucking going down my blood pressure was sky rocketing my heart was running marathons all my brain kicked to it's primitive senses. So I'm over here freaking out and he says. Do you want me to ship it to you? I desperately say yes. Then he said I opened it and then he proceeds to name the things inside the package and I foolishly said I wouldn't order such things. He was like yeah right whatever and my mind blacked out for the rest of the phone call. I spent the rest of my evening panicking but that was nothing compared to the phone call with my mother. She straight up started thinking that I was being forced to buy sex toys by some creepy guy on the internet. Which isn't at all what was happening. Im not going to give you the phone call because I don't want to reawaken the memories of the traumatizing phone call, but I will say my mother says to not watch porn because if you do you'll end up as a sex slave. That's was the moment that I knew that my mom had never been on a porn site. She also said don't watch porn because it's mean to women but she knows I'm gay. So I don't know what brain lag she was having lol.

My bf and I were having sexy time and he finished on my face. Now, I don’t know if anyone else has had this experience, but whenever I get cum in my eyes, it is like every sperm is swimming to the back of my brain and my eyes instantly swell up, turn BRIGHT red and start burning like they are on fire. Well as soon as he finished and his cum drenched my eyelids I knew what was coming. I shut my eyes hard and peeled my fake eyelashes off and told him to lead me to the bathroom so I could try to rinse my face off before it started... seeping in. Once I was in the bathroom, he left to go get dressed. I really didn’t want to open my eyes because it would be ten times worse if I opened them without rinsing them first so I just kept them tightly shut and I was feeling around trying to find the faucet handle. I hit something with my arm and heard it fall, but assumed it was a bottle of lotion or something. 
The sink was filling up and just as I was about to stick my whole face in, my bf walks back in and grabs me and yanks me back and says something along the lines of “holy fuck I almost just killed my gf with my cum.” I’m very confused so I finally feel around for a towel to wipe my face off enough and open my eyes a crack to see that I had knocked my PLUGGED IN HAIRDRYER into the full sink and almost plunged my whole head in.

He likes it a little bit more hardcore. 

I on the other had never slept with a guy before, only played a little with my ex which he knows about. I like the idea of more hardcore sex and could totally do a lot for my partner in bed however for my first time I need things to be a little bit more delicate. 

We know each other for 6 months and live together for 1,5 month we're also a couple since few days before we started living with each other but there was something in the air way before that. We rushed a lot but it's how life forced us to do. 

He pleasures me a lot but I never get to pleasure him or he seems interested in sex but I don't see him erected. There was one time when I wanted to satisfy him but he couldn't get erection and just told me to stop. I didn't want to pressure him but I told him that I don't understand why I get so rarely to please him. After being very hesitant to tell me he said that he was hard for me a lot of times and almost every time we do something but he restrained himself a lot because he knows it's my first time and that he loves my body but he really likes me and doesn't want to f something up.

.... 

So as you see there are a lot of factors and I'm confused. Can you help me get things clear? The worst thing first, he might be already bored with me because we started living with each other so early and the magic spark disappeared. Other scenario is that he can only get hard for hardcore stuff which if he didn't lie that he was hard for me a lot is not true. Next thing is that because he was with a lot of girls he might idk feel exhausted of pointless sex or have bad memories with it? I really idk. And he really might feel pressure of not ruining things for this first time.

It looked minor, but after I pulled over, I noticed a smoking heap of metal under the bridge. It was across the 3 lane highway. My heart immediately dropped. I found a big enough break in traffic to sprint across to find a woman still moving and alive, but pinned in, on the passenger side. I did my best to comfort her and tell her that she was okay, and that help was on the way. She kept telling me that she was holding someone's hand, but was absolutely out of it due to the pain, so I didn't really think much of it. I continued to talk with her to distract her from the situation until she said it again, and that she didn't know who it was this is when I realized that she was the passenger. I immediately told her to sit tight, walked around to the other side, and there was a man, so messed up that he had to have been long dead. His door was missing, twisted metal was everywhere, and I couldn't stand to look at him for more than a few seconds. I walked back to her almost in tears, and kept trying to cheer her up until the fire department arrived. 
She held his hand the entire time.
The ems people told me to leave, so I did. I probably won't ever know if either of them survived. 


From what I understood from a witness, he did a multi-lane change with no turn signal and hit an ride share driver before losing control. I assume that the two pinned in the car were in a relationship, and now she will have to face the horror of finding out what happened to him. 

Her brain probably subconsciously wouldn't let her remember who was in the driver's seat in order to protect her. 

I feel completely destroyed after being there, and I just hope that she is okay.

EDIT: thanks everyone for the super kind words. I feel a bit better today, so I will be fine. I think the worst part now is that she was innocently riding with her partner, and his actions were what caused the wreck.

I applied it last night.

Cue this morning. My boy and I were getting frisky in bed when he decides to go down under. I'm so horny at this point I didn't even consider the fact that vaginal anti itch cream probably isn't intended for human consumption. He starts giving me the one-two with his tongue, when suddenly he bursts up from between my legs and starts gagging.

He ran to the bathroom spitting and washing his mouth out, while I'm crying with laughter on the bed, realizing what happened.

As it turns out, when applied to the tongue the cream tastes pretty bad and knocks out your sense of taste. We had a good laugh and he's totally fine.

TL;DR: my pussy's so good it has the power to remove taste buds

EDIT: People seemed really concerned about my vagina, so I guess I have to clarify that no i don't have any signs of infection, nor do i have any STDs. Vaginal itching can commonly be caused by using scented laundry detergent, dry skin (I live in a cold climate, where the air is very dry and it's frequent for other parts of my skin to dry and itch because of this), using the wrong kind of soap/body wash, or general irritation.

The specific part that was itchy was the lower part of my labia majora (outer lips) where there's a lot of pubic hair that frequently rubs together. I have a small, closed lip vagina, which causes the pubic hair in that area to rub together quite a bit, which I suspect also led to the itching. That's where I put the cream. I suspect that as I laid down and shuffled in the night, some of the cream might have rubbed onto my underwear and thus spread a little onto the upper parts of my vagina, which is what caused my dear boyfriend to get a numb tongue. Since, again, I have a closed lip vagina, his tongue has to do a bit of a deep dive to access the actual clit.

First I wanna say sorry for my English as I am not a native speaker. Also sorry for the formatting as I am writing this on my phone. And I’m sorry if some of this is not making sense, it’s in the middle of the night and i am really a mess right now. 

 My boyfriend (m25) and I (f20) went to bed at around midnight today. I had to get up 6 hours later, so I just wanted to sleep. Like 5 minutes after we went to bed, he shoved his hand under my blanked and started touching me. I tried to push away his hand, as I wanted to fall asleep. He didn’t care about that and started trying to finger me. I again tried to push his hand away but he pushed against me too hard for me to do anything. He tried fingering me for like half an hour, playing around with my clit and unsuccessfully trying to insert his fingers into me (it didn’t work because I was not getting aroused at all).
I didn’t clearly say no or stop or anything but I tried to push away his hand multiple times. I clearly didn’t want this. I feel miserable now to be honest. 
I don’t know how to approach this, as i know how he reacts to rejection. If I don’t want to have sex with him, he is really offended and doesn’t talk to me for a day. 
Lately I don’t really have any libido anymore, I just don’t want or need sex. I do, however, still sleep with him because he makes me do it. I always do it willingly even though I don’t really want it (if that makes sense?). 
He guilt trips me into sleeping with him because I don’t want him to be offended and not talking to me for a day. 

I feel like I should talk about this to him but I really don’t know how I should bring that up later (I have to leave soon and I will come back in the afternoon and I know he will be acting like nothing happened). How do I bring that up? And also, am I even in a position to say anything as I didn’t clearly say no / stop when he did that? 

I would really appreciate every kind of advice...

Just as a heads up, a lot of this will probably be a bit TMI, I'm honestly just really curious about this but don't want to ask my friends this because I feel like it's a weird question.

So I'm a 15 year old girl, and my sexuality is asexual panromantic (I don't experience sexual attraction but am romantically attracted to all genders). I've tried watching some porn and I've found that for me, it's quite honestly unappealing. I completely understand why it would be enjoyable for someone and I'm not judging anyone who does enjoy it, it's just not for me. It feels really emotionally disconnected for me, and I just feel super awkward when I watch it, rather than getting any satisfaction from it.
On the other hand, when I read fanfiction of two fictional characters (of any gender, if it matters) getting it on or even of a character having s*x with a self-insert reader (judge me all you want, I really don't care), it honestly feels quite arousing for me, at least I think that's what that feeling is??

Mid October 2020 (2.5 months ago) it was implicated that she doesn't like the idea of me masturbating, so I've since stopped. However, studies have found a correlation with an increased risk of prostate cancer and less ejaculation &amp; masturbation, so I'd feel more comfortable masturbating once in a while.

Any ideas on how to raise my concern tactically?Thanks!

**EDIT as there's clearly a lot of misunderstanding:**  
1. Both 18+yo  
2. If it wasn't for the increased risk of prostate cancer I'd not masturbate for 2 years, if that would make her a little more happy. I personally also liked the idea of 'saving' my sexuality for her, when we get around to it.  
3. She's said she's never masturbated and I'm 99% certain she hasn't. Which is one of the implications she's probably not fond of me doing it.  
4. It was only *implicated* before. I had told her how a friend of mine and I had quit watching porn some time back and she misunderstood this to mean I didn't masturbate anymore, which surfaced later in the conversation, then she said something like ""Well, that's better than watching porn, at least.""

When I met my boyfriend, I thought that maybe we could try it. I gave him oral sex, since we both enjoy it, and I asked him if he could also do it.

He wasn't very enthusiastic, but he did try. I never let him do it for too long, cuz he seemed he was not enjoying anything that was happening at all.

We tried a couple of other times until he confessed that he absolutely hates the smell. At first I worried, thinking that something was wrong with me, but no, is just the regular smell that bothers him. Apparently he has the same problem with his ex as well.

We also had a separate incident, when we were having sex on my period. I was having fun until I looked back and I saw him, facing the window in his right, with the most disgusting face I ever seen, trying to breathe as least as possible. It broke my heart. We stopped immediately and cuddled instead. I wasn't mad that he didn't like it, but it saddened me that he thought he had to keep going against his will. 

Now I guess I'm a little paranoid. I want to receive oral sex but what if he'd just saying he wants to to make me happy? What if he hates it and chooses not to say it? What if he thinks he HAS to do it for me? I'm sure he never liked it in the first place, so him suddenly wanting it so bad is just suspicious to me. And now I feel that if I let him do it I'll be constantly thinking this and not get into it.

Should I let him do it? Should I not? What can I do to mask the smell? Any advice or help?

Her Parents moved to this country as young adults from a more eastern European country and therefore have very old, ""conservative"" views on life. (against gay marriage, a bit xenophobic etc.)

Some time ago she met up with a friend shes known since school, who i have met before and there was nothing odd about him, which makes what happened so hard to understand.

They got drunk and he started touching her and didn't accept any of her ""NO""s at all and raped her that night. After that we reported it to the police and she had to make multiple statements and got a very thorough medical examination. All of this took an entire night.

&amp;#x200B;

The day after we went to visit her parents, she wished for me to come along but to wait in her room at first while she told them about it on her own.

She already had a bad gut feeling about this, because she knew her mother didn't approve of her visiting a male friend and therefore did not tell her that she was visiting him.

(Not like she has to anymore anyways). But as she was telling them about it, she obviously immediately teared up. Instead of consoling her, they started yelling at her.

""I told you, there is no friendship between men and women"", ""This was to be expected"", ""What did you think was going to happen if you meet up with a man alone and drink with them?"".

After firing off these accusations, they started asking some questions about logical next steps, this whole conversation was completely devoid of any emotional support whatsoever. She then told them, that she doesn't need any material support right now but emotional, with which her dad responded ""Well, then leave"", she then left to her room where i was waiting crying. Her parents kept arguing with each other in the room, about who raised her wrong and how they should have been way stricter with her. Maybe then she wouldn't have visited a man alone. We then took a few things and went to my place, we stayed there for a week, in which her parents didn't reach out to her at all.

Then we have had another discussion, where i was asked to come along, because she always feels helpless two versus one against her parents, especially her dad. This was also very disappointing, since they seemed to have not changed their opinion at all, they still think she made a mistake visiting a friend, that she provoked him and that she should have expected that outcome.

They also blame me and question my love for her, because i let her knowingly visit other guys/male friends alone.

I am just in complete shock, never would i have thought its possible for parents to react this way after their child had just told them  what terrible thing happened to them. I knew their opinion on a lot of things, but i always thought no matter what, their child has a higher priority than their outdated outlook on life. Their reaction has made this matter 10 times worse for my girlfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

Considering all of that, my girlfriend still wishes for the relationship to be okay again, she wants the support of her parents. It feels like every discussion we have with them, will go in the wrong direction. Instead of communicating that they are there for her and emotionally support her, they keep discussing those stupid ideas they have about relationships, friendships and it feels like we are discussing politics. This is extremely exhausting for my girlfriend and i HATE that she has to go through this, even without her parents this is already SO DIFFICULT.

I write here because i am frustrated and would appreciate some experience from people here that maybe have had rough times with stubborn parents that are old fashioned.

**TLDR**: My gf has been raped and her parents do not give emotional support (they do provide material support) but blame her and keep lecturing her. They also question our relationship because i let her see male friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Some questions since i have read it in the rules:

My girlfriend was very clear how she expected me to behave in these conversations (her, me and both her parents), she gives me signs if she wants me to defend her or speak my mind, otherwise prefers me to listen, but i have to restrain myself often and would like to say more.

1) Do you think i support her too little with that, should i maybe be less filtered?  


She has had one session with a therapist so far, he has told her that he would be okay to have a session with her and her parents.

2) Do you think that would be an option we should be adamant about (to her parents, her father does not believe in therapists)? Or could it be counterproductive  


3) I'd appreciate any experience with parents with a similar worldview and maybe background, is it worth to just argue with them about those views OVER and OVER again, or do you at one point just have to accept that your parents think it is your fault you were raped? Is that even something you can ignore/forgive?

I (20f) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (20m) for about 2 1/2 years.

A few months ago, my boyfriend confessed to me that he was secretly masturbating in the bathroom. He usually takes really long in there, even if he doesn't do ""other activities"". At first I was fine with that, but then he told me that he watches porn while doing that.

The thing is, I never really watched porn so I have no idea what it's like. But the thought of my boyfriend jerking off to a different woman made me go crazy. This thing was on my mind so long that when my boyfriend asked what's up, I broke down crying and told him that I feel really sad thinking of him jerking off to another woman.

After that, he said he won't do it again.

I masturbate too, but I only use my imagination and I can only do it when thinking of my boyfriend. However, a few days ago, someone different (fictional person) came in my mind while I was doing it and I felt so bad for it because I called my boyfriend out on this and now my mind is doing this too.

I don't even know why I felt so bad about my boyfriend doing it, because he told me that mostly you don't see the womens faces and the porn is only of a certain category. I won't go into detail here but my boyfriend and I do that too, but not that often.

I feel really bad because a) another person came to my mind and b) my boyfriend stopped masturbating because of me and I didn't. He knows that I masturbate too and that I usually only think of him while doing it and he didn't complain.

We’re in a committed relationship and plan on getting married and kids eventually. We’ve always had issues surrounding cheating since both of us have been cheated on in relationships. Ever since that happened to me, I’ve decided that sex is something intimate between 2 people and I felt uncomfortable even watching porn anymore. We used to watch it together but it made me uncomfortable so I stopped watching and my boyfriend stopped too. We had an agreement that we weren’t going to do that anymore. It’s not something we forced on each other, we simply agreed. We stopped for about 2 years. Sometimes I’d ask him “hey did you watch any porn recently” just to kind of test him and he’d always say no, that he doesn’t look at other girls like that, he just thinks of me when he’s jerking off. This was a massive lie. 

We’ve been getting into massive fights recently. I didn’t have a huge reason to distrust him but for whatever reason one night, I snooped through his phone (have not done this since I had really bad trust issues at the beginning of our relationship) and I went on his App Store history to find that he had downloaded several apps intended to sexually video chat with other people like “coco” and “sex actions”. I got so fucking heated. I immediately went and confronted him about cheating and he denied it. After I told him exactly what I found he said “oh I didn’t know you considered that cheating!” (playing dumb). I kept pushing for more information. He got pissed and tried to gaslight me. He brought up guys I hooked up with YEARS ago before I even met him. At first he said he just downloaded the apps just to see what they were. After screaming at him for a couple minutes, he admitted to using them to HAVE GAY VIDEO CHATS WITH OTHER GUYS. He had mentioned for a while that he was fantasizing about me having sex with other men while he watches. When he had these fantasies while we were being intimate, he’d ask me to talk about how hot the guy is, how turned on I was by his dick, etc., but after trying this a few times I told my boyfriend I felt uncomfortable doing this and that I am loyal to him and fantasizing about other guys doesn’t feel right to me. He respected that (or so I thought) and he said he wouldn’t bring it up again or fantasize about this. Now I find all these fucking apps on his phone. He also admitted to going on gay websites anonymously to jerk off to other dicks. He said he’d skip it every time a girl showed up. (And he made sure to tell me that because he knows I’d break up with him if it was a girl but with a guy, maybe I’d be more lenient since I know he’s straight).

I feel fucking betrayed and lied to that he went on these apps and was jerking off to other guys (and maybe girls) behind my back. He’s straight but he says that he’s been uncontrollably turned on by the thought of other guys. I really wonder if he just said that to cover up live video chatting girls because he knows that other guys would make me less mad (but still livid). I know this is going to sound psycho but I was panicking so I went through his YouTube history and found several videos of girls with their tits out that binge watched. When I confronted him about that, he said he was just watching her because she was “weird” and he binged it because he “might’ve fallen asleep to it”. I don’t know if I can buy all of this. This feels like cheating to me. I know some of you guys are totally fine with watching porn and I think that’s fine if you talk about it with your partner and are honest with them but he lied to me for fucking years. I had to fantasize about him and only him for years while he was out here watching other guys dicks and doing god knows fucking what. 

After finding this out the next day, I packed up my bags to leave for good but in the end I couldn’t do it. We have a dog together. We have a future we were supposed to have together. How am I supposed to leave that all behind? 3 years of a relationship is a long, long time. He’s been my best friend and rock through everything. My perception of him has completely changed. 

I guess my question is, do you guys think he’s lying about being turned on by other guys and that it’s a cover up for cheating on me with other girls? Is sexual video chatting with strangers something you would ever be okay with your significant other doing (even if they are straight and doing it with the opposite gender)? How about if they hid that from you for years and one day you find it on their phone? He swore on the holy book that he has never cheated on me, that he loves me, that these were just fantasies and like porn and that they don’t mean anything but I don’t know what to believe anymore.

Sorry for the format and English in advance and for the long post to come... 

Nsfw - contains some sexual description

A little background:

My (29F) bf (30m) and I have been together for 3.5y. moved in about a y ago.

In the beginning of our relationship it was a rollercoaster, lost of ups and downs but we managed to get through it and decided to be stronger and not let little things get in the way 

The sex was great. Like super great. The best I ever had! 
Quality and quantity (very rare to find at least for me)
And so we decided to spice things a little bit and explore some of the swing world.
We are a kinky couple with some fetiches and so it seemed fun! So we joined a platform for swingers and started talking to other couples and it was fun! But we never did the full thing.

Part because we had to move to another city and part because I started to feel a bit uncomfortable with my body (even though men still found my curves sexy). So it went on stand by 

We move almost 2y ago (so 1y apart in the same city, 1y together) and since we moved our sex life just went down.... We have sex maybe, maybe! Once every 2months.
I still give him head because I like it and he still treats me as well. But regarding sex is close to zero.

At first I thought it was because of a growing OCD obsession he has with cleaning and organising finances (even if it's all ok). He takes hours at home on that and goes to bed super late or super tired. And he is really on that cause I've seen it and try to help.

But lately he has started talking about the swing world again. 
I told him I was ok with it but only if we had an healthy sex life ourselves first and not use it to substitute cause that is not being with me. 

The last time he brought it up I finally told me he needs it for his mental state. 
You see, I'm a very tight person (you know where) and my irregular lubrication makes is very hard on him. Like hard hard. He can't control himself and usually last not very long.
We though it might be a medical problem but he has no issues with other stimulation other than penetration.
It has been making a mess in his head cause he was never like that with other women

So having a second couple would help in 3 things:
1 finding if his issue is just with me
2 finding if other guys have the same issue
3 finding a way to solve our problem and have a better sex life

So I agreed

Fast forward to a few hours ago

I had to use his phone to compare some setting on an app to use on my one (Skype). Don't worry we share our phones normally, it's not a big deal.

And for my surprise his Skype is full of conversations with other couples! I was and am shocked... Couldn't sleep a thing.
Even more because he used a new account on which I don't have access

I confronted him and he laughed at me... Refusing to answer my questions

I asked him why he hide it when we agreed on doing it (no answer)
How long (no answer)
Was he using it as a single or for his benefits (said no)
Has he aware of how betrayed I felt (yes)
But no explanation (no answer)

He said it's not a big deal cause he doesn't mind who I speak to! I was even more shocked!!

I asked for access to that account since it concerns both but he denied
Because I still have access to the platform i know it has been going at least since the end of the year. Messages with more than 15d are automatically erased.

I will try to speak to him again today...

I know most of you will say to drop him and that he is cheating... That's the common comments.

I just want to understand why...
And get this out of my chest

I just truly needed to get this off of my chest. Shout it into the wind. Tl;dr I’ve been knocked down over and over and I’m struggling to get
up again. Excuse the winding words, verbal diarrhea just needed to get out. 

Trigger warning for sexual assault and despair. 

I’m paralyzed with fear on the precipice of
just the worst week, month, only 16 days of 2021... as if 2020 wasn’t bad enough. As if I didn’t go through enough. Pinching pennies here and there, trying to eat healthy and trying to mend, physically and mentally. I’ll be outright, I have been on a government subsidy because my previous very strenuous job broke my aching, disease wrecked, forever letting me down body, and I was burnt out mentally, physically, emotionally, spiritually and had to take medical leave. I miss my job more than I have words to say. I’m trying to stay anonymous so I won’t give details, but it was my dream, though low paying, move in a very promising career I had that I had to leave up, and as I have realized now, give up forever. My body, with my very ailments, has let me down one final time. One, big, kick in the butt time. 

So I thought it was the end. I have been on subsidies that pay me barely enough to cover all my monthly needs, but I’ve been making due. I’ve been trying to heal every day. I’ve been going for walks as much as I can. Part of my medication is Methotrexate, so I have to be so careful these days in a hot spot, in a province that is currently under a stay at home order. My roommate has left me alone for this current time, as she is isolating in the lockdown with her long term boyfriend, which I was totally fine with. More on that later. I have been trying to be patient and kind with myself, but an incident occurred this summer that took me back so many steps in my mental health. Something I never thought would happen to me. More in my post history if you are that curious. The person involved ended up stalking me, which resulted in me having contact with the police who were just so demeaning and gross about the whole situation. They made me feel less than human and pitiful and so very, very alone. This happened in November, leading into December, which knocked me back even further. They made remarks about my body and how it would be hard to believe, a ‘he said she said situation’. That there is lacking evidence and they couldn’t help. Communication was over a messaging app that doesn’t need to be connected to a real phone number to be able to access. No real names used, thankfully. But I felt so helpless. And like last weeks trash that got left in the shed with spoiled milk. Bloated and worthless and forgotten. 

I have gained weight since, I know that my appearance has changed. I know I look a hot mess right now with quarantine hair, I get that I need a haircut. I know I look so round and vulnerable with my walking stick at my age, the bags under my eyes giving away that I am so, very, very exhausted. Desperate. I’ve let myself go. I can’t look at myself in the mirror. I can’t be naked. I haven’t brushed my hair in 10 days and I haven’t had a shower in 6. I’m all alone in the apartment with just my cats as company and I thought I would be okay after that, in quarantine for so long, but if I can’t look at myself in the mirror, if I keep the lights off in my bathroom so that I can’t see myself at all, if I avoid all reflective services to the point of tunnel vision, am I actually there at all? Am I actually here, can anybody hear me? Is anybody out there.. 

I’ve been trying to do an online program through a local college that was supposed to be easy, a graduate certificate to look good on a resume. It looks good on a resume, so I’ll be more hireable in the future. Can’t have wasted time, can’t show weakness, can’t have gaps in the resume. I tried to convince myself I was ready to use my mind during the day. Learn something new. I got a grant that covered the exact amount that the course was, given I passed a certain percentage of the courses. I had gone to a competitive program at the same college in years ago, and I was in much better shape, but I worked hard and I and I learned at home and loved every second of it. I had finally found my passion in life. I studied every day, every free moment I had I was on campus. I loved the atmosphere, the teachers and the subject and the involved animals. I thought this certificate would be easy, it’s in HR. I’ve been working a different aspect of customer service since the moment I turned 14, 14 years ago now, up until December of 2019.

The first semester went fine, at first I tried to take 6 courses and was covered for the amount, however 22 days after trying as hard as I could in the mental and physical state I was in, I couldn’t do it. I had to lessen it to 4 and I pulled it off, somehow. I slept and worked, all from my bed. I couldn’t get out of bed, but I could focus my kind enough for 45 minutes to an hour at a time to work on assignments and study, then fell asleep. Cycle repeats. I tried to feed myself but only managed to feed my cats and couldn’t cook for myself. I resorted to quick, cheap meals that I could make in the microwave or the oven, but with absolutely no or extremely minimal effort. That started the weight gain.  But I managed to do it, scraped by the skin of my teeth. 

Semester two I had learned from my previous mistakes and only took 3 courses. I thought I had gotten my groove back, I was succeeding, passing assignments in on time, getting good marks.. and then half way through my semester, July 17, 3 days before my 28th birthday, my ugly fat swollen ass got raped. I relapsed into the darkest of dark pits. I dug my rock bottom even deeper than I ever thought possible. I was ashamed and embarrassed. And oh so alone and an apartment that could no longer possibly be my safe space ever again. That was my couch, I remember the view from below, the dust bunnies lurking in the shadows. The bed I was tied to. Enough with details there, I’ve had to retell it so many times to so many straight but condescending and shaming eyes that I just can’t bring myself to say anymore in that. 

I moved out as quickly as I could, losing a lot of my savings in the progress. I felt I had to, or I would lose my mind completely, that that would be the last shred of sanity I had. I moved in quickly with a roommate I met at a social event in June 2019, she was nice enough then, we had kept up periodically throughout the year and she loved animals and wanted a bigger place to share with someone as living alone was driving her crazy. This is a very long story but now I have come to realize we have developed a very toxic relationship that I will alter as soon as the lease is up and I have enough money saved for another place. I am secretly glad she’s staying with her significant other during this relationship because I don’t have to be cooped up with her and dealing with myself on top of her usual mess and disturbances. But that means I’m alone so it’s really just a neutral thing, so I guess it evens out, but it’s a double edged sword. I am grateful to her at the end of the day, I’ll always be in her debt for taking me in and giving me a safe space, but I cannot be her roommate for much longer. Since she’s left the vivid nightmares of her have stopped, I think that’s a pretty neon red flag. 

With moving and all.., that at the time into August, I failed my semester but I had to jump through hurdles with my doctors and written letters to get a retroactive withdrawal. So I had to repeat the semester again. We’re now October semester start ending in January, and my grants were now loans, pending more letter sending to, in the most detail possible, describe events leading up to necessary withdrawal and blah blah. I should mention at this point that my finances are awful. I know I’ll get shamed for this, but I have no saving and an overwhelming amount of student debts, credit card debts and some other outstanding things. As much as I have penny pinched, I can only pay such a limited amount back each month. My credit is non existent, likely negative. I do have explanations but they all sound like excuses. It’s my fault I got into this mess, I do recognize that, and I own it and am trying to work it out. But over course this is another burden on my already overwhelming anxiety. Repeated the semester, and after multiple extensions I can say I’m almost there. I have currently another two weeks to complete the remainder of the 4 assignments I have left and I think that I am capable. Or I thought .. 

A week ago my old program contacted me about becoming an instructor in the course, 12 hours a week in their practical classes. Through the community grapevine they had heard I was on medical leave, but not why or what my status was, but wanted to know if I was capable. This.. was beyond what I could have hoped for. An honour. I would start in perfect time after my assignments were to be completed, after I had decided to take a break from school for a while, barely suffering through something that I ended up paying money for in the end needs to be done at a time where I can focus, not when I’m clinging on. I thought maybe I could do it? Maybe I could see if it worked? I did the interview, went well. References were awesome. 48 hours ago I get the offer and contemplate the math, I simply won’t get funding if I have a job which is totally fine. But then the math doesn’t quite add up and I would be losing a little money working with the added expenses of gas and parking spots etc. 

36 hours ago my car breaks down, stops dead on the road. I just try not to get hit as I navigate towards the shoulder. Wouldn’t turn on for a while and then my dash lit up like a Christmas tree. Luckily I was around the corner from home and coaxed it at 20 km/hr into the parking lot. Not enough savings to get it towed, let alone pay a mechanic bill that I assume will be ugly. Fine. Try not to panic. 

24 hours ago I had an appointment with my doctor. Does not recommend I use public transit due to high risk and maybe not physically able unless some allowances were made. Two hours later my doctor with a specialization in psychopharmacology calls to let me know I’m definitely not ready for this and he is against it. 

4 hours ago I wrote a heartfelt letter to decline the job and it broke my heart. I understand that I’m likely not ready. But it was something I was finally excited about again. That I thought I could do. But this past week has proved it. He just simply asked how my sleeping habits were and if they were ‘norma’. If I was still afraid to sleep and had nightmares that haunted me in differently variations of my daily life every time I closed my eyes? I didn’t even have to answer. I haven’t slept for more than 3 hours at a time in 4 days. I’ve been avoiding the bed. I’ve been itchy and anxious and getting hives all over my body. I was feeling like I was going through an allergic reaction. These last few days it’s gotten much worse quickly but why.. 

2 hours ago I realized I’m allergic to bed bugs. That the rash is where I snuggle into my blanket. That my skin isn’t that dry but there have been some weird bumps. How I didn’t realize sooner, I don’t know. But.. I’m positive. I’m 100% sure. I’ve called the emergency line of the apartment building, we have an appointment Tuesday. Further instructions to follow but I know it will be hard prepping the apartment and finding a place to stay for my cats for however long they need..

I just don’t know what to do anymore. How many punches can I take? What happens now? How do I handle this? I feel more alone than ever. Like I’m on the precipice of the biggest panic attack I’ve ever had. The cumulation of this.. to be honest I think I’ve made this post so long because right now it’s something that flows naturally and distracts me from the edge. The dark, stormy, lonely edge that is calling my name. I’m afraid of the end, but I know it has come. 

There’s so much more to say and yet I have run out of steam. I haven’t slept.. but how can I sleep when as soon as it’s quiet I hear nothing but my tangled thoughts of horrors and nightmares and the harsh? cold dark truth of my current position. 

Help me. How do I cope. Where do I go. How do I stop the oncoming wave? 

If you’ve come this far, I thank you for your time. For walking in my shoes for a moment, for carrying the burden a short while. Please, stay safe out there.

TW for mentions of s. assault (not sure if it counts...) and minor touching on nsfw topics

To start, I know the title doesn’t do me amazing justice, but please hear me out: I have been friends with P (17f) for 9ish years and K (16f) for about 7. They are my two best and only friends in the whole world and I love them more than anything. However, I constantly feel unwanted by them or like I'm only there when they need someone as a last resort.

P has always been in and out of my life since she’s very popular and social, but she and I have hardly have a hard time making up for lost time. She was always friends with girls who would bully more or that I generally just didn't like because I had a bad feeling about them (I was always right in the end about them), and it bothered me a lot as a kid because I didn't have many friends to turn to. Now, she’s recently gotten a boyfriend (16), and spends a lot more time with him as well as a friend who lives about 3 hours away (18). Her boyfriend has since made her cut off ties from some more toxic friends, though some linger or pass in and out on occasion. 

One friend (16 f) of hers has caused me a considerable amount of trauma that I recently came out to P and K about. This occurred when we were about 7-8, and I was at this girls house on a play date. It was innocent and all until she brought me to a kind of cupboard under her staircase (think harry potter) where we started drawing and kept playing. However, she asked me to play a game no one could know about, and me being excited I have a new friend, agreed to do as she asked. She asked me to take off my pants and underwear and...it was a strange ordeal because I didn't yet understand why it was happening or what to do, so I let her poke and prod at me among other things. She asked me if I wanted to reciprocate but I declined. Fast forward 8 years and I come clean to both my friends after that girl recently came out at bi—it brought a lot of unresolved questions back and I ultimately wasn't comfortable with P being friends with her. P is still friends if not BETTER friends with the girl now than ever. K supports me and no longer brings the girl up on conversation for my sake of sanity while I battle my unearthed questions.

Moving on to K, she has been a thorn in my side for a few years now, more than ever these last two years. She's strong-minded, heavily opinionated, and extremely conservative in the traditional ways. We constantly butt heads but love each other like sisters, but she puts me down a lot about school grades and my own opinions. She can be snippy and flakey, basically ignoring me for hours or days on end when I text her but responding to my Instagram dms instantaneously. K sees me as the most mature of all of her friends and thus only strikes up conversations about politics or other ‘controversial news’ with me when we see each other, or ignores me completely to watch tik toks. She puts me down on grades by one-upping me and dismissing my accomplishments to further prove she is a better, smarter student and friend.

Now here is where the two of the stopped being good friends. P convinced K and I (13s and 14 at the time) to meet up with a guy she met online (17), and we did. It went smoothly and no one was kidnapped or anything. However, K broke down and confessed to her mom what we had done, shoveling all the blame onto P. This led to an avalanche of problems such as K’s mom exploding on my mom and P’s mom in front of a group of people while out to dinner...P and K didn't talk for a long time and I was stuck in the middle. To this day, K does not hang out actively with P unless I bridge the gap.

However, I started to learn that K and P have a deeper relationship than I thought in that—P has told (on accident) K about sexual situations P has had with her boyfriend. At first when they both admitted it to me, I wasn't offended and laughed along at how they thought I was going to judge P for being a little...provocative the first time she hung out with her now bf. But later on that night, I felt a sudden hollowness about how disconnected I am from my friends. I began to realize that I'm the only one who ever reaches out to make plans, and I'm the only one ever left out from plans they make with a bigger group. I've always been ostracized and made fun of for my interests by them but when they start to pick up on those interests, it's suddenly cool because tiktok said it was. Nowadays P and K hardly refer to me as their best friend, and K recently changed her Instagram pfp to a picture of her and another one of her friends...and it hurt me a little inside. They’ve always been close and I never would want to get in the way, but it has been 4 months since I've hung out with K (safely), and she only ever texts me for homework answers. She's been seeing this other friend frequently while also saying she misses me...P also says the same thing despite having recently been home for 2 weeks doing nothing because her boyfriend was grounded.

All in all, I'm feeling very lonely and disconnected from my two only friends. I have friends in school and online friends give me daily support, but it isn't the same. I feel selfish and stupid for feeling almost jealous of how they can move on with their lives while I'm left in the dust despite my now diminishing efforts to see them. The pandemic isn't even an excuse because they had both been gallivanting around all year and saw their fair share of people except for me...

Do you guys think I'm being too dramatic and overly possessive of them? I wouldn't want to hinder them from having other relationships, but I would like to at least know if they want to continue our friendship or not.

We are a fan of roleplaying and stuff so roleplaying while horny over texts was not a good idea. He likes rough s3x, I like bound s3x and being told what to do and stuff. So we were just sending texts like he does something then I do something like: Me: *takes all of my clothes off*. And then Him: I'm gonna f*ck you so good baby girl. And all of that stuff.

So we got into a roleplay where I was just sucking his d!ck, ramming his d!ck up my pu55y and s3xual stuff. All of this was my idea, I'll admit to that.

Then because I was complaining that my internet worked, my dad needed my phone. I didn't change accounts so he was still texting me, thinking I had my phone. Suddenly a message popped up from him.

She was never educated about sex through school or our mother. I also assist my mother in monitoring my sister's cell phone and social media which she never showed any curiosity towards the subject. I'm close to my sister but my brother has always kept to himself so they don't have that close of a relationship that could've lead to this type of situation as well.

My little sister confessed to me recently that our brother brought her into his room to have a sex talk two years ago. But this ""sex talk"" only consisted of sexual drive, masturbation, and various sex toys. Afterwards he presented to her a sex toy asking if she wanted to use it which she declined. Some time that same day he wrestled with her and groped her breasts and butt. I spoke to my brother later for his side of the story and it matched what I was told. Both siblings confirmed that this happened once and nothing transpired afterwards. I told my mom later on and we both sat down with my sister to talk about her feelings, the situations, and all that. We ensured my sister that we believe her and gave her the emotional support she needed.

So far it's been decided that my brother will move out by the end of February the reason being that he doesn't have enough money to move out on his own right now. Once that happens both siblings will get a therapist. I'm not comfortable with this delay but for now both my mother and I are working from home and been keeping both siblings away from each other; if not, monitoring them when together (e.g, the kitchen).

There are several things bothering me:

1. He's moving out and will see a therapist but isn't going to be reported. What happened was a one-time thing but what happens if this occurs again? And to a stranger? What can I do to ensure this never happens again?
2. Today my mother told me she wants to keep their siblings relationship going which I questioned. She told me to ""understand from a mother's perspective"". She believes that they're still blood and need to keep that bond. During Christmas and New Years my sister did ask if he could join us for the gift unwrapping and dinner so I think she's comfortable being around him still. But she's still a kid and I don't know if I should take her judgement for granted?
3. I know CPS is an option but how extreme are their procedures?

Mentions assault and drinking. Also, i’m on mobile, sorry for any format weirdness.

The problem started on January 1st, I won’t go into too much detail but one of my best friends was totally blacked out and ended up hooking up with our really close guy friend. I was unaware of how drunk he was at the time as to me he seemed completely sober. 

I was genuinely appalled by his actions, again i was under the assumption she was blackout and he was not. The situation brought up a lot of bad feelings and memories from when i had gotten assaulted a few years prior. Additionally from a situation that had happened between us where i was very drunk at the time but sobered up and stopped it. I’ll admit i didn’t know how to handle it so I was angry. It didn’t help that the next day he completely threw her under the bus saying “well she started” I was just very angry because I felt like i could no longer trust him and to avoid lashing out further I said i didn’t really want to speak to him until I had processed what was going on in my head, and until i would feel comfortable being around him again. 

For the rest of the month I realized I had overreacted and it truly didn’t involve me, I was my friends shoulder to cry on when she was feeling confused and scared about the situation. She admitted to me he said things that he then went back on after he said he didn’t remember much, but i didn’t find out about that until later.

A few days ago I texted him an apology and said I wanted to talk and apologize in person and try to explain why i reacted like I did. Last night he texted me after I had a few drinks and i could tell he had been drinking so I told him i wasn’t mad or anything but id like to talk about it sober. He then started getting angry saying i was mad about nothing and it didn’t even involve me. So i apologized again and said that i should’ve heard him out and i overreacted. He continued to get angry and defensive. 

He kept pushing me, so i told him things from my perspective and that there were things that he said/did when he went to talk to my other friend that I was totally unaware of until recently, and then there were things that contradicted one or more things he did. But overall I said i didn’t have to whole story about how things happened until more recently. He kept getting angry and at this point I got angry.

What i said was mean, but it’s how i was feeling. I told him that his actions brought up trauma from my assault (which he knew about) and made me not want to be around him, it put  what happened between us in new light and made me start thinking about what if i wasn’t able to sober up and it scared me and I wanted my space. He continued to just say “it had nothing to do with you though” and just generally being aggressive. That was the final straw and it just hurt, to me it felt like he was saying that it didn’t matter that I was traumatized he still expected me to act like his friend and like everything was fine and to get over it.

At this point to told him to text me when he was sober and that he was acting like a child who can’t deal with his emotions and lashes out when he’s drinking and ended it there. He texted me a few more times in rapid succession but i didn’t look. I was done. 

Maybe i was in the wrong and I should just get over it, my other friend forgave him and they still hang out. Which let me add, i’m fine with. I respect her and her decisions and she understands that I would feel very uncomfortable around him and why i didn’t want to speak to him. At this point though, with him lashing out I’m not even sure the friendship is worth saving. I feel like i’ve seen yet another side of him where he doesn’t want to have to confront his own actions or the consequences of them so he doesn’t care about why i’m upset. My other friend is a very trusting and non-confrontational person and just forgave him as long as their friendship wouldn’t be weird after, so he didn’t really have to think about his actions.

  So I've been seeing this girl for like 2 weeks now, and we just started having sex about a week ago. The first few times were decent, pretty vanilla and nothing to write home about, but yesterday it was like a switch flipped in her, which is great but also took me by surprise, big time.

   I'm really into dirty talk and general debauchery during sex, but with a new partner I keep it to a minimum at first just to test the waters and ease into that kinda stuff. Basically just to make sure they're comfortable enough with me to let loose. 

  So yesterday, I was fucking her in the good ol' missionary position, and could feel that I was gonna cum very soon. I pulled out with impeccable timing, as per-usual, and blew one of my biggest loads to-date all over her stomach. It was so much that I was like ""oh fuck my bad"", and then she looks  me in the eye, looks at the cum, and then rubs it all over herself and licks her fingers after. This is when I said ""Jesus Christ I fucking love you"", cuz I mean c'mon that shits fire.  Anyways, I could tell she was kinda like ""uhh wtf dude"" and sorta took it literally.

I'm worried it's gonna scare her off because she hasn't been texting as much now. I'm very into her and want this to work out and for us to be a thing, but of course haven't fallen in love yet. It's usually at least a few months before I throw that word around literally.

I've changed a few details and created a throwaway to stay anonymized. This happened between my cop friend and gf.

It has seemed to me for a while that my cop friend has had a thing for my gf. Not sure if it's because she's the only attractive/fit woman in his life or what but he's had some predatory like behavior with her. He is single. He always seems to be near her when we hang out as friends and always tries to basically do my job by ""caring"" about her. When I say caring I mean when we go out to drink he asks if she's okay and asks if she got home safe. In the past he would try to hang out with just her and not invite me or my friends. My gf never felt comfortable with that. He would ask her to watch movies in his car, get taco Tuesday, or to go to the beach with just him. He was getting so insistent with this that it made my gf and I very uncomfortable so my gf had to be straight up with him and tell him to back off a bit and respect the boundaries. What I would find weird is why he would always try to hang out specifically with my gf and not me or ask any of my other friends.

So this past weekend we were celebrating my birthday and had a few drinks. It was my gf, my cop friend, 2 other friends (25m), and I. I've had this group of friends since freshman year of college. My friends are all single and I am the only one with a gf. We got pretty drunk but nothing too crazy. We then proceeded to watch a tv show at my friends place. My gf was pretty intoxicated so she went straight to the couch to lay down where my cop friend followed. Someone handed my gf a blanket which was then also shared with my cop friend.

A few minutes into the show my gf texts me saying that my cop friend was basically groping her thighs and her top vaginal area. I was shocked and told her to switch spots with me(I was sitting on a separate chair right next to the couch). We ordered pizza and moved away for the rest of the night.

I want to say that I fully trust my gf who I have been with for a long time(5+ years). I do not think she is lying or over-exaggerating in the slightest. She is not the type of person to just make things up like this and cause drama. I believe she was in denial at first about what was happening. He was attempting to fondle her under the blanket. My gf said that at first she didn't want to believe it so she just moved to another uncomfortable chair. My cop friend kept insisting to her ""aren't you cold?"" so after a while she moved back to the couch because the other chair was uncomfortable. My gf seems to have been in denial at first and didn't want to make a big deal out of it so she moved back to the couch. That's when he actually full on assaulted her. She was sitting legs closed, butt facing him and he tried grabbing over her hips but then underneath her legs. After this is when she texted me and we switched spots.

Later when we all got home my gf texted him saying she knows we were drunk but some boundaries were crossed. I don't think she was specific enough with him. He basically responded saying ""I'm still drunk. I do get it and I'm sorry for crossing any boundaries."" He said that it was not his intention and that he was just highly intoxicated. My gf responded telling him not to do that again and that she would look the other way because she doesn't want to cause any problems. I have talked to her and I do not want to just look the other way and ignore this. His behavior has gotten worse and I feel like he would probably do this again. I'm not comfortable drinking around him honestly.

My gf and I have felt pretty disgusted at him for this. I've felt nauseous and sick to my stomach just thinking about it. As a cop I feel that he should definitely know better. I don't think the alcohol is any excuse for this as he was still able to drive home that night. We weren't even that messed up. To me it seems that he was testing the boundaries to see how far he could go. My gf and I shouldn't have to worry about this happening. We shouldn't have to police his actions and shouldn't have to prevent this from happening. He should have the self control to not do these things regardless of whether he is drunk or not.

I don't want this to ever happen again. I feel that I should talk to him about this but I'm not really sure how to word it. I don't really want to lose him as a friend as I don't have much friends and one of my other friends is moving far away. Idk how to continue our relationship with him though. I'm not confident he will stop, in fact I think it can only get worse from here. He's never done something this bad before. I don't think I can accept anything other than a complete apology and a reassurance that he will stop this behavior. Even then I would need to see that he follows through on that and I still wouldn't trust him. I've thought about reaching out to one of my friends to see what he thinks but I would probably do that after I hear my cop friends response. I'm not one to cause drama and cut people out of my life like that but my cop friend has left me with little options here. I have a feeling that my cop friend will try to say that he doesn't remember anything because he was drunk.

So what should I do wise strangers of the internet?

My phone was upstairs charging. 

We have each other on our phones fingerprint and know the passwords because we don’t care if we use each others phone. So I took a pic of my game and went to send it to the group chat with our friends in it and I saw 2 pics of naked girls with a Snapchat caption on it.

Nope. He jumps off the workout machine and snatches the phone out of my hand acting all weird. Now in my head I’m like “wtf why is he so suspicious??” so I ask him why are you acting like that?? And he just keeps saying its embarrassing! 

We have a relationship where porn is whatever. I don’t care about the material to enjoy himself to. I think his weird reaction is what is making me kinda upset. After that I was thinking “is he paying for porn pics from girls or something? Is there something to hide?” He showed me the pics from a subreddit dedicated to Snapchat porn pics (there’s a subreddit for everything apparently...). He said he was embarrassed and knew it looked really suspicious which is why he freaked a bit.

I came home from trade school, and i see it lying in the side yard. It was covered and blood, so I was just gonna throw it on it woods. Got a shovel and started to pick it up when it moved, just enough to be alive. But there was no way it was making it, with the bite wounds and all. 

My dad has a pistol, a .40 Springfield. I went in and got it so I could put it out of its misery. It was either that or let the dogs play with it, which would be inhumane.

Apparently, he was talking to another girl while he was talking to Hannah and she was not happy about it and he was freaking out bc he didn't know what she was going to do. Long story short she gets over it and keeps talking to Ant. I became really close with his friend chase. I was just facetiming these guys all the time just talking about random stuff honestly. But every day some shit went down. Where either Ant would start an argument about the fact that Hannah is hanging out with guys who buy her drinks and ""being a hoe"". Or Hannah would start an argument asking for his social media passwords, even though he doesn't have hers. He also loves to bring up the fact that she has 33 bodies when they are arguing but when they are together he says it doesn't matter. Ant is always talking to girls being a little too friendly in my opinion, but if Hannah is around he is really quiet.

Now stuff like this is constantly happening and what's concerning about it is that they've only been dating each other for about a month! It feels like it's been toxic since the day they met honestly. But last night we were all on ft together and Ant is like talking about how much he LOVES this girl and wants to marry her and not even 30 minutes ago he was on live basically saying she is ""for the streets"" and let's not even talk about how he literally slept with another girl last week.

We'll get to that in a second. 

First off, my mom is amazing. She's raised me better than I think anyone would have been able to, and she lives by the motto that because I'm an adult, my space is my space and she doesn't judge me for how bad my depression gets, and in tandem, so does my apartment. It's not dirty, just messy, and a lot of... ahem, *personal items* were laying around the apartment. For context, I live alone, currently single. 

It is 1:30pm and I'm on my way to work. I left my place early in order to pick up some food on the way since I work in a prison and the food there is just ick. So I'm driving along when suddenly something dawns on me.

*I've left my flat iron on.* It's probably sitting on my bathroom sink, next to a couple of bottles of soap and a coffee mug from when I was getting ready. Sooooo I call my mom because we agreed that she would have a key in case of an emergency. Today was the day! But *oh fuck*, I've left my sex toys ALL OVER THE FUCKING APARTMENT. Literally, I had washed them the night before and left them on my bathroom sink countertop because I was too lazy to put them in the basket beneath my sink. 

Not only that, but my fire alarm is also disconnected because I'm an idiot and made steak on a too hot cast iron pan last night. I'm *definitely* not calling maintenance on this one.

I'm not sure if that's required, but I did it just incase. I also apologize for such a long post, but I couldn't find a way to make it shorter without leaving out any background information and key details.**

Hello, I am new to reddit and this is my first post and I was hoping you guys could offer me some advice. There's a lot to unpack here but I'll start simple. I'm 19 years old (F19), and I'm currently in my first relationship with my boyfriend (M20) and we have been together for 11 months. We have a history of arguing a lot where we both dealt with things in an unhealthy way and said toxic things to each other, and we were able to get through that phase of constantly arguing and eventually came up with a somewhat better approach to issues and concerns we have in our relationship. 

Some background information about me, I struggle with anxiety and I overthink way too much, and it has affected our relationship badly. Whenever we argue, I overthink a lot and create scenarios that are not real and only exist in my head, but to me they are hypothetical and 'what if' scenarios, and I use those scenarios to help me understand certain things, and to also get reassurance from him. He's told me before that he does not want to deal with my anxiety and overthinking at all, but I would always deal with him whenever he feels apathetic and careless to everyone, especially me, or whenever he gets 'bad.' However, now whenever I need reassurance, I always say to him if I could ask him a question for reassurance, and he'd always give it to me. 

Our first 'real fight' was 6/7 months into our relationship, where we were discussing the topic of porn, and him following/liking other women's post in which they were nearly naked and posting sexual content. Long story short, I felt hurt, uncomfortable, and disrespected that he did these things. This was my first attempt at communicating a serious matter, and I did it horribly because it was something I was new to and have always had trouble being vocal about my emotions. I asked him why did he watch porn and he said 'it's just a guy thing, it doesn't mean anything.' I told him that I considered it cheating, because he was thinking about other women, and that if he didn't want to stop watching porn, I would leave the relationship. When I was telling him how I felt, I didn't see it as an ultimatum at first, and I didn't realize it until he pointed it out, and he told me that I was manipulating him and controlling him into doing what I wanted. That truly wasn't my intention, I just wanted to tell him how it made me feel and that I would like my feelings to be considered when he made his own decisions. After this argument, he still continued to watch porn. He stopped a couple months later, but the reason he said he would try to stop is because he couldn't stay aroused during sex and masturbating to porn often was affecting it. I asked him again why he watched porn videos and he confessed that he would fantasize about other women and the way he acted when we first talked about it was because he was disgusted with himself and didn't want to admit it and took it out on me.  He currently does not watch porn anymore because he finally realized the affect it had on me. 

Before I go on, prior to the argument we had tonight, I asked him for reassurance because I was overthinking about him watching porn, and so I asked him if he still did and he said no and that was it. Tonight during our other argument, I asked him about a scenario and hypothetical situation, due to my overthinking. I have told him before that this is my way of understanding his view of things, and understanding things in general, but he said 'It's clear to see you're just gonna keep going with the scenarios so I'm just gonna ignore you now,' and he has always chosen to ignore me whenever I brought up these scenarios. I've always let it go because it would be no use to try to get him to talk about it with me, so I got fed up our conversation went like this: 

Me: ""Why do you hate when I overthink and give you scenarios I'm overthinking about? I know they’re a personal battle I have to deal with, but why do you have to make it harder for me to deal with and like you don’t care at all?""

Him: ""I don't understand them and doesn't see the point"" \[This is him being apathetic, like how I mentioned above. He's always been way before we've met.\]

Me: ""Just because you feel that way doesn’t mean you have to ignore the fact that I'm obviously going through something and you’re not making it any better. **Isn’t your significant other supposed to be the person who supports you through things like this?** Why do you get all my love for you, even when you get ‘bad’, but you don’t want to deal with my anxiety and my overthinking, as you’ve said before?"" \[The bolded part, I would like to point out that I do not expect my partner to be there for me all of the time. I understand he has things he's going through that he does not tell me and does not have to tell me. And I also do not expect him or depend on him to 'fix me' or make me feel better. What I mean is that I think your significant other should be the one person who should support you and at least try to help you through difficult times and for me, my invasive thoughts. All I'm really asking from him, is his support.\]

Him: ""I'm a shitty person. What do you want from me?""

Me: ""When you love someone, *you're supposed to love all of them*. Do you love me unconditionally, or only on your terms?"" \[I would like to add, the italicized part is my opinion of love and I am not trying to convince anyone that this is the way they should think too. Feel free to share your opinions, I would love to hear.\]

Him: ""I don't know. Well I don't love all of you thats for sure. I dont like how you control whether or not i watch porn. If i wanna watch it i should be able to. I understand where you're coming from but at the same time you cant do that to me.""

I apologize it took so long to get to the point, but I didn't know how to shorten it without leaving our any important details. Do you think you can truly love someone if you don't love all of them? I love my boyfriend, all of him, all the good parts and even the bad because I know his 'bad qualities' isn't who he is, it's a part of him. But he does not want to deal with my anxiety and overthinking when it comes down to me trying to understand the situation with my scenarios or when I simply just need reassurance, which I always ask him for. I am aware that my communication with him at the time could have been improved and that there are a loooot more things I need to work on, but if any of you guys have any advice to offer about ***anything*** related to this post, I would tremendously appreciate you.",0,0,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,nsfw,"My (F19) boyfriend (M20) says he doesn't love all of me, does this mean he doesn't truly love me?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/l56ge4/my_f19_boyfriend_m20_says_he_doesnt_love_all_of/,promo_adult_nsfw,20.5

Same thing would start over the next month.

I started taking the pill again this week on Sunday. Will I need a backup method? Am I okay to be sexually active? I really don’t know, and I cannot stress how much I don’t want to have kids right now.

I posted this in u/birthcontrol, but could use some tips on how to stop overthinking this and worrying. I’m not being pressured to sleep with him at all.

Basically, I matched with this girl(20) on Tinder about 6-7 mo. ago and we texted on and off briefly for a bit(mostly just sexting and pictures but never met in person). The last time we spoke was right before she got into a serious relationship, so we haven't spoke since. 

Skip to last week, she messages me on Instagram out of nowhere. After two or three messages she starts telling me about her breakup and I was trying to be kind of sympathetic and being nice ofc and then we started texting. A little later after some texting she says something like ""show me your dick"" and so then we exchanged photos again. Then she says that she's too upset still to talk about that stuff. I said okay, no big deal I'm totally okay with that, and then I went to sleep shortly after(for work). 

The following morning I text her gm and she instantly starts telling me how sad she is and she's nonstop crying abt the breakup. I once again tried to show sympathy and be there for her, but she didn't stop. I eventually told her that I'm sorry for your breakup but the stranger from the internet(me) isn't really the person to reach out to abt this, as we aren't anywhere close to friends and only sext, and I'd still like to talk to her but I can't consul her thru this. She then calls me a total dickhead because she has no one else to talk to and I was in the middle of typing out my explanation of why I don't really feel comfortable or want to talk about it being honest and then I realized she blocked my number, and then on every social media platform as well.

I would say I'm actually pretty terrible at sex. I don't last long, it can range from a few minutes if I'm lucky to 20 seconds if I'm unlucky (And I'm unlucky pretty frequently). And I'm packing smaller than normal ""equipment"" so the sex during that time frame isn't anything mind blowing. Knowing this is a major drain on my self confidence and I think it's effecting me in a really negative way.

A little backstory on my situation. I met my first girlfriend at 22, lost my virginity to her, and we dated till I was 24. I know she was very unsatisfied with our sex life during that time (she told me as much, albeit gently) but she had her own issues relating to sex so it wasn't a deal breaker to her. I would try going down on her but she didn't seem to enjoy that either, and wouldn't want me to do it for long. So I never got the ""practice"" to be skilled at it.

We broke up around 2 years ago, and I initially didn't date for a while because I was sad about the breakup. But lately I've been realizing I'm scared to engage women romantically. Even the best case scenario of meeting someone I really hit things off with is terrifying because I know how awkward things will be when sex eventually comes up and it's over in a minute. It's a real deterant from even asking a woman out for dinner because I'm afraid of thing becoming intimate.

And I can feel this fear making me awkward. I now respond to flirting like a deer in headlights. I freeze up, start giving one word responses, keep shifting out of eye contact.

I would bend completely to his will despite being cheated on, lied to, hit, and manipulated. That’s how abuse is, unfortunately. 

So when S and I had somewhat established a little relationship (I use the term relationship loosely) and F said that he wanted me back after breaking up with me for like a month, I ran to his side, leaving S. I know that’s not a good thing, but I was being abused. And I made it clear to S that we weren’t in a relationship. 

A few months go by and I’m finally able to get out of F’s clutches and immediately S is on me. He wants to hang out all the time, travel together, live together, etc and this whole time I thought we were poly, because he had a plethora of dating apps on his phone that he regularly used and was also talking to another girl. 

But then I downloaded tinder. 

He freaked out. 

I had no clue why!! He was talking to other people, why couldn’t I? I wanted to go on a date with my (now current) partner! He made me ask to be poly and then for months acted as though I was hurting him intentionally. 

I have troubles with sex because of past experiences, so my libido is basically nonexistent. He knew this very well. And yet, when I suddenly didn’t want to have sex with him, I was doing it on purpose to hurt him!! I didn’t understand the logic, but he used that and pressured me into sex and sexual encounters nearly everyday. 

He tried to have sex on dates and he couldn’t keep it up, to which he told me he only enjoyed it with me, even though he KNOWS I can’t fulfill his aggressive libido. 

I ended up getting closer with my dear and we had sex. I felt comfortable and not pressured to do anything and it just felt right. 

S didn’t take this very well at all. It was like I had betrayed him because I never wanted to have sex with him. All the pressure was so overwhelming. I could feel how badly he wanted me to ask to be monogamous with him. He asked about it once and I said I didn’t want it. He just expected me to bend to his will because it was what he wanted. It caused both of us a lot of anxiety for different reasons. 

I thought he was going to hurt himself and he just hated that I enjoyed the presence of someone else. He ended up asking me to marry him, to which I said I’m never getting married, I hate marriage, and then he changed it to a “love celebration” so that when we “went on our honeymoon” it would feel like a real honeymoon. 

Just totally disregarding all of my wants and needs, he freaked out at me and I felt like he was going to hurt me. I broke up with him and decided that I didn’t want to text him because I really just didn’t want to have any interactions with him. He responded to that with massive texts telling me how terrible of a person I was for trying to heal and understand what was happening on my own. S just couldn’t handle that I didn’t owe him anything and that I could heal in the way that’s best for me. 

I know that makes me sound like a dick, but honestly, I was just so done. 

I couldn’t handle how MUCH he was. He still infects my brain and whenever I think about him my skin crawls. I feel like I always have to watch out for him, even if he’s not anywhere near here anymore. 

I really just would love some advice on how to get him out of my head. It’s been a couple of months and I don’t want to be thinking of him anymore, he just makes me so uncomfortable. I want to feel safe again. I just always hear how inconsiderate I am despite YEARS of compromise on my part. When he broke up with me, I accepted it, when he wanted anything, I just went with it, when he had a new interest, I learned about it. He couldn’t even tell me my birthday if I had asked. 

Honestly just typing this all was pretty helpful for me, sorry if it seems weird and not well written, I’m really tired and just needed to get this off my chest. 

Thank you for anything, I’m going to bed.

It first happened 16 years ago so the details are a little fuzzy, most I can remember is I had to get up and go ask my dad a question about something that was going to happen the following morning. My room is located at the top of the stairs and when I was younger I liked to jump down the first say 7 or so stairs because I was a rebel or something. At the bottom of those stairs is a landing where the path then splits, going forward toward the office and bathroom or toward the front door. Now most of the time the stairs toward the garage are full of extra boxes (my dads a bit of a hoarder) so you have to sort of traverse your way down the stairs. I normally put my hand on the railing lean forward and use the railing to skip a few steps. This motion allows me to get a clear view of who is in the office so as soon as I lean onto the railing. This fateful night happened to be my dad masturbating. Now you might say why didn't your dad at least close the door before beating his meat. Well as stated before my dad is a bit of a hoarder so the office is full of paper and the clutter makes it so that the doors will not close. This clutter however means that I could not actually see his johnson but me being an eight year old I had no idea what he was doing... Until I saw what was on the computer. The fuzzy memory I have of it is just some lady completely naked pointing at her crotch.

Now I wish it ended there, that it could've just been a memory I keep repressed and rarely think about. Unfortunately something similar happened tonight. I'm 24 now but I live at home because I found a job close by and uhh covid. Honestly might try to find a place as I don't know how to ease the tension that was brought on by this but I digress. I had to pee pretty badly but my sister was using the upstairs one so downstairs I went. As I put my hand on the railing I was taken back to my childhood memory as I saw my dad look at me and then frantically reposition. Now I was pretty committed to going to the bathroom so I averted my eyes and kept on walking. As soon as I finished using the facilities I suddenly realized I had to walk past him again to get back up the stairs. I hesitated for a moment opening up the door then went for it. Luckily he had left the office and went to the kitchen giving me a clean escape to my room. Now I just have to ease the tension since we have a small family gathering tomorrow for my sister's birthday.

Last night was my first time. Wasn't really the sex sex type, but I can't stop thinking about something that bothers me. 

That boy and me were having a make out while our nude bodies were all over each other. At a point we were heavy grinding, while I was on top of him. We touched here and there, our hands touched our genetails, and then we decided to try and have sex. He put on the condom and then we were trying and touching etc. 

So my question is, if there was precum (which is possible since I'm not sure if the wetness was from me only), could something have happened because at a point he and I inserted a finger in me after having touched his member.

For context I live in a high school dorm of all guys, and naturally we hang out a ton in each other’s rooms. That year my room was the central hang out zone and often I would let my friends chill out there when I had to leave real quick. One day I was in there with 2 friends and I had to go shower (I changed by putting the towel over me first and then unclothing) and I let my friends stay in my room while I was gone. Upon my return I kicked them both out cause it’s a lot more awkward getting changed from a towel to clothes, and I also wanted some alone time. Maybe I’m weird but when I’m alone in my room I like to just chill naked, idk it’s just more comfortable. 

Anyway this is the juicy part, so I’m kicked back in my recliner, butt naked and watching YouTube, when all of a sudden a hand emerges from my closet with a phone that’s recording. Following the hand and grinning mischievously is one of my dumbshit friends (not one of the two who were in there previously, apparently this guy had been hiding in my closet for over an hour playing brawl stars and waiting for the perfect moment to strike). Naturally I start freaking the fuck out and jump up from my recliner, using my laptop to cover my crotch as it was the only thing in close proximity to me. This whole time I’m screaming every profanity in my vocabulary at this dude to get tf out, but he won’t listen and keeps recording. I attempt to grab a pair of underwear, but I’m only able to swap them out with the laptop to cover my crotch, and don’t actually get the chance to put them on. I then grab this guy’s phone with one hand and attempt to wrestle it away, while elbowing him and covering my crotch with my underwear with the other hand. Naturally we’re making a lot of noise and I’m still screaming at him, and the two friends that I had just kicked out overhead from the hallway and are banging on the door wondering what kind of demon magically spawned in my room that caused me to make such a racket. Then to make matters worse the house advisor on the floor, a middle-aged female history teacher, hears the racket and decides to get involved, using her master key to unlock my door. Upon opening it she is graced with the sight of my naked body, only obstructed by a pair of underpants that I’m loosely holding over my crotch, in a full out wrestling match with this other dude, screaming my ass off. She screams so loud that the entire dorm heard her, and slams the door immediately. To make matters worse her seven year old son decided to come with her while she was on dorm duty, but thank god he was standing somewhat behind her and was shielded from the worst of it. After this my friend had a big OH SHIT moment and he got into some pretty serious trouble. But he was still my friend and so i didn’t mention the recording phone to the house advisor, cause that had grounds for some serious cp allegations and no one needed that, he ended up deleting the video anyway. But to top it all off this house advisor became my history teacher the next year, and I don’t think either of us ever fully recovered from the awkwardness.

Everything is great, we get along, have similar interests and generally are happy with each other. However, for the past couple of months, my girlfriend and I have had sex about 3 times. There are times when we try but for the life of me, I find it hard to maintain an erection long enough to get the condom on, which I believe it the biggest failing in our relationship. To give credit to my girlfriend, she always tries, she has tried a few different ways to spice things up but more often than not, I'm unable to do anything about it. We had previously discussed that we should be maybe doing something sexual at least 2/3 times a week. I tell her that it's not her and I'm attracted to her but she obviously might have an issue believing it when I can't show her how. When we initially moved in together last February, the first two/ three weeks was great, after that the issue of impotence started. 

I'm at a loss of what to do or where to go about this. I was thinking of going to the doctor but I think during these times, there are bigger issues than mine. I don't know if it's anything medical based or is it more likely that it is all in my head. If it is in my head, do I need to go see a therapist?

So Reddit, what do I do? She is my first girlfriend and my only sexual partner, so I don't know any difference. I have had too many conversations with my girlfriend about this and I'm starting to think that if things don't change for the better, the relationship might take a turn for the worse.

Apologies for the length of this, but I felt that some backstory was needed just so you can understand where I am right now.

I've been together with my boyfriend for 5 months. We live in Northern Europe, I'm originally from the neighboring country, but moved here about 2,5 years ago in order to attend a folk high school (basically a school with a lot of creative programs where you don't get grades). I really enjoyed my time there and having the opportunity to explore my chosen field and work on different creative projects, and decided to return for a second year. 

That was when I met my now-boyfriend, as we lived together in a shared house/dormitory together with seven other people. We started hitting it off romantically at the very end of the school year, going on drunken late-night and early morning adventures visiting sheep and climbing fortresses, and cuddling and watching movies in the evenings, basically acting as a couple. Throughout the summer we spent most evenings watching movies and hanging out on Skype, and often checked in on each other during the day, taking walks together, chatting while cooking dinner and things like that. Due to travel regulations between the two countries we were only able to meet up twice, as I had to quarantine for 10 days at home after having visited him. 

At that point we talked about the possibility of us trying out a relationship if I ended up moving back; for a time he had said that was what he wanted and what he thought would happen. Then very suddenly, on the last day of my second visit I asked him where we stood right now, to which he said that he didn't love me, didn't think it was a given that we were going to marry someday (??), wasn't sure about what he wanted and that it might be for the best if we just stopped talking altogether. It was all very confusing especially as we had been drinking some, we both cried a lot and I got on my bus in the morning feeling like shit. After I got home he apologized and said that he missed me, had panicked, that it was the entirety of the situation that had gotten to him and the fact that he had been unsure of his feelings and didn't want to cause me any hurt, and that he wanted to be in a relationship with me right now if I still wanted. I replied that it didn't feel too smart right now, as this had shook me a great deal due to the fact that everything had seemed so good before the conversation. I said that I needed to feel more secure, and wanted to wait until I felt like I could trust that this was actually what he wanted.

I made the decision to move back to his country at the end of summer, as by now I had most of my good friends there, had made a lot of memories during the past two years and didn't want those days to be over. Of course, I'd be lying if I said it didn't influence me that this was probably the only chance I would have to see where the situation with him could go, but it was important to me that that wouldn't be my only reason for going.

I moved into a shared house together with some other creatives, having found a part time job and started on a two-year online course in Graphic Design, while he moved back to the school for a second year there. It was great being able to meet again and he would often visit me and stay the night, as well as us spending weekends together either at my place or his. We have a lot of common friends from school, and met up with them while restrictions still allowed for it, again behaving like a couple. After three weeks of this I asked him if he wanted to be my boyfriend, and he said yes.

Throughout the fall we spent a lot of time together, increasingly so as society shut down more and more. We travelled to meet both his family and mine and everything felt mostly great. We watched movies, had creative nights, cuddled a lot. Sex was pretty good and consistent, although I noticed that he didn't really take initiative as often as I did and I longed a bit for that feeling of him just.. looking at me and saying ""God you're hot, I want you"" or something like that, y'know. Mostly sex started out as me starting to kiss him, then after some kissing and groping he would ask if I wanted to ""play"". But all in all we had a lot of fun, felt very comfortable with each other, laughed a lot and had a good time.

As Christmas approached, it got hard to meet up as his school was in a semi-quarantined state where they didn't want the students living in the dorms to meet up with people from the outside. He then moved in with me for a couple of weeks, attending classes online together with other students who don't live at school, and we decided to find an apartment together due to the situation being as it was and us having a really good time living together. It was definitely early, but the alternative was him moving back to his hometown two hours away as he didn't want to live at school and not be able to see me at all. We did find an apartment, and we were both super happy and excited and made a lot of plans for this new life.

We were separated for a couple of weeks during the holidays, and went back to hanging out online. One night we were sending fun pictures from our past months together back and forth. I asked him when he thought that we would have gotten together if it hadn't been for me asking him and he answered, ""I don't know, I guess I wasn't really ready then and didn't have any plans to ask you at that point, but I think that we would have gotten together eventually."" I was really taken aback, as he knew it was important to me after having some bad experiences in the past that if I were to enter into a relationship it would be with someone who knew that they wanted me; who had chosen to be with me. It hurt me especially due to the fact that he *had* asked me to be together at that time, and I felt that if he had changed his mind after the fact it would have been the right thing to tell me, because at that time I was starting to feel really insecure due to his going back-and-forth and might have wanted to cut my losses if he still wasn't sure. He apologized, said he understood and that it had been wrong of him not to talk to me more about the issue, but assured me that he was really glad things had turned out this way and that he had just needed a little push. Then he also said something that stung a bit; that he had talked to his mom about the situation during the summer and realized that he probably felt unsure because there wasn't the excitement with me that he had felt with other girls, due to him having known me for over a year at that point. But I guess it made sense, although I definitely had felt a lot of excitement over him, and we made up and moved on. 

The holidays passed, and we moved into a fantastic apartment on January 15th. The first few days were great; we're a good team when it comes to chores and it felt like a luxury to have the whole space for ourselves after having spent a lot of time in a small bedroom throughout the past months. We bingewatched the Office, played Mario Kart, drank wine and cozied up the place.

A few days ago we had a talk about sex, and I admitted that I felt, at times, like I have a greater physical desire for him than he has for me. He loves to cuddle and takes a lot of initiative to do that, which often makes me want more (as I find him super attractive and really crave that closeness), but a lot of the time it doesn't lead to anything even if I start touching him. We might be making out and cuddling, and I start getting my hopes up, but then he suddenly says that he wants to game and gets up, or just lets it fizzle out and goes on instagram. When we go to bed he often says he's sleepy, or he stays up longer than me to game because he's not sleepy yet. In the mornings he has online school, and I eventually get up and start doing my thing. Anyway, I said that I don't want to make him feel bad about it, just that I wanted him to know so that he can keep in mind to prioritize being more present with me sometimes, as he's often distracting himself with instant gratification stuff like games, instagram, facebook etc. and that as long as he's not going to the bathroom to jerk it to instagram people I'm not going to make it an issue. And he said "".. well, I can't say that that never happens.""

So basically, I learned that he has a number of people he's following on instagram - that he has met in real life - as well as facebook friends, whose pictures he masturbates to. According to him it was a regular habit when he was single, and after we got together it's happened when we haven't been physically together or after I've fallen asleep. Most of the time when I fall asleep I'm kinda sexually frustrated, but I don't want to make myself feel desperate by having to ask if he maybe would want to have sex instead of playing LoL. And this isn't even porn. It's just pictures of girls that he finds beautiful. I'm not a fan of porn, but I can understand why people are and don't have it as a dealbreaker. This doesn't feel the same at all. These are girls that he has met in some context and finds sexy. These are just people like me, but prettier (at least it's hard not to think that). Also it feels kind of creepy. I'm hurting so much right now.

At this point he understands it was wrong and said that he would quit and feels ashamed etc., but his next question after that was ""so should I just watch normal porn then, in such situations?"" And idk, but I'm heartbroken. I don't feel attractive. I don't feel special. I don't feel like he's mine. I feel stupid for having walked around looking at him, thinking ""that's my man, he's so sexy, I want to do stuff to him!!"" It feels like if anything was to be fixed at this point, it would take him saying that he's going to fix this for us, that right now all he's going to focus on is me and make me feel safe and wanted and desired.. not asking if he's to use regular porn. I told him all of this, and he apologized, saying he didn't need to watch porn at all right now. 

He says he'd do anything to make me feel safe again, but he hasn't really come up with any solutions himself and also said that it might be best to just break up as he's ashamed of what he's done and doesn't want me to be unhappy in the relationship because of him. 

My best friend said that she would have broken up with him on the spot. We've both been in relationships before where porn has become an issue, have both gotten our self esteem crushed by partners prioritizing porn or getting brainwashed by it. And this feels more personal than that. I'm kind of in a state of shock, as it all happened so suddenly. I might have been willing to try to get over it if I thought that I could, but right now it doesn't feel like that's possible. He says that he definitely finds me attractive and thinks I'm the prettiest girl he's seen, but how am I supposed to trust that right now? I think back to when he was unsure if he wanted to be with me and on how I wasn't as ""exciting"" as earlier girls he's had, and I just can't help but think that he doesn't really find me that attractive. I'm also really hurt because what he's done feels so disrespectful to me and our relationship, and because he didn't think about how this would make me feel if I knew. 

I'm just so sad. I do love him and know that he loves me, and I was so elated to be with this guy, we had so many plans and so much fun together. I really don't want to lose him if there's anything that can be done to get over this. I can't imagine moving back home, now that we had just started on this chapter and everything felt so good. But I feel like throwing up due to the mental images of him leaving our bed while I'm sleeping, going to the bathroom and jerking off to girls that he's met. Him doing that makes him feel like a stranger. I don't know what's reasonable. I'm really just panicking. 

Does anyone have any advice?

(If you don't already know, the idea with the subreddit is when you click on a picture, it could either be something awful, or something cute/cool. The awful stuff can get really bad too, some serious nsfl stuff) It was a funny video, and the posts he showed were a healthy mix of actual cursed riskyclicks and some nice meme song edits and the like. The cursed images were blurred out in the video, and I wanted the full experience (first FU) so I decided to give the sub a try.

&amp;#x200B;

At first, I was having fun. I didn't see anything too horrible, and the risk taking was actually pretty amusing. Unfortunately for me, I was about to see an image I might literally never be able to unsee. People joke about this, and I'm not kidding, the image I saw is burned into my brain.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not going to link it here, because I sincerely think nobody should look at it. You might think it isn't that bad, but it is. The picture I unfortunately came upon (skip a paragraph to remain pure) was a black and white image of a partially cannibalized women. I kid you not, complete nightmare fuel. Don't look it up. It isn't worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

So I immediately closed the image, but the damage was done. However, I was about to FU a second time, in a possibly worse way. I looked through the comments on the post and saw someone had linked a documentary on YouTube about the guy who did it. Thinking that knowing some background details might make the situation less creepy (which, to be fair, is sometimes true), I watched the video. I should have not watched it when YouTube said ""This content is Age-Restriced. Continue?"" I should have given up when it said ""This content is offensive to some viewers. Continue?"" and maybe the third confirmation box should have been my final red flag, asking me if I really wanted to see the video. 

&amp;#x200B;

Note to Reader: if a YouTube video makes you confirm 3 times that you really want to see it, don't watch the video. They aren't kidding around.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, watching the video made my situation so much worse. Turns out the guy who did this never went to prison, because he committed the crime in France and they deemed him insane, so no prison. When he moved to Japan, they couldn't arrest him for it so he walked free. He claims to have changed his ways, but this is so horrifying. Once again, not gonna link the video. Don't look it up.

&amp;#x200B;

The aftermath? No amount of r/Eyebleach could save me. This horrifying story and photo were burned in my brain. I was afraid of going to sleep, for fear of falling asleep thinking about it and having awful dreams. So I did the only reasonable thing. I stayed awake until past 5AM watching youtube and avoiding sleep until I was so tired I was able to fall asleep nearly instantly and avoid the nightmares. I woke up at 9:00 this morning for my biology class, and that's the story of how r/FiftyFifty stole my nights' sleep from me. (and maybe tomorrow's too, I'm still trying to find hope and love in the world before I have to go to bed)

I was given herpes by my now Ex girlfriend about 6 years ago. we have had breaks in those 6 years, and I have slept with other people. I always made sure to tell them beforehand what they were getting into, because I didn't want anybody to have to find out the way I did. Which was about 3 weeks in. ""Hey, so I have something to tell you. I don't know why I didn't tell you before, but I have herpes, and I think I had a breakout last time we had sex."" Sure enough as these herpes seem to be stress induced, and I am an extremely high stress person. About 2 days later my first genital herpes popped up. I figured it was no big deal, until I found out that it is something that you cannot get rid of, and you are infected for the rest of your life.  


Anyway Tangent over....  
TLDR: I got herpes from my Ex 6 years ago. I have been with other people since then. But I have always let them know beforehand that I had herpes. I let them know the risks and possibilities. As stated by a doctor. I even had a pamphlet and everything, although none of them ever read it....  


This next part is important to mention, as it will explain my predicament now. I have only ever worn condoms during sex once in my whole life. I know, I know. You all hate me and think I am irresponsible. You don't know the half of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Moving on. The issue at hand. I have been living with this shit for a few years now, as mentioned and this one time it fucking slipped my stupid ass fucking mind. I was sort of fantasizing about this girl, but I was keeping it to myself, as I was in a relationship. I figured it was safe in my head, plus shes very accomplished, and I never even finished school. She has the most amazing body it is perfection. Anyway, I assumed nothing would come of it, but I had hung out with her once after work, I guess I left an impression, because we were texting about work, and I mentioned that I had broken my no more than 2 drinks rule (I'm an Ex alcoholic, and not a nice one either) I have been going through some severe depression and was planning on killing myself and I needed to get out of my head. Different issues. Struggling to stay on topic. Fuck it.  


TLDR2: I had only hung out with this person once, and I really did not think that she was interested in me, more than just friends, which I was happy to keep that way. She heard I had a few drinks and said I should come over to her house, she had some coke and we could share. I thought fuck yes, I had been planning on buying some meth (also an ex meth addict) and I thought some nice rich person coke would do perfectly to get me out of my head and keep me from bugging a random homeless person. So I got in my car and I drove to her house, she asked me to pick up some whippets on the way, which really caught me off guard. This is such a fucking fail TLDR.  


Long story short, I fucking didn't think she wanted to fuck me, and she really did. she told me she thought I was really cute, and when I realized we had both been fantasizing about eachother, it sort of just blew up into coke fueled sex. I left the next morning while she was still sleeping because I had some shit I needed to do, and didn't realize till the next fucking day what I had done. I have never had to break the news after the fact, it was always so easy, because I just had to say ""hey, I have this, fucking me comes with risks."" No problem, I am not shy, but this one is different. Because now it's after the fact, and I am freaking the fuck out. I haven't eaten in 2 days, I want to tell her in person, but I can't do that till Tuesday, it is now Thursday. I can't fucking wait that long, I am struggling not to have a panic attack. And I know it's because I haven't eaten, I made myself food, but it's just sitting in front of me getting stale and the thought of eating it makes me gag. This on top of the fact that I just spent that last few days preparing myself to die, but then that night sort of snapped me out and gave me a little light. Now I am afraid I am going to completely destroy that light, and I straight up promised myself if I gave her herpes i'm going night night.  


How can I break this to her? Should I just call her up and say I have herpes. I am sorry. This seems the ideal choice for me, except for the fact that I really don't want to scare her away. To make it worse, she texted me that ""she thinks I am a really great guy, and she can't wait to see me again."" ""I replied If you only knew the half of it you probably wouldn't think that."" This was before I fucking realized what a retard I had been with the herpes. Now I feel like waiting is going to make it worse, but telling someone over the phone is even worse too.   


I need to stop typing or nobody will be able to read this madness.

I have an adorable yellow car that I am very proud of. I bought it using money my father passed on to me when he passed away in 2019 and the car is Pikachu themed. Last night, my step-father made a comment that I need to check my tires more often. Today, just before walking into work, I checked my tires. Each air valve had a neon green penis on it. I quickly took them off and threw them away. I messaged my step-father about what I had found and he admitted that he placed them on my car two weeks prior (yes, I know I'm very oblivious). I told him that it was immature, he needed to grow up and to not touch my property. He replied with his usual argument that if I am unhappy with his decisions, I need to move out and pay my own bills. In our argument, I brought up his parents, who basically pays for my step-father's niece's stuff so she can live away from her parents while in college. He's made comments about her being able to live on her own in the past.

I am currently taking a semester break to get help with my mental health, get help with my fibromyalgia and other physical issues, and get a diagnostic laparoscopic surgery.

I figured it’s good enough to share here. 

I was stationed in South Korea in 2018. I got food poisoning on a Tuesday(important detail) from somewhere on base. After a day of puking, I went to the doctor. He prescribed me some Zofran. I was able to keep food down on Thursday and was able to eat like normal on Friday and Saturday. Sunday is when everything goes to, excuse the pun, shit. 

Here’s where the NSFW stuff starts...

I decide to poop after breakfast. It wasn’t successful, which isn’t abnormal, but it felt weird. It felt like I was trying to pass a bowling ball. I tried thinking back to the last time I pooped and I couldn’t remember for sure. I went to the commissary and grabbed some laxatives and enemas. I took the laxatives and some preworkout, because most people who use it will tell you a poop is always in your future. I went to the gym and had no urge to poop the entire time I was there. I get back and take the enema. It was a weird experience I didn’t think I would encounter, but there we were. I felt like it did absolutely nothing. I’m weighing my options:

do I wait til tomorrow morning? No, I’m too uncomfortable. 

Can I go to the clinic on base? Nope. They’re past closing time. 

There’s only one solution... I call my direct supervisor and ask him to drive me to the off-base ER. I call him and explain the situation. Before he picks me up, I check my weight, ya know, to see how much weight I’m about to lose. 

Here’s where the TIFU takes a big step up. We are 2 American soldiers in a Korean hospital. The hospital workers are looking at me weird because I’m seemingly fine and I’m a big dude 6’3 275. There’s an English liaison. She’s literally the only person in the hospital who speaks English(I’m not complaining, I’m aware I’m not in my home country). They take me in to get X Rays. There is a bowling ball mass or poop just chilling inside my intestines. Essentially Zofran has a side effect of constipation. Since Im guessing I hadn’t pooped since pre-food poisoning, the poop in my body built up in my intestines, and dried out expanded some much that my intestines couldn’t push it out. 

We are almost at max TIFU and NSFW. The liaison brings in the least experienced nurse. They explain the situation, which is awkward. They’re going to stick a big enema up inside me and the poor nurse has to keep her finger inside my butthole FOR 10 MINUTES while the enema works it’s magic(the enema rehydrates the poop so it can be passed.) Me and my supervisor laugh, but I say I can totally do this. 

They put the enema in and I instantly know I am at peak TIFU. The nurse sticks her finger in my butt and I know there’s no way in hell I’m making it 10 minutes. I tell my supervisor to get the liaison because I’m not making it the full time. Him and the liaison are trying to give me words of encouragement to last the full time. 

I fought as hard as I could, but it reached a point when it felt like I couldn’t physically clinch my butthole. That’s when it happened... I shit all over the table and onto this nurse. It wasn’t one massive turd like [Randy Marsh in South Park](https://imgur.com/gallery/txyFV2l/comment/345665238). It was like a million marbles just came out of my ass. The liaison had me go to the bathroom to try and poop in the toilet, but lemme tell ya, I left it all on that table. 

I felt great because the bloat was gone, but I felt awful that I just left pounds of poop on a table for a nurse to clean up. Everyone was nice and understanding of the situation. We got back in the car and promised to never speak of the situation ever again. 

I got back to my barracks and weighed myself. I lost 8 pounds! My word of advice: be careful taking Zofran.

So about a year ago some friend and I went  to a 2-day music festival, this was the second day already.
we got all dressed up and ready and decided to call an Uber to get there 

As I usually do I started rolling some Joints for the festival and for them to last all day through, anyhow, the Uber arrived early enough and I didn't have much time to prepare so I just decided to continue on the way there, As I had done the day before and I usually do, I asked the driver if he minded if I rolled some weed and smoked in the car since some drivers do have issues with that (let's try to be respectfull c:)
And he very politely said he didn't mind and to carry on, so my friends an I started rolling, getting ready for the festival, passing the blunt around and having a nice conversation all together (it was quite a long ride lol)  after a little while I asked the driver if he wanted a hit or for us  to roll him up a J or smth,
To what he replied that no thanks cuz he did not smoke (but I could feel some fishy tone in his words) 
So I preceded to ask ""why?"", you know, just to keep the conversation flowing.

And it was then, that he very seriously turned around to look at us, and said ""Because I'm a cop"" **shows badge* *

I imagine after noticing this sudden change in the environment and the lame fear drived ice breakers we were throwing at him. 
This former driver, now cop, proceed to tell us "" Don't worry, I'm not on duty rn""
Which did ease a lot of tension knowing we weren't getting arrested right there on the spot.
I hadn't felt so relief in long time.

After a little while our hearts stopped racing and the nervous sweating stopped, and we proceed to talk amongst us for the rest of the drive

And yet i cant help but feel that i did, I think if i had been there i could save her, and yet the trauma of seeing her dead was so bad, i dont know how i would be if i had to witness her die in front of me.

Not that I will, but it reminds me of those people who commit suicide, and no one knows why cause they always seemed happy and genuine.

I've always had an issue with mental health counseling. The reason is because the CAO made me do EMDR 1 day after her death. I dont know if it was supposed to help, but the initial meltdown made me swear to use different methods. It was hard enough to have to come to terms without some person right there repeating her death to me every 10 seconds.

The weather has been pretty cloudy and rainy too on the last couple of days and I couldn't ride my bike and stayed with them and got bored sometimes. 

But today...I got really bored and AND horny. I can't nut with my imagination and didn't want to waste all my mobile data.

Holy shit I found it extremely hot and I just took the minifigure to the living room and fucking beat my meat and deadass stared at her. I was so horny I couldn’t at least go to the bathroom. 

What followed will forever haunt me. I climaxed JUST as my grandparents walk in the house, and because of the layout of their house you can see straight into the living room. They saw me. They fucking saw me. I immediately put my pants back on and flung the now cum-covered Lego Leia onto the back wall where the TV sat so the Lego Leia couldn’t be immediately seen. It’s probably still there, the now dried cum keeping it glued to the carpet underneath the entertainment center. Let’s just say my parents weren’t very glad to hear of this.

I (25F) recently got married to my husband (30M). He is my first everything (kiss, boyfriend, lover, etc) whereas he’s the complete opposite and has been divorced. We started dating when I was older and we lived together for a while before getting married so I know we’re comparable. However, I struggle knowing whether or not it’s my fault that our sex life has slowed drastically.

About a year and a half ago I learned by husband (then bf) watched porn. As this was my first relationship I didn’t really know how to react but I was ok with it as long as it didn’t interfere with our relationship and it wasn’t anything personal but rather just something he uses for a release. I was under the impression he was only watching it once a week or so. However during quarantine when we were together everyday I found out he was masturbating and watching porn sometimes 4-5x a week. This really bothered me because I had absolutely no idea when we had only been having sex once a week and a half or so. I confronted him about it and he just said it’s something he has always done and him and his ex had split because she saw porn as cheating. I told him that I was fine with porn (again) as long as he gave me time first when I was there and available rather than just ignoring me because it was easier. I also asked him to possibly include me in that space because it might help me grow in our sex life together, which hasn’t happened yet. 

Fast forward to now, my husband is an avid gamer, I’m talking about 8+ hours nonstop a day. I don’t say anything at all, I clean or cook quietly and stay to myself. I’ve spoken to him about gaming before and asked him to give me a little bit of his time and I’d be happy if he did that before gaming. Worked for a week then he stopped again. However, our sex life has rapidly declined. We’ve only been married a month and a half and haven’t had sex at all in the last two and a half weeks. He makes a feeble attempt once in a while to cuddle up to me or say something sexual but never initiates, I usually have to say something first. It makes me feel undesired and that I’m in a third wheel relationship with his game. He’ll come to me sometimes after he’s been gaming for 8 hours and make an attempt but by that time it’s 3 am and I’m half asleep. I’m not sure if his porn habits just take up what’s left of his sex drive and gaming takes up the rest of the time but where’s the time for me?

I have to mention he told me he was previously told by a doctor he has low testosterone.

And probably will for a very long time to come. 

Anyway, I live with a roommate in one house. We’re pretty close and we often just walk into each other’s rooms for a chat or a beer. Which is awesome. The only obvious downside of all that is that it can be hard to get some privacy sometimes. Of course we do the whole sock on the doorknob thing when we’re with someone, but if you just want to “be with yourself” for a while, the only safe option is the shower. 

Today I woke up, drank my coffee, ate my breakfast, and got horny. You know, the usual routine. I always “do my thing” in the shower for privacy reasons. And sometimes I watch porn on my phone during. But almost always without sound so no one can hear me. 

BUT since I had a pretty good month in December, I decided to treat myself to a brand-spanking new set of way too expensive Apple AirPods. I hike a lot, so I figured these would be nice to have for music or podcasts while I walk around. And I was right, they’re awesome! But while they are great for said music or podcasts. They also work great if you want to watch porn (with sound) in the bathroom before you shower, and you don’t want your roommate to hear. 

And that, my dear friends, is exactly what I did. And it was wonderful. It’s been so long since I actually watched porn WITH sound, it made the whole experience exceptionally enjoyable. And with this newly added benefit of sound, I finished my chore rather quickly. I cleaned up, put my phone away and got in the shower. 

The shower was nice. Just like it always is. But, I don’t know, the running water just sounded different. A bit muffled or something. Kinda weird? “Whatever” I thought, as I continued washing myself. It was only after a solid 5/6 minutes of showering, I realized I STILL HAD MY FUCKING AIRPODS IN. shit. 

As I am writing this, my beloved, brand new and very expensive (to me) AirPods are drying in a bowl of rice. They are fucked. I tried them, but they don’t work anymore. I’m hoping they will after drying up. But if they don’t, at least I’ll have a funny, albeit kind of embarrassing story to tell at parties. And to you guys!

I've told friends sugar coated versions of this story but never the truth, so I'll let it out here. This ended up being long and I want it all out so TLDR at the bottom.

Maybe 4 years ago, when I \[22F\] was in college, I had a Tinder phase. I used Tinder mainly as a hookup app, but some people were super sweet.

There was this one guy, whose name I still don't remember, who matched with me and was really nice and funny. We met up and it turned out he was a virgin (we were the same age) and this was his first time ever, not just hooking up on tinder. Well, the night in his car didn't exactly go smoothly. He may have had the biggest shlong I have ever seen, the condom he brought may have been too small, I may have queefed in his face when it was his first time eating a girl out, I may have farted in his face thinking it was a queef that resulted in us awkwardly standing outside his car with doors open to air it out, and I may have given up trying to lead and shove his massive shlong in me and finished him with my mouth.

It was awkward, but he was cute. We met up a few times and we made out and did other stuff in his car, but we never attempted it again. He ended up kind of ghosting me, which I accepted, and we went on with our lives.

So, I'd like to say about 2 years later, I went to Dave and Busters with my friends. I was just hanging out and having fun, then this tall random stranger looking like Shaggy looked at me and called out my name with a shy smile.

I dead ass did not recognize this man and I just stared back thinking how tf does he know my name. He said my name again and then I vaguely remembered him, but not his name. So to be polite I said

Me: ""Hey! Ummmm""

Him: ""Insert white boy name I don't remember""

Me: ""Yeah hey! Wow how are you??""

I didn't want to be rude and desperately tried to remember things about him, and it all came out horribly. I first asked if he was here with his girlfriend (which made sense in my mind since we met on Tinder???) and said no he didn't have one, and for some reason I let out a very sad sounding ""oh""....

Then I remembered he was really into old films, but it came out as ""you liked movies right?"".

He said yeah, and I'm like aw well it was nice seeing you!

And then we separated and my friend was laughing her ass off. She said later in the prize section he saw me and did a 180.

...Everyone remembers when they lost their virginity and who it was to, even if you don't remember all your hook-ups. I feel so bad because he probably thinks the girl who took his V card doesn't remember him.

If you're reading this, I remember you Dave/Michael/Stanley, I just don't remember your name I'm sorry.

TLDR: Took a guy's virginity, queefed and farted in his face, got ghosted, met up years later and forgot him and proceeded to sound like I really did forget him probably hurting his feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi ya'll. Thanks for the awards! To clarify, no I'm not black I'm Chinese, not sure how you came to that conclusion. I didn't mean to offend anyone with the name joke, his name was literally something like ""John"" or ""Dave"". And this is blowing up unexpectedly so I'm going to log out of this account and read the comments from my main haha! He was genuinely a sweet person and I wish him the best. If you recognize this, don't DM me and I'm gonna believe you've never seen this and I'm never using this account again. Also, nothing wrong with hooking up with people (obv not now) as long as you stay safe, and queefing is normal, it happens. Trust me if I had any control over that I would choose not to let that happen...ever....unless someone has a queef fetish then maybe

Last edit then I'm out! There is nothing wrong with hooking up with someone as long as everyone is consenting, safe, and you take care of yourself physically and mentally. Sometimes people just want to have sex cause they're horny. And to the people saying how could I forget the guy wtf blablabla.... it was literally 2 years later! He ghosted me not the other way around (no hard feelings though) and he looked completely different and I didn't remember everything on the spot! By then I deleted tinder and was focused on other things. And even if someone did forget their hookup partner, hey it happens. Everyone is different. Some people want a meaningful person to person connection every time they have sex, others feel differently.

Let me explain with a personal story and then some real life examples(skip to the end for a tl;dr)

I don't have a big dick, I don't have a lot of experience, I'm a teenager. I was in a relationship with a person who had a high body count, and there's nothing wrong with that, but to me it just made me feel less special. It made me think, ""well what's the difference between me and their best friend"" (They had a sexual history with them)

At the beginning of the relationship I constantly heard, ""oh yeah I've done that with so and so before""

And I knew that no matter how much I tried, I'd never be anything new to them. I'd never be anything different, I'd never be the biggest or the first at anything. 

END

My point is, it's not as black and white as, ""oh well my dick isn't gonna feel good"" It's about feeling special to someone, it's about feeling confident in themselves, it's about having something to show off.

And to the real life examples that size matters.

Have you ever heard anyone say, ""I want a man with a small dick to fuck the shit outta me"" Or ""I want you to break me with your small dick""

The only time I've seen small penises used sexually is in humiliation porn. HUMILIATION PORN.

There's nothing good about having a small penis, there's no benefits.

Women nowadays use dildos or vibrators and i think thats very good. But when i asked people why or if its okay for men to use utensils to ""jerk off better"" everyone said thats sad or disgusting or only virgins  do that and i dont understand why.

Why is it considered sad for men but progressiv for women. in my opinion it feels better than just my hand and it can be considered as ""training"" for your first time. the last thing is a very weird opinion im not really sure about but  it COULD help people.

My gf and I have been dating for 3 years. Friends for 6. 2020 was not our year (was it any bodies year?). 

Anyways, I got a new job at the beginning of 2020 and had to start working out of town. At first I was out of town 9 days, in town 5. This lasted at least 6-7 months, maybe more (despite covid). In that timeframe I accidentally got my girlfriend pregnant (she was on BC). She had an abortion. Which, looking back on, I don’t regret, but it still tore me up pretty bad. I will admit I’m an alcoholic.. so, I turned to alcohol to cope. Blacking out every night caused me to lose track of my phone so we would hardly ever talk. Text here &amp; there, 5 minute phone call after work and then off to the bar I went. She would always try to call or text but I was so liquored up I couldn’t even see my phone properly until I sobered up the next day. Eventually, I decided I couldn’t keep on like this. So, I told my work I HAD to work at least in the same state. I started drinking less. I was home more. We had a chance to rekindle things a little bit, but we had a long way to go still. Things were looking up though. 
Then out of nowhere, they started sending me out of town again. They claim there’s no work in our state due to covid and if I didn’t want to travel I would be out of a job. This time it was only 4 days out of town and home for the weekend. As I write this today, it marks exactly one year of traveling out of state for work.  But, this time it was manageable because I was only out of town for 4 days. I thought our relationship was getting better. On the weekends we’d connect. I thought things were going good. But as of the past couple months, she’s always grumpy with me, never wants to have sex, and is always making me feel guilty for being out of town so much. I try to spend as much time with her as I can on the weekends, but she says it’s not enough. 

I don’t want to get a new job. I have a great paying job, great insurance, I work with people I get along with great. Overall, I really really like my job (minus the traveling). 

Another thing I should note is that I suffer from premature ejaculation. Always have. When things are good between us and we’re having a lot of sex I can usually rein it in and last longer. We have the potential to have a great sex life. We’ve done it before. But, it’s been at least a year since that’s been the case. I feel like she’s giving up on me and I just don’t know what to do. With her getting pregnant and having an abortion it’s also a strain on our sex life. 

So, between being and alcoholic and not being able to satisfy her sexually I am feeling pretty low about myself already....

I'm usually a very rational person, so if this sort of thing shouldn't be a big thing I don't want it to be.

So my friend on discord added me to a group which there were around 8 people in. I didn't know any of them well besides my friend. They sent stuff like memes, i sent some too and chatted with some of them.

After around 30 minutes one of them sent a link and tagged me without saying a word, so i opened the link from my curiosity. A black box appeared which said something like ""This website contains dark humor, do you wish to continue?"" And there were two options, yes and no. The website link didn't look sketchy and i tought it was something like a meme generator, so I clicked yes, and i got jumpscared. I quickly closed my browser. The jumpscare was SO LOUD that my ear was ringing for like 30 seconds and i got so scared that i was shaking for 10 minutes. I went to the group and asked what the fuck was that for, they laughed. The guy who sent the website didn't apologize or anything but I didn't really mind because i saw it as a joke. Then after a while another person sent a video, i thought it was a meme or something so my stupid fucking ass clicked it, and it was the worst and most disturbing video I've ever seen. It wasn't a jumpscare, it was a VERY messed up and gory video that looked like it was from dark web or some shit. 


**WARNING: THIS MAY BE DISTURBING FOR SOME PEOPLE**

&gt;!The video was like a real life happy tree friends, a woman bit off another woman's arm skin and blood pumped out of it like fucking tap water, and i should have paused the video there and left the group already, but i didn't. I continued to watch from my curiosity. There were other stuff like A woman shooting herself in her vagina with a shotgun, and so much more worse stuff that i don't want to write here.!&lt;
I then left the group without saying a word.



TL;DR: My friend added me to a group and someone sent a link in it, i opened it from my curiosity, got jumpscared and then another person sent a video, i watched it from my curiosity and it was the most messed up thing I've seen in my life.

**Edit: So many people asked for the link, the jumpscare website was kekma, here's the [knowyourmeme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/kekmaga) page of it if you want to find out more about it.

I think that the problem is that I may have accidentally trained myself to only be able to fall asleep when I’m thinking about sexual shit. It’s how I’ve gotten to sleep almost every night for the better part of my life. It would make sense that it’s hard for me to think about sexual shit to fall asleep if I had already came very recently.

However, I think it’s actually a combination of that and the fact that my dick sort of just feels… off? It’s like I’m trying to go to sleep and the rest of my body feels completely at ease and relaxed, but my dick still feels the aftermath of my previous sesh.

But after talking to few of my friends I got to know that the girl was the student of my once teacher and also that we share many mutual friends. I never did know about her till yesterday but somehow it slowly started to feel as harsh and painful as to loose a friend.
I started to dig deeper into the story and found much gruesome details of the story. The rapist was a 21 year old and was the victims boyfriend.The girl died from excess bleeding from her genitals and from bruises which were evidence of brute force. She was lured by her boyfriend into visiting him at his house when his parents weren't there. It is also suspected that there were 3 more peoples involved in the case who were the rapist's friend and that this might be a case of gang rape.
This whole thing messed up lot of people just like me. Every female friend of mine are now too scared to trust anyone. Every guy like me is ashamed of the existence of men like him. And sadly this isn't even the worst part to the whole scenario. Our country is full of narrow minded people and thus there happens to be a sea of people who are now blaming the victim,slut shaming her instead of seeking justice for an innocent teenager. And the far worse thing is that the rapist comes from a wealth and influential family with political ties,and that his father already is looking to bail him out. This isn't something new, it's been happening in my country for ages now but after this I'm just tired of pretending it's ok to just sit like ducks. Yet again I can't do anything about it and nor can the people who are now sitting in their rooms filled with hatred,anger,sorrow and defeat. I only pray that no soul needs to face something as gruesome as this.... Tomorrow I'll be joining the hundreds of people who decided to stand up for her to light up candles in her name.

I started seeing this guy, we'll call him Dan, very very shortly after ending things with a long term boyfriend. It was a rough breakup, we lived together and everything, and I explained all of this to Dan so he was aware that I wasn't in a good emotional place to start a relationship, but I also admitted to really, really liking him. We hooked up a few times late last year, and talked constantly - almost 24/7. I had to leave him to go home for winter break (we're in college), and admitted that I had serious feelings for him during our last night together. He agreed, and did a lot of intimate things before I left like holding me really tightly while I teared up over leaving him.

I went home for winter break and we still talked constantly. I made plans to see him (with some of our mutual friends) on my birthday and he was ridiculously excited. At this point, we had not labeled ourselves ""officially dating"" because I was worried about backlash from my parents, who were really vocal about how I should stay single for a while after ending a long term relationship. However, we had already discussed our feelings for one another, told each other we were not involved with other people, and he had already been calling me pet names for about a month at this point.

Fast forward 7 or 8 months, I find out he had gone to a party the night before we met up for my birthday, and had made out with a girl there. I knew from our mutual friends that he had made out with her a couple of times, but I assumed it was before we had started getting serious, until one of them let it slip that it was ""around December or something"" — which was after we had started hooking up and confessed our feelings for one another. I confronted him about this and he got really, really nervous and said ""Yes, I did make out with her in December, but I thought I had already told you."" He definitely had not told me.

I scrolled through our old texts, trying to find a sign in his texts that he had been with her that night. I put the pieces together and realized it had actually been the night before my birthday (late January) when he and I were already thoroughly involved. I confronted him again and he acted confused for a long time and said he ""genuinely didn't remember it being the night before my birthday"" but then later on fessed up to lying about the date to try to make the situation sound less bad.

I'm not even that hugely bothered that he made out with this girl — I'm just so upset about the continuous lying. I made it clear to him very early on that I'm a very accommodating person when it comes to someone's needs - I've even been in open relationships before. My only requirement is that he been entirely open and honest with me, since my past two relationships have ended due to my partners cheating on me, which gave me some serious trust issues.

I try to brush it off and get over it, but it's definitely eating away at me. He has a history of moderate infidelity - his last relationship ended because he felt unwanted by his girlfriend, which led him to seeking attention from a few of his female friends (liking/commenting flirty things on his friend's bikini picture, cuddling with one of his friends while drunk, and even whipping his hard dick out when a group of he and a few of his female friends were extremely drunk).

Fast forward a few more months - due to consistently finding out little white lies he had told me here and there, and then finding out about his past with his female friends, I didn't feel secure enough to become ""publicly official"" with this guy - I was worried about telling my family I was dating him, because I was worried he would pull some more sketchy stuff with me. My last breakup was a mess for my family to try to help me through, and left them feeling really upset because they were attached to my ex boyfriend as well. I was really worried about this happening again with Dan. HOWEVER, I was still absolutely head over heels for Dan. Despite his somewhat sketchy behaviors here and there, I have genuinely never been so attracted to someone, and felt so compatible with him. Being with him felt like being high because we were so in sync and enjoyed each other's company so much, not to mention the extreme physical chemistry we had.

Dan consistently said that he was absolutely fine with not being publicly official. I was very loyal to him and open/honest with him about absolutely everything, and consistently explained that the only reason we weren't official is because of my trust issues and my parents' disdain for me getting into another relationship. He said he totally understood this and while he would still prefer to be publicly official/Facebook official, he was just happy to be with me.

In the past few months, my mental health has really gone downhill. One of my close family members suddenly fell ill and has been in hospice care for a few months. This has led to stress in my family, and some fights with my parents. I'm also a healthcare worker in an extremely understaffed and overwhelmed hospital, so work has been grueling and sad. I know I started to get more and more depressed during this time, and it took a toll on Dan, who is not used to having family stress and doesn't have to work more than 15 hours a week at a music store since his parents help him out so much financially, so he's a very consistently happy and content person. He wasn't coping well with my frequent sad moods.

One night, a couple months ago, I went to stay the night at his place. When I came in, his roommates were very rude and quiet towards me, which was completely out of the ordinary - I had become good friends with them over the time I had been seeing Dan. I asked Dan privately what was going on and he acted confused and insisted he didn't know. I went to bed extremely upset and confused. He fell asleep quickly, and I stayed up for hours, panicking over what was wrong. I tried to message one of his roommates on snapchat to ask what was wrong, only to find that she had blocked me.

I feel really bad about this, but I ended up getting on his phone. He had never been territorial over his phone before, and he had even handed me his unlocked phone in the past to make the point that I could trust him and get on his phone any time. He had also put his passcode in in front of me several times, and it was just his birthday. So I got on it, and searched my name in his texts to see if he had been talking to his roommates about me. I didn't find texts with them, but I found texts with his other close friend where he talked about my ""depressing moods"" and how he ""needed to find someone who could stand on their own two feet better"". I was horrified and looked through his phone to see what else he had been lying about. I saw that he had downloaded Bumble and had been using it for a while without telling me, but had since deleted it. I also saw that he had made a Tik Tok account specifically for following and commenting on girls twerking and doing other sexy acts, and he had me blocked on the account. He had been using that account almost daily for about five or six months.

I got up and drove home without saying goodbye to him. When I had organized my thoughts, I called him to ask if we could have a serious conversation. He said yes. I asked him if he was really in love with me, or if he just loved having me around as a friend. He said he didn't think he was in love with me anymore and just loved me as a person. I broke down crying and hung up on him. He drove to my place to talk to me in person and apologized, and frantically claimed that he had misspoken because he was panicked. He said he did love me, but he was upset with the situation (not being publicly official). I confronted him about what I had found on his phone. He felt really bad and told me he didn't blame me for getting on his phone. He explained that a few of his friends/roommates disliked me because I made him sad and they were worried about him. I asked him if he had told any of them about his Tik Tok or Bumble accounts and he said no. I asked him if there was anything else he was hiding from me, and he admitted that he would sometimes go on Omegle to flirt with women. He apologized profusely and broke down, condemning himself for being a liar and explaining that he was just immature for doing all of those things. He told me he did desperately want to be with me, even though he had been telling people that he was thinking about breaking things off with me. He told me he would go to therapy and get on medication for his anxiety so he could start being open and honest with me.

I felt bad that he was so broken up over the situation and even though I was so upset with him, I still loved him. I ended up letting him sleep over, and since then, we've pretty much gone back to acting like normal. He's been much more affectionate and told me I could get on his phone whenever I felt like I needed to. He has followed through and started regularly going to therapy and taking medication.

However, I'm just still left feeling sick and ruminating over all of the things he's hidden from me throughout the relationship. I believe he is trying to get better, but I worry I'm just being naive, and he's going to end up fucking me over because he knows I'll keep forgiving him.

     So a little background I’ve been with my(24F) boyfriend (33M) for a a little over 10 months and we generally have a very loving and caring relationship. We moved in together at the 6 month mark cause we felt we were ready to take things to the next level. He’s really good to me, psychically and he supports my dreams. 
      So we’re a little kinky maybe a lot! We like to try new things all the times within our boundaries and we’re both each others best sex. During Christmas he got me the best presents, everything I asked for and I got him some cute things but he had requested multiple times for a threesome and how that would be the best gift to him. We talked about how a threesome would look and the rules we had for each other. I talked to someone (24F) I knew that we were both interested in about it and they were down. 
        Christmas Day comes and we’re partying a lot and having fun and as the night is coming to an end and our small gathering of people are leaving the three of us start to play truth or dare and dirty games. We end up taking our clothes off and getting hot and heavy with each other. We tease each other and make out and it’s all good and we move over to the bed. The Bf’s dick doesn’t work tho so us girls just have our fun and we all go to sleep in the same bed cause we were drunk. 
          I had work the next day early in the morning so I had to get up and get ready and it was surprising that I was even able to make it there. I left them there sleeping and I knew I was fine if they made out or anything like that but anything more and that where I drew the line. My friend texts me in the middle of work that she had to leave and I thanked her and let her know how much fun I had. I come home from work and I just wanna take a nap but Bf drops it on me that he had sex with her and he feels bad and he knew it was wrong. At that point I feel hurt and betrayed and he apologizes and tries to justify his actions by telling me we emasculated him by making fun of how he couldn’t get it up and he had something to prove by that. Idk I’m just hurt and it takes me some time to process it and I end up forgiving him and we make it a rule to not have a threesome when we’re hammered. 
          A couple days pass and we have sex, normal sex but I couldn’t enjoy myself and reach orgasm so I tell him I’m in my head and it’s hard. We try again later and it’s the same thing, I can’t have fun or orgasm at all even though I used to easily from just his hands. Now I’m thinking I haven’t fully processed everything and I just don’t know how to go about it. My heart doesn’t hurt because of the incident anymore but I guess my body is feeling the effects. 
Idk what I’m looking for but I guess I just needed some different perspective. Did anybody ever experience something similar or if anybody has any advice it would be greatly appreciated.

I (23M/ UK) have been disowned by, and estranged from my entire family for 5 years now. 

I knew that I was queer (and I’m using queer to simplify things) from the time I was 12. 

My parents were teenagers when they had me and they split up the year after I was born. Both of them later married and had more children. My mother became very religious and was not at all happy when I came out to her. At first she tried to ignore it but eventually she decided she could do so no longer, she said she wouldn’t allow me to be myself under her roof so she sent me to live with my father when I was 14. 

My father is an agnostic and isn’t queer-phobic so he accepted me. However, he began to use his acceptance of my sexuality to groom me. He started making sexual advances and he told me he could “help me learn about sex.” I was very uncomfortable but I didn’t know what to do about it. He would blackmail me. 

So I decided that I would rather live with my mother, I would later very much regret this but at the time I felt that I would be safer physically if I lived with my mother. I was 15 when this happened, and I haven’t seen my father, or my sister since. 

I felt like what had happened was my fault and that I deserved it because of my sexuality. 

Eventually, I did report him to the police, and there was a two year investigation. My sister (who would’ve been about eight at the time.) was questioned by a police officer and she didn’t disclose any abuse. Afterwards it was sent to the crown prosecution service but unfortunately charges were dropped. When I did this I was 17 and his entire side of my family believed him and blamed me for “ruining his life.” And I was promptly disowned. 

My mother was horribly abusive throughout my adolescence and I was made homeless at 18. She hates me for being queer, and even more so for being an atheist. I also reported her to the police multiple times, in order to try to protect my brother, and because of that she disowned me. 

My family are horrible people, but thankfully I am doing well now. 

Which leads me to why I am here. I found out that my sister has tumours and needs to be operated on. She’s also being treated with codeine and naproxen? (I have no idea what naproxen is.) and so far that is all I know. I know that there are different types of tumours but I know that none of them are particularly great even when benign.  

My question now is: what do I do? My plan had always been that I would wait until she was an adult to have a relationship with her and that I would explain to her then that it was never her doing as to why I left. I was planning to tell her the truth when she was old enough to understand. 

I know that my explanation will never replace the years I was gone, but I want to be able to be honest with her about why. I can’t tell a 12 year old these things. 

Whatever my sister is going through, I don’t want her to think she has some arsehole brother out there that doesn’t care about her. 

So, what do I do?",0,0,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,nsfw,My Little Sister (12F) Has A Tumour.

I wasn't too worried until it persisted for several hours. That evening I starting looking online and got freaked out by this ""testicular torsion"" ordeal, so I figured if it didn't go away soon I'd get it checked out. Well, it didn't go away in one ball, and pain was getting pretty bad. I decided it's better to be safe than sorry. I've heard horror stories about this, and I don't like the idea of possibly losing a testicle. I managed to drive myself to the local ER as it's late at night at this point. That was embarrassing in it's own right, but whatever, I'm sure they see this often enough. Well after the ultrasound found nothing wrong other than inflammation, the doctors just gave me some pain meds and sent me on my way. They basically said to me, in a nice way, that I came to the ER for blue balls. My gf and I weren't even doing anything to cause that, but whatever.

The FU: After a year of not hearing anything from the hospital, I assumed the insurance took care of the visit cost. Well, I was wrong. I just received a bill in the mail...for over a thousand dollars! For a 1 hour visit! Ugh. I'm a broke college student, so now I'm going to face the super awkward conversation with my parents. ""Remember when I went to the ER for blue balls? Yeah, that. Can you help pay for it?"". I don't know how I'm going to do it, as we aren't super open about that kind of stuff.

TL;DR: I panicked that I was having testicular torsion, went to the ER just to find out I actually just had blue balls in one ball.

  It started off as him having a higher sex drive, that I came from a conservative family that believes in no sex before marriage so I was dealing with guilt there, and that a medical condition was making it rather painful for me, so he would usually have to do a lot of convincing for me to get into having sex, and after hesitancy I'd usually get into it. But then he stopped listening to the ""no"" and ""stop"". I couldn't keep my pants on to keep him out of me, he was too strong and very determined. And even if my asking and begging to not have sex worked, hed get so depressed he'd cry and beg me to let him have sex, especially when he was hurting from not having sex. It has gotten a lot better now. It hasn't happened in a long while, he's changed so much, its like he is a different person. He has become incredibly respectful, very gentle, and if I tell him I need a break he immediately says alright and doesn't get upset. It's so nice to be able to breathe again... but I can't completely,  bc in my mind I still replay those nights, those moments, the feeling of fear and anger and pain and hurt... and sometimes I become angry or shut down and depressed for days, and it worried him and my family so much, but when they ask I tell them its not them they can't help me and itll pass.

Every time I visit my mom she always tells me some fucked up and disturbing anecdote. Tonight she decided the topic she would go on and on about was sexual abuse. I don't mind deep conversations about unpleasant topics but I don't like talking about sexual stuff with my mom. She actually told me two very disturbing anecdotes about cocsa (child-on-child sexual abuse for those why may not know the acronym). The first one I just don't have time to get into but the second one involved me.

She said that when I was 3 or 4, our landlord came to talk to my dad about something at our house. His grandson (who was 9 or 10) was with him for the day so he brought him along. Mom said that dad and the landlord talked on the porch while she watched T.V. She sent the grandson to play in my room with me which I immediately thought was weird. What does a 9 or 10 year old boy have in common with a 3 or 4 year old girl?

She said she left the door open, but that after a few minutes she decided to check on us only to find that the door was closed. She opened it to find him holding me down to my bed with my dress pulled up to my chest. She said that I wasn't crying or asking him to stop but that I clearly didn't look happy either. She said she stood and watched for a few seconds before yelling at him to get out.

The thing is...I don't remember this at all. She said she tried not to make a big deal of it, which must've worked because I literally don't remember this. She said she asked me to pee to make sure that there was no blood or anything, and there wasn't. She never said if she told dad about it or not. I assume not. She said that I didn't seem upset after the fact.

And what upsets me the most about this is that for a second or two I started getting aroused upon hearing about the part where he apparently had me pinned to the bed. Like, that tingle-throb feeling you get in your vag...I'm sure other women know what I mean. I feel so goddamn disgusting for this.

I've felt sick all night because of this. My head is racing. I've always found myself scared and anxious around boys and men. Maybe I finally have my answer as to why.

This is not something I expected to come here needing help with, but then again, I didn't expect to be having this issue either.

I am a 34F in a relationship with a 25M. We started dating last February long distance after meeting at work a year prior and I moved down in September to live with him. It's been a hell of an experience and I'm in a better place than I've ever been, physically, mentally and otherwise.

For a bit of background, he was a virgin when we met. (I've mentioned him elsewhere in other threads for more details). Before me, he'd been completely asexual. No masturbating, no orgasm. He'd had to learn all that while we were together. Even to this day, his method of masturbating to finish is unorthodox.

I also need to mention he is not on medication but has HFA (fka Asperger's) and ADHD. We think the ADHD may be the culprit in this issue. (Everything is controlled through daily living and mindfulness, hence the lack of meds.)

Whenever we try to initiate sex, it doesn't matter how much foreplay we do (on either side), it doesn't matter how turned on he is. The second something goes ""wrong"", he goes soft and loses his erection completely. When I say goes ""wrong"", I mean something that's unexpected. Am I not wet enough and need some lube? Soft. Is he having trouble entering me the first try? Soft. Did he want to try a new position and it takes a moment to shift to it? Soft. Did I want to spend some time just playing and teasing with him when he's already hard? Soft.

Sometimes he can get it back, but usually we have to resort to a dildo, or a harness and strap on toy (for someone still learning his sexuality, he's incredibly comfortable with things like that, and that's one of the reasons I love him) to get it done. He says he enjoys himself either way and I believe him, but it hurts a lot when sex sort of... stops, and collapses, or can't start at all. There's been way too many tears shed from both of us over this issue. I feel like I'm not doing something right, he feels like less of a lover, like he's broken. He's never been able to come outside of his way of jacking off either, let alone in me.

It's exhausting. It's tiring. It's emotionally draining. We both feel like something's wrong.

He's in good shape physically. There's no heavy drinking. We've tried ED meds - same result. We've tried several types of lube - sometimes the results improve, but he's still more often than not going soft. I've looked up potential sex-positive therapy to see what could be an issue, a doctor's visit to suss out any underlying conditions (his family doesn't have a history of issues, let alone these ones, from what I understand.)

But I want to know if there's something else we can try. I put no pressure on him, I constantly reassure him how sexy I find him, I am completely patient and happy to show him what I like while he's learning me. I've spent tons of time on his body, orally, otherwise. He says that often his brain will work too hard instead of just being in the moment and that's when the softness happens.

I'm 100% committed to figuring this out and how to resolve it. I just don't know how to tackle this problem because I've never run into this issue before. I've tried reading up on everything I can about how ADHD can affect sexuality but none of the fixes offered online seem to lead anywhere.

So, in case there's someone out there who may be familiar with anything I've talked about, I am eager for any advice you could throw my way. Please send me any questions if there's something I've missed.

Thank you in advance.

First, a little background on me. Before my current relationship, I haven't had one in over a year. Nor have I had any form of attention from the opsite sex, much less intamacy. This doesn't bother me though because I am much more interested in being in a good relationship with someone I am into than just a hookup. My brain however, begs to disagree. See, 2 nights ago I was on a video call with said gf (socal distancing and all) , and we started to get a little frisky for the first time. It ended in a lot of dirty talk, and I had the best orgasm of my entire life. When we finshed it was like 4 am, and we both had work the next day, this is where the fuck up begins.

An hour after passing out, I woke up with the most raging hard on in my entire life. After quickly beating another one out, I fell back asleep for a few hours, only to be woken up by my alarm, with another raging hard on. I didn't have time for a third fap in less than 6 hours, so I figured it would just go away, and I continued about my morning routine. I work an over-the-phone IT job, where my entire job is to listen to customers and help them fix their problems with our technology. Normally this isn't so bad, but between my still horny brain and very little sleep, I could not pay attention to anything the customers were saying. I asked people to repate their problems at least twice all day. To make matters worse, I had spurts through the day where I was erect for over an hour. Guys by the time I got home, it physically hurt for me to be hard, I think I pulled a muscle or something. All in all, I had failed at my job all day, I had boner pains and a brain that couldn't care less about it. 5/10 experience, would still probably do it again

So, let’s start with a little bit of backstory: My GF and I have been together since May 2019 (We once broke up in February 2020 but came back together in April, but that’s not really important here). This is my first relationship. Our relationship has been amazing in the past, we had a lot of fun together, went on dates, had very little arguments, in the ones we had, we both tried to be as calm and understanding as possible and we also showed our love for each other physically. It was like ,,the one’’ relationship.

Things have somewhat changed lately. For example, physical contact has decreased to a minimum. The last time we had sex was in June (before that we’d have sex once or twice a week). It was okay with me for the first time, but it really bothers me now. I politely asked her a few times if she wanted to have sex, but she’ll always say things like ,,I’m not feeling well’’, ,,It’s too hot/cold to have sex’’ or ,,I’m on my period rn’’ even when I know for sure she isn’t. Since around November, things started to get weird. If we kiss, I’m always the one who goes in for the kiss first, sometimes she even turns away and only lets me kiss her cheek. She’s rarely hugging me and when we lie in bed, she usually just turns her back on me and browses through instagram or snapchat. She’s also acting kind of strange around me. When she’s on her phone, she always turns it away from me, so I can’t look at it. We usually text each other things when we go to bed (like ,,good night, i love you’’) and stuff but she only would text these things back, if i texted her these before and two weeks ago, she completely stopped texting them. When i ask about it she usually says that she was already sleeping, but when I check my phone in the mornings (I usually get up before her) I see that she was last online on Instagram on 1 a.m or something and I texted her I was going to bed at 10.30. Also, she often opens my snapchats but answers them like 2 hours later or doesn’t open them for a long period of time but sends snaps to keep her streaks or posts stories or texts me during this time. This also happens especially in the evenings/at night. I cautiously confronted her about all these things a couple times, but she’ll always say things like ,,Really? I didn’t even realize, I’m sorry’’ or ,,Oh, I didn’t want to make you feel that way’’. I really love her and don’t want her to be mad at me, so I never say anything back or start arguing. 

Yesterday I was at her house to celebrate New Year’s Eve with her and her parents. When midnight came by, I was expecting to get a kiss from her, but she didn’t even make a move. I was a little mad, but decided it wasn’t worth it, because it was only a small issue and kept quiet. I slept over at her house and when I left this morning I told her I love her, but she didn’t say it back like usually, she just said bye. 

I don’t want to indicate that I think she’s cheating, because I don’t think so, I trust her and I can’t imagine her doing that, but I definitely think that something’s not right here.

So I want to ask you: Is there really something odd here, or am I just making things up? And if there is: Do you have any idea why? Why could/would she do these things? What could be wrong here? Could it be my fault? And what can I do to make things alright again?

He knows me well, and I know him well. So he likes pranking, and I like pranking too, It's okay, we get along fine.

So anyways, after our last date, I told him I'm probably gonna sleep with this girl in a couple of days.

That's what happens, Maria's in my room, things get hot and steamy, we both haven't had any contact with the other gender since a lot of time, we're making out, clothes come off, and as we start getting down to business, Mike walks in on us in the room.

He's wearing baby clothes, has an apron on, he's holding a FUCKING ladle, he has this surprised look on his face, his hair looks like a Wasp Nest, he even has this sort of black smearing on his face, he's holding some lube and a sandwich, and you know what the asshole says? He goes 'Damn it Chris, What's wrong with you? Just as I get down to fulfilling your Fucking Ladle Fantasy (Jesus knows what that means), you go Hetero on me? I thought you swore you were gay?'

I learnt that laughing in such a Scenario isn't a good idea. She thought the laughing gave it away that I was pranking her. In my defence, it was hilarious seeing him like that.

We both are VERY straight, like literally nothing sexual has ever happened before between us, and the MF does this without the slightest HINT of a smile. Well Maria goes ' I KNEW something was off!' and simply leaves the house, even as I try explaining the shit to her. I'm simply standing there, explaining, Naked, that he's lying, but apparently the lube gave it away, and she's sure I'm messing with her, and if I try contacting her again, she'll call the fucking Police.

So that's how Mike ruined a Hook up, and how a girl thinks I'm a pranking bastard. I swore at him for at least half an hour straight, but that doesn't bring the girl back.

To add insult to the injury, he got the idea from Reddit, of all places.

TL;DR: My roommate walked in on a girl and me about to have sex, he convinced her that I was gay, and I'm lonely again.

Edit: Lots of people are saying there are many loopholes in my story. I'll address the main ones.

1. I'm 16: I dunno where y'all got this from. I noticed a post saying that I was 16 in r/teenagers.

I don't use that sub, and didn't notice. My flair over there had been set long ago. Sorry for that. I've changed it now.

2) The baby clothes: Mike is an acting major, and we both are in the Boston area. By baby clothes I meant clothes that babies wear duh.

3) Now I'm pretty sure the comments saying I was gay are jokes, but I'll clarify: I'm straight, sorry for disappointing y'all.

4) I'm a girl. I know where this one stems from. It's a meme I made. Do people not understand that a meme is a fucking MEME for gods sake? This account is a meme account, majorly. You can dig up my profile and find out that I'm a 45 year old women who came from Mars and occasionally lives in the UK and Zimbabwe while attending classes in Boston. I'll clear this. I'm a student, in an Ivy League University, about to turn 20. I'm a straight guy. Same description applies to Mike. He's majoring in theatre, and I'm majoring in Engineering. We both are tall. He's better looking. He's an extrovert, I'm in the middle you could say.

5) This is fake: I dunno, hard to believe, for sure, definitely not fake. I'm pretty sure the homies saying this is fake are all middle aged people or 14 year olds, who have forgotten how wild college was, or dunno yet how wild it is.

6) The lube: I think that it implied anal, since you need lots of lube for that. Thought it was pretty clear. I misjudged the average IQ of this sub. Sorry

7) Immature of us: Glad you realised

8) Yes we both are friends, very close ones at that. I'll clarify. We share a lot of stuff with each other.

9) We prank each other all the time, together prank others, it's a fun life.

10) I asked where he got the idea from. He got it from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fn67j/i_hear_my_house_mate_masturbating_should_i_walk/c1h5ruf/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3)

I have a past filled with mental health issues, slight trauma, late diagnosed ADHD, relationships where my intimate privacy was hurt multiple times (all of these were long distance and so is the current one, mind you) and the list goes on. I've had and still have my fair share of issues, and I feel like they are making my current relationship crumble in my hands. I love my boyfriend more than anything or anyone and I'd do absolutely anything for him.

I'm constantly afraid my partner has crush someone else, or straight up is cheating on me, or using sexual services of the internet, because I can't give him enough pleasure. Thoughts like this linger in my mind a lot. Especially things related to sexuality and intimacy. We're both quite sexual people and have our pasts with different sorts of adult entertainment, so to say. 

There's been 2 instances where I've gotten deeply hurt and started to doubt him the most. One was when I found out he'd linked himself a gif of a girl masturbating. I ended up confronting him about it, and he opened it up with the statement that it wasn't for him (his friend(s) are fairly perverted,that's what I know) and that he hasn't watched porn since we got together. And as I mentioned it made me feel insecure he told me it's useless for me to compare myself to this girl, because I'm so much more better. 

Another one was when we somehow winded up going through his phone's gallery (he was showing me how to do something during a video call, I think) and besides the usual erotic themed art pieces (this form of erotic art is agreed on by both - we both like it and enjoy it, so I didn't pay too much mind to it despite feeling quite unsure of myself when seeing it), I at least thought I saw a real girl's bare chest. I didn't get to read the folder name, or see how many photos it had, only this. And for a brief moment.

 I got upset and had to muster up courage to ask him to show his gallery again. When I asked, he did ask ""why?"" but did end up picking up his phone. He did mutter to himself while opening his gallery and I'm pretty sure he deleted something, but I'm not sure if it was for convenience or to hide something. Convenience as in ""censor"" the erotic things off with his fingers since he knows I tend to compare myself to them. 

He started going through his entire camera -folder, I'm not really sure why - he went them through for a good moment before I blurted ""oh, but where are the t1ts?"". He got confused what I'm talking about, and I told him to go back to the folders view. I kept going about the t1ts, and he asked if I meant this erotic art folder. I said no.  I remembered under what folder it was under, so I told him that. Here's when I'm sure he deleted a folder, because the folder was obviously different one. There I spotted a folder for gifs with not many images at all, and thought it kind of looks the same - dim picture, t1ts, now more obviously 3D art. 

After this he asked ""you thought I have pictures of random girls' b00bs?"" (I emphatized that what I thought I saw was a real girl's bust) in a pretty neutral (maybe slightly surprised?) tone, and I couldn't lie so I quietly went ""...yeah."" He replied that he doesn't have any other girl's boobs in his gallery other than mine. I think he got upset, as in sad, because for quite some time he kept looking down, looking like he's thinking, but not in a ""hurry, make an excuse!"" way, but rather a ""why --?"" way.  

The conversation moved on to why I think that he would have such things in his gallery all the way to confessing that I don't always trust him (I told I have hard time trusting anyone, and he asked ""me too?""). During this conversations we both had long breaks where we would just stare at something else, both looking down, sometimes at each other. I got surprised he didn't get mad, angry or go mute on me - he never does. I asked about it, and he said that he's not mad because he really loves me and because I explained him where these thoughts come from. I mentioned that it's not his fault but mine, and that also was a reason he wasn't mad, as he expressed it. 

We recovered from this conversation fairly quickly. I was still anxious but I started to joke a little to help the anxiety and he started to smile when I did. He also got happier the more I started to smile. Rest of the call was just calm and normal. When I expressed my shame on talking about such a thing, he said it's important to talk about it because it's harmful to bottle up the emotions. I covered my face while crying but he told me that I don't need to. I told him that I'm sorry and he really went ""for what?"".

Still, even today, I keep thinking about it to the point it's all I think and it keeps making me anxious. Is it just a nagging feeling caused by trust issues or a proper gut feeling? I really can't tell.

We had even planned to meet up, but it didn't work out. When we first met, I stayed the night because we implicitly assumed that it was a (one time) hookup. I got there at like one am and we just talked for a few hours. It was great conversation and there was no sexual tension or awkwardness, it felt like making a new friend. Somehow, we ended up having sex and it was awful for both of us. We were both not sober and he couldn't get hard, and I couldn't stay awake. Right afterwards, he said he wished we hadn't had sex because we could be friends so easily, I take no offense to this because I completely agree. We agreed that that sex didn't count. He said that sex in a friendship was complicated and to a degree, I'd agree but I haven't had experiences like such. He tells me he's going to be out of town for a few months and he was leaving in a few days. I felt like he was lying, but he wasn't. Before he left, I saw him again and we had sex, it was better kinda. Once he left, he made an effort to text me everyday and I told him he shouldn't feel obligated to because I'd see him and still hookup with him when he came back regardless of us having casual text conversations. He said that he didn't feel obligated to and that he actually likes talking to me. I felt so shocked because I've never had this situation happen. I never say that obligation thing to guys because my past friends with benefits never casually talked to me, and my past hookups were kinda douchey.

He thinks I see him as solely sex, but he sees me as something more. I don't even like the sex too much, it was honestly kinda surprisingly not good. He even called himself prey and agreed that I was a succubus. When I'm nice to him, he points it out and it makes me feel like a total cornball.

I'm supposed to see him this month because he's coming back. I don't know how to show him or tell him that I care. When I tell him I care, it's always implicit because I'm too embarrassed to admit it, I don't want him to take advantage of me caring. Because of this, he doesn't think I care.

So basically, my girlfriend and I have never been super duper sexually intimate, and lately, it’s started to severely depress me.

We usually have sex maybe once every three months. We both work full time, and while I’m usually fine and up for intimacy, she’s usually pretty tired and ends up sleeping or plays video games until she falls asleep. We do cuddle, we do kiss, we sometimes shower together, we’re very comfortable around each other and I love her a lot. But the sex just isn’t there for us. 

Yesterday, I was joking around/conversing with her whilst slightly tipsy, and asking her if she likes having sex with me. She said that she does enjoy it, but she prefers to cuddle over sex. She also said that I make her feel like a prude whenever I talk about us not having sex often. That bummed me out pretty hard and honestly sobered me up a bit, but I always will respect that and I then apologized. So I dropped the conversation.

Another time, I had a very intense, upfront conversation with her about us not having sex often. It became this whole thing about me “not finding her attractive” which never has been the case at all. She was sobbing, which made me cry, a big mess. So once again, I ended up dropping the conversation because it was starting to spiral into this whole self-depreciating episode on her part, and I just wanted it to stop.

Every single time we have these conversations, she attempts to make up for it by making out with me or trying to engage in intimacy later on in the day, but I find it incredibly uncomfortable and forced, considering the fact that she only does it after I bring up the issue.

Don’t get me wrong, she’s a very sweet and loving person and we spend a ton of fun and exciting time together outside of sex, but I don’t think she likes sex as much as I do and I think she gets offended/afraid when I say it to her. This is also my first relationship, and I’ve voiced to her numerous times. I’m just someone who enjoys sex and thinks it’s important in our relationship.

I don’t really know what to do at this point. Every time I talk about it, I end up looking like the bad person who’s only concerned about sex and her physical attractiveness. But that’s not my agenda at all. Should I break up with her, or take a break or talk to her again? I’ve been extremely open about it already but it seems it’s not exactly fixing anything. I just hate conflict and it seems like that’s all my attempts lead to.

tl;dr: My girlfriend and I barely have sex, and it makes me feel really depressed about our relationship. I spoken to her about it before and the conversations never go well. She says that I make her feel like a prude when I bring up the health of our sex life, and stuff along those lines. She also says that when it comes to us being physical, she prefers to cuddle instead of sex.

We were at one of those checkout lanes that have little shelf’s full of random crap. Well I saw a bag of sugar free lifesaver mints. I absolutely loved those kind of mints, but whenever I got them, they weren’t sugar free. I got two bags.

As me and my parents were going to other stores, I’d take a handful of mints and eat them while we were walking around. Eventually I had eaten a whole bag.

For you more clever readers, you may know that sugar free candys can act as a laxative, my dumbass forgot about this important fact.

When we got home, I remember feeling gassy, of corse I only got gassy when I was about to poop.

I sat on the toilet, had a normal poop and continued with my night.

But then I felt it again, and it was worse, thriving pain in my gut, I felt a rush of liquid in my stomach. I ran to the toilet, and once I sat down, it was like a full on bodily evacuation of fluids. All being held in by a solid poop plug.

As soon as I had turned into a pressure washer, my guts writhed in pain, basically pushing out everything it could as fast as possible.

For a bit of context, when I get “the runs” i shit once, feel fine, I clean up, go back to what I was doing, then it all comes back and I’m on the toilet again.

This was the same, except i had about 5 min to chug a glass of water and immediately go upstairs. Repeat this 5 times and you can imagine the pain I was in. The last time I had to go, it was awful, full body shakes, a fucking geyser is coming out my ass, as soon as it was over, I crawled to my shower, turned it on and just sat there, exhausted, processing everything I ate that day, wondering what the fuck I ate, then it hit me:

Those

Fucking 

Mints

I washed up, got a new change of clothes and waddled to the other bag of mints, I read the back, and of corse, in big letters on the back, “WARNING, EATING EXCESS OF THIS PRODUCT MAY ACT AS A LAXATIVE!”

I read this as I sat there, sweating, eyes sunken in, white as a sheet of paper, knowing how truly stupid I was, especially since I heard about the cursed gummy bears.

So now I lay in bed, exhausted, cursing death on the dumbasses who thought putting things in candy that act as a laxative would be a good idea.

TL;DR: I ate too much sugar free mints (which act as a laxative) and I shit like a geyser for three hours, only to find out the mints literally tell you they act as a laxative.",0,0,tifu,t5_2to41,nsfw,TIFU by eating sugar free mints,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/kopn2h/tifu_by_eating_sugar_free_mints/,promo_adult_nsfw,21.5

I had no sexual experience whatsoever and clarified we would stay nonsexual for the whole hangout. We met and didn't do anything sexual, he wanted to meet a second time and we eventually did. Somehow I was comfortable enough and I lost my virginity to him. For two months we had a pretty consistent schedule of meeting up weekly to have sex. We wouldn't text at all except to schedule these meetings, before having sex we used to have casual text conversations often. I was completely fine with the lack of conversation since we saw each other weekly and talked then. He'd often say that we were friends, but I told him I saw him more like an acquaintance because I felt no actual friendship. When we spoke it was jokes or just mandated pre-sex ""Hey how was your week?"" conversation. He left in August and we saw each other for one last time. During the last time I saw him,  I accidentally broke my necklace in his car and he promised to give it back when he'd return during the holidays. It was already past Thanksgiving and he hadn't reached out to me. I reached out and he took really long to reply to me, at one point he took ten days to reply to one of my texts. It felt very insincere because I just wanted my necklace back, I'm not even asking to have sex and I'm sure he'd appreciate the sex more than me anyways. At one point he didn't reply at all and he was always active on instagram, watching my stories and liking my posts within the first hour of it being posted. I put on my story ""if you're reading this and you have my necklace, fuck you."" He swiped up and said he'd see me the next week, the same thing he'd told me five weeks prior (the replies took this long and the ratio of texts back and forth was 1:1). During the period which he was gone I met someone who I had casual sex with twice. This guy texted me consistently and I told him he shouldn't obligated to because this first friends with benefits never casually texted me and I was fine with it. This new guy said he actually enjoyed talking to me. It shocked me and I felt hurt by the guy who took my virginity never contacting me like he used to before we had sex. Finally, my friends with benefits came back and I told him off the bat that I felt used and explained why. He laughed at me and I basically had to ask him for an apology instead of him just apologizing by initiative. I told him to not expect us to hook up this time because he made me feel bad about myself and he said he didn't expect us to have sex anyways. I found this hard to believe since that was our entire dynamic and we had sex every time we saw each other. Eventually, he convinced me to give him a blowjob and I agreed since I just wanted to be fingered and explicitly said I didn't plan to have sex with him that day. He told me to blow him before fingering me and he finished. He fingered me and I told him it wasn't enough and that I changed my mind and wanted to have sex. He made me beg for it (which is out of character for me) just for him to tell me that he didn't have time to have sex. I told him I felt even more used and humiliated. We were in his car on the way to drop me off and he asked me if I felt used and was surprised when I nodded as if I hadn't discussed it multiple times with him in the past three hours. I gave him the silent treatment throughout the car ride and couldn't look him in the eye, even teared up out of feeling weak and disgusted by how I let him treat me. He parked and I was grabbing my stuff to leave the car and he very firmly and forcefully grabbed my arm so I couldn't leave. He tried to convince me to not be mad and it half worked but in the end I still told him I was mad over how I felt. He told me he expects to see me again before he leaves. I feel incredibly used and dirty. I know he's treating me badly but I don't want to end on bad terms with the guy who took my virginity. Is it irrational for me to feel the way I feel?

My (28f) boyfriend (28M) and I have been dating for over a year and we really love each other and have been a rock for each other especially because we live in an area that has been almost completely locked down since March of last year (no shops, I haven't seen any of my friends in person for almost a year, haven't been anywhere besides my place or his since last summer). Up until very recently (the last month or so) we have had an amazing sex life. For me, consistent good sex is really important to my relationships and I've ended relationships in the past because we didn't have good sexual energy. When I started seeing my bf, our sexual energy was off the charts and all our kinks lined up perfectly. We worshipped each other, our bodies, and the energy never seemed to slow down. I've never been in a relationship before that had such consistently awesome sex and for the first time I didn't feel self-conscious that I wanted sex more than my romantic partner (something particularly touchy for me as a woman). 

However, in the past month our sex has completely and utterly dried up. We went from having sex at least every day we were together to not having sex for an entire month. Now looking back at the sex we did have at the start of the month, it seems like he wasn't really into it. When I asked him at the time, he said he was stressed from work and I believed it (I still do). It's also been really difficult during the pandemic with our situation, everything is and has been completely shut down and at this point everyone feels so worn down and overwhelmed with apathy, I totally feel that too. 

But not having sex is starting doing all these uncomfortable things to my brain about our relationship and I don't really know what to do. I've tried doing things he really likes in bed to cheer him up to no response and at this point I've just given up because I'm tired and hurt by being rejected constantly. In my past relationships, when I've stopped having sex with my partner it's signaled the end of the relationship because I've stopped wanting to be close with that person. I've also started feeling really low about my body, I'm not concerned with being attractive all the time but I love clothes and not getting dressed for work every day had already impacted my self esteem and now without the closeness and admiration of my body that he gives me when we have sex, I'm feeling even more low and gross and completely unwanted. 

We've talked about it a lot and he just tells me that he doesn't feel sexy, which I totally get. Everything is locked down and I've known him for a long time (childhood friends) so I absolutely know it's not something like cheating and like I said, I fully believe it's because he's low. He's also told me that he hasn't been masturbating at all either, he said he just doesn't feel a drop of sexual energy. I don't want to force him into sex at all, I want him to feel that he wants to be with me. I know sex isn't important to everyone in a relationship, but I've been really clear from the beginning that it is with me. At the end of the day, I really love him and I want to be close to him in a way we only get through sex. It's getting to the point where I feel like a crazy horny lady and feeling really down when I see him and honestly I'm just at a lost. I know I can't be happy in a relationship without sex but I love my bf dearly and know he's going through a rough time and don't want to break up with him but the longer we go without having sex the more distant and weird I feel.

So some background, I use to be a loner and just the fat friend everybody liked to have, I was huge (428 pounds), and I never really had a gf before and I completely understand why. I was really big and that doesn’t really translate to being attractive. So I lose a lot of weight after I get a stomach surgery and to make a long story short I have a girlfriend now. That bit of confidence I gained after the surgery pushed me to be more social and get the courage to ask someone out. I’ve been going out with my gf for a bit over two months. She’s dated other people, but I was an inexperienced virgin when she met me. Luckily that changed but I still feel new to everything and I constantly have it in my head that I’m not enough and I’m not good at anything that I do. Who would have thought that for being obese and unhealthy for 99% of my life would finally affect me physically and mentally when I finally end up with someone I really like. The thing is though too is that she’s like really good to me and is always patient and caring and I don’t know what to do because I don’t bring anything in to the relationship. I’m still trying to finish my degree, she’s already has a bachelors. I’m still struggling with my shitty job, and she’s doing great for herself at hers. I’d like to think I’m nice and funny but what the hell does that do for anyone. I feel completely inadequate compared to her.
She wants to do all this sexy stuff in the bedroom I don’t know how to do and I can’t even last for more than 5 mins. She tells me I’m the person who’s treated her the best and has never felt better with anyone she’s ever been with but Idk sometimes I feel like she just settled for me because she was tired of dating. I can’t stop thinking that she probably has had way better sexual partners then me and it is absolutely killing me. I don’t feel man enough and I completely blame myself and my inexperience.

I (25M) and my wife ( 24F) have been together for 5 years. I cannot overstate how much I love her, she truly is my priority in life. She’s the best friend I ever had. But we've had sex-related issues for some time and we've been largely ignoring it. I feel more and more disgusted about myself, shifting between thinking I'm an asshole, sexist, broken, and worthless. I want this to get better, but I have no idea where to turn.

To describe the problem , I must say it has gotten worse. In our first couple of years, we'd have less sex than I wanted, but when we did it, it was great. However, recently it has gotten so bad that the last two times I just gave up in the middle of the act. I cannot diagnose the problem, only relay what my brain perceives, but I think I might be primarily at fault in this whole thing. I'm a neurotic guy, and I suspect my psychology might be playing tricks on me. I just know I have grown insecure and I feel so ashamed all the time. I don't even want my wife to see my penis anymore. It’s ridiculous, but I thought about cutting it off in moments of intense shame and frustration.  

It all started with the realization, early on, that my wife never initiated sex. I'm not saying she never initiated penetration. She has never, in any way, performed any sexual advances on me. No teasing me; no touching me in sexual ways; no dirty talk; not even dressing/undressing in an overtly sexy way. I never wanted to tell my wife what to do with her body, so I just told her I liked those things. She said she didn't know how to do it, and never really tried. But then, a certain pattern in our sex acts started to solidify: I was in charge of sex. She wanted it, at least she would tell me so. But she would just lay on the bed and wait me to tell her what to do. Of course, I wanted her to cum, but she wouldn't tell me what she liked, at all. Even when I asked directly, she would just say ""I don't know, I like everything we do"" . So I would eat her pussy, eat her ass, play with toys, tie her up, make things about her. She cums more often than I do and really likes all that stuff. I thought this would make her more comfortable with her sexuality and she would feel freer to *get more involved* (for lack of a better term). But over the years the opposite has happened, she has become increasingly *accommodated.* When I signal to her I want to have sex, she just lays there as if her pussy and body were just objects. She expects me to do everything, and I honestly feel like a glorified vibrator.

I feel like a sexist.

She does do things ""for me"" in sex, like blowing me or jerking me off. But only if I --clearly and verbally-- ask her to. And It feels like she doesn't want to, she just wants to make me ""be done""; It's out of guilt. She might do it for 2 or 3 minutes and then she'll either say her jaw/arm is tired, or say she doesn't know how to do it properly. I understand those issues but, if she really wanted to do it, she could search for some reference or at least try new things. It's just clear to my eyes that she does not desire my body. This sounds so douchey to say, but I am in really good shape, and I get a fair amount of attention from women. This information is just to say that it's not because I gained weight or stopped taking care of myself. I'm also very hygienic, showering once or twice a day, I make sure it's always clean down there. I keep asking myself if I'm being sexist, women must go through this situation all the time. Am I expecting too much of her? Am I brainwashed by porn to expect that women will be enthusiastic to pleasure a guy? Am I imposing my conception of sexuality on her? I don't know. It just feels like she has no urge to have sex *with me*, she only wants to cum and that’s it. When I ask her to “help me out”, it feels like she’s doing me a favor. 

I feel like an asshole. 

My wife is not just any woman. She has a lot of psychological attributes and trauma that relate to this situation. First, she has very fragile self-esteem. Therefore, It is really hard for me to bring up any of these issues. When I do it in a very nice, sugar-coated manner, she brushes off my qualms with deflections, or pointing out anecdotes of when the issue I’m bringing up didn’t happen. The “what about that one time” or “this doesn’t happen every time” type of response.  When I’m assertive about how I feel, she immediately turns it towards herself. She starts yelling that she’s a piece of shit or the worst wife in really insincere ways. I can’t bring any criticism about her behavior because she thinks I’m saying the behavior is who she is. For example, if I say she’s done something hurtful to me, she’ll act as though I said she’s a hurtful person. But she always blames herself in a way that strips her from responsibility. Like “that thing you don’t like, that’s just who I am. Why do you even love me? I ruined your life”. Her reaction always presupposes she could never change her behavior, no matter how trivial.  I’ve grown so cautious that I mostly just suck it up, and my feelings are only expressed when I’m in moments of extreme frustration, which doesn’t help.

But here’s why I can’t shake the feeling that I’m a giant monster in this entire situation: my wife was molested as a child. So was I, but her case was much more traumatic. It’s horrible to think, she’s probably scarred and I’m here asking her to overcome her past willy-nilly. But how could I know how to deal with this? I’ve offered to pay for her to see a therapist, but she says it’s a waste of money.  I’ve tried talking to her about all these issues. She says she wants to communicate, but when I try she just keeps saying “I don’t know what to say”. Even if I reassure her that there’s no “right answer” ( I just want to understand what goes through her head) she still says “I don’t know”. It has been driving me to question every part of our sexual relationship, because she just won’t share her thoughts with me. People block and repress a lot of stuff, but I can’t help but feel trapped. She won’t talk to me but refuses to talk to a professional. Even when I tell her to talk to her friends about it, she says they never talk about sex. I’m lost, nowhere to turn to. I can’t even gage if I’m the one who’s been unreasonable this whole time. Am I making her trauma about me? Am I rushing her to overcome it? Am I horrible for even assuming she can or should change? Should I accept her entirely without wanting her to change? 

I feel like I’m broken.

I have become pathetic. That’s the only word that comes to mind when I try to describe myself.  I’m horny every day, but I can’t bring myself to initiate sex. I’m becoming insecure about my body. My penis genuinely looks smaller and sad. I have dreams where she’s cheating on me. I have dreams where she’s left me. For the first time in my life, I started crying sometimes after masturbating. Last night we tried again. I told her I wanted to do it later, so she’d be prepared.   When I was waiting in bed, She came from the bathroom with a giant baggy t-shirt, her eyes almost closed.  She lays in bed under the blankets, and looks at me like “ok , go ahead”. I was immediately turned off. We just talked about being more active last week. I start kissing her, and she literally does not move from her position. Even when I try to remove her shirt, she just lays there. I just couldn’t do it. She could tell and started crying. And then I did. It almost feels like I’m raping some unwilling arranged-marriage type wife. The only thought in my head was that I wanted to go outside and jump into traffic.  Why couldn’t I just do it? Isn’t that what all guys want: A girl who will do it whenever they want it, and won’t even ask for anything? I felt gross for hurting her. I felt gross for not satisfying her sexually. I felt ashamed of pretending I am a “real man”. I know this association is toxic masculinity speaking, but how can I abandon the feeling that I am broken? I feel like, despite our progressive ideals, she and everyone else expects me to have no complexity to my sexuality. To be a grunt who just wants to smash and that’s it. My feelings only matter to others when I cry or scream, stating them is like I never said anything at all.  

I need advice. I need help. I don’t know what to do.  Can anyone offer some course of action? I‘m afraid I might do something regretful. Last week I had an episode and just went to the bathroom and shaved my entire head, I don’t know why I did it. I just don’t want my next manifestation to be more than just hair.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for about a year now and I've been thinking about breaking up with him. I would describe him as a typical ""funny guy"", someone who always wants the attention on him. He acts really childish and I don't think that our relationship is working.

Since he has to live back at home with his parents because of Covid, he asks to come over a lot since I live with housemates. Recently I keep telling him that I'm busy, but in reality, I don't want him to come over because I know that he'll just want to have sex. There were many times where I've told him that I didn't want to, but then he would just keep asking every 10 minutes until I reluctantly said okay. I've had a couple of serious talks with him about how this makes me feel uncomfortable and that I only said yes because he was annoying me and didn't take my initial no for an answer. He said that he understood, but even after our talks he still pressures me when he sleeps over.

This has bothered me to the point where I just feel really stressed about sex. He's never yelled at me or hit me, but I don't think that this is a healthy relationship. I want to talk to him about not wanting to have sex anymore, but I don't think he'll really understand because our relationship started off as FWB.

It started when i was really young, i wasn’t allowed on any school trips or to stay over at any friends house because she feared i’d be molested or taken. She obviously never said that to me at the time or never even but as i grew older i realised after it became a pattern. She told me the reason why i wasn’t allowed was because i couldn’t keep a secret and that i’d tell everyone our family secrets and at the time i believed her. To sum it up she basically ruined my childhood 

When i was around 8 or 10 i complained to my mum that there were webs or strings in my private parts i was so young that i didn’t know my body so i wasn’t being clear but my mam took that as i was molested. she brought me to the doctor to have my hymen checked it wasn’t a good memory and i don’t think i liked what was going on. I had my mam bring me to the doctor on different occasions to have a pregnancy test anytime i complained of stomach pain. Sometimes it was at home. This all happened when i was around 15-17. 

When i was 18 my mum moved back home while my dad visited her couple times a year leaving me mostly independent. I practically lived alone with my siblings for 5 years. One time my mum came home for 2 weeks i was going out for my friends birthday and she began interrogating me i told her im 23 years of age this is all too much she didn’t take it too well. She basically threatened to throw me out. I was stress drinking that night and got too drunk i woke up with an insane hangover. My mum began yelling first thing in the morning and hit me on the head while i was in bed started screaming across the house saying i could be raped but how would she know since i didn’t tell her where i was last night.

Im 24 now and i decided to move over to my parents because one of my brothers was really abusive towards me. Well my mum and i had a really good relationship for a year (mostly through text) which made me forget the type of person she is normally our relationship wouldn’t be the best.  Well i moved over with positive thoughts but was met with a control freak who is telling me to be careful that people here kidnap. I’ve asked close family friends that live here and they’ve informed me that kidnap is not that common here.

Me being completely done with her behaviour i decided to tell her how she treated me throughout my life and she gaslighted me insulted me and told me i’m ungrateful that what other parent would care for her child like she does. Im completely at awe and don’t know what to do.

We’ve been together for 2 years and have lived together for 1.5 years. This only became an issue about a year ago. I’ve never experienced this kind of jealousy with a previous partner. I have talked to him about this issue to see if he had any insight as to what we could do to solve the issue. I would never ask him not to masturbate, I just need advice on how to deal with my own feelings and come to peace with the situation. 

His masturbation is seldom and in no way interferes with our sex life, so intellectually I know that I have no real reason to feel this way. We have sex on average 5 times a week which we are both happy with. I’m even more confused due to the fact that I masturbate much more often than he does. 

At the beginning of our relationship, we lived in a tiny studio and would only mutually masturbate together. Or sometimes even 69 + porn. So maybe it’s due to feeling left out of an activity we used to share together? 

This started becoming an issue when we moved into our one bedroom apartment and we started going to bed at different times (I generally go to sleep earlier). I would end up laying awake at night obsessing over whether he was taking the opportunity to jerk off. Eventually I told him about my strange obsession. He suggested I ask him if he’s going to jerk off before I go to bed if it’s bothering me. I started doing that and he would always answer me honestly. It seemed that it helped knowing concretely one way or the other. This slowly became less of an issue and I haven’t had to ask him in a couple months.  

However if there’s a situation in which I think he’s going to jerk off, it will still eat at me. I find myself wondering what kind of porn he’s watching etc. I don’t know why I’m so curious. Maybe it’s some voyeuristic fascination. I don’t know. Or it could be coming from a controlling place? 

Anyway, I’d love to hear people’s thoughts and suggestions. If anyone relates, I’d love to hear what sorts of things worked for you. I’m guessing it’ll just be a slow re-framing of my thinking. 

TLDR: I get extremely jealous when my boyfriend jerks off. So much so that it keeps me awake at night sometimes.

So, we started talking online for a while and had a whole FWB situation, she's got a husband and he's cool with it DW. It escalated to her liking me romatically and me being the genuis that i am, i was like ""Eh i feel the same but i'm not sure if it's platonic or romantic love"" It escalated and we're around 3 months into our relationship. And i said the relationship isn't gonna be long term because it's technically poly.

A few issues came up when since she has a husband, she doesn't do much with him (In general, not  sexually) and they only really speak when they have dinner together. I'm feeling bad about that, even when he proposed to open the relationship because she was talking about me a lot.

And that she said she'd be hurt if i wanted to have a sexual encounter with someone, yet she has a husband. We did talk this through and it was left open ended.

It's stagnated and i feel very drained around her now, she hasn't done ANYTHING wrong in this situation but both my sexual attraction to her is dwindling and i have to abstain for a good few days to actually feel attracted. My feelings weren't really that high compared to hers and i feel absolutely awful, because all i wanted to do is make her happy and i've both put myself and her in a bit of a shit spot.

Because i wanted to take some time to myself and chill with a few friends (Online ofc because covid), and i feel like going back to call her or anything feels like a chore more than anything else.

Then later on, me and a friend were talking, we were pretty close and then she admitted that she feels romantically towards me. And it sent my heart through the roof combined with the whole cliche'd ""Butterflies feeling"" I told her that i have a GF  and that i'm not available because i'm not a scumbag, but now it's kinda confirming feelings i already had about the relationship.

Being that i wasn't intending for anything long term, especially with the polyamory thing, and now this has happened. I'm not sure what to do in this situation, because her feelings towards me have been WAY more intense than mine, and i think i love her, but it's incredibly dull and the polyam thing is also something that i stated will probably make the relationship short term.

I didn't make any big future plans other than her coming to my country to visit me. But i feel like an absolute dick, even though i haven't done anything wrong and that i can't control how i feel. But i can imagine her crying and being so upset at a breakup and it makes my heart break in two.

We have  been together for almost a decade, and throughout our relationship a  lot of things have come to light in regard to his sexuality. He has been  discovering a lot things about his sexuality and has clearly felt  unsure about sharing the details with me, as I know he is still  processing a lot of things for himself over time. I am happy he is  coming into his own and is very slowly feeling more comfortable about  being open about things he knows he wants or likes. The issue really is  that he does not express anything to me unless I (kindly) drag it out of him or I catch  him in an act or stumble across things on his phone or our computer,  etc. I have always given him the benefit of the doubt and have tried to  be as understanding as possible.  I found out he enjoys cross dressing  (by stumbling upon his clothes), and have continually found sex toys, explicit images he takes of himself and saves of others that he was not  sharing with me, and now I accidentally found (we sometimes share a computer) an email address he has apparently been using to send himself  images of teen women he finds attractive and also women in his  day-to-day life he has been snapping photos of and sending them to  himself.

I really don't want to  invade his privacy by telling him I found these images and emails as I  know sexuality and self-discovery is very complicated and sensitive, but  I can't help but feel left out, confused, and overlooked. Is this  something I should just let go and wait for him to come to me? For  context, we don't have a very active sex life and he has cited that its  partly due to things he finds attractive that I don't really partake in  (lots of preening, manicures, dyed hair, tattoos, sexy clothes, etc). I  have always felt that I wasn't 'sexy enough' or 'good enough' with him  where in the past that was never really an issue I had with other  partners. I love him to pieces because he is so supportive of mental  health issues I have been struggling with, but I also don't want my  judgement to be clouded by feeling I 'owe' him for being supportive of  me... I am just confused and really don't want to be insensitive here.  If you need or want more context I am happy to provide, just looking for  some advice. And again, to be clear, I have never snooped deliberately,  all of these findings were truly accidental.

**trigger warning - swearing, self harm, domestic violence**

**Admins please delete if not appropriate**

I'm really puzzled about this part of my experience the last 24 hours. 

I went to the ER because I have been having a really tough time. My life is a real mess. And I'm worried that I've fu**ed everything up.

I've become a carbon copy of my abusive father and I hate it. My own self hatred, shame and anger are just out of control. I lashed out at my partner and lost control of my own feelings. 

I had a panic attack thinking my partner doesn't love me and want me. I took knives out of the knife block in the kitchen &amp; held onto a computer charger thinking of the ways I could use it. But I didn't act on them. I ended up throwing a bunch of furniture on the floor and shouting at my partner and a friend after they came back from being out of the house. I just curled up in a ball and cried trying to make my brain stop. I had thoughts of ending it. 

My partner called the police and I was taken to hospital. 

I spent the night there sitting in the waiting room, nurses checking on me every few hours. I didn't sleep much at all in the crappy uncomfortable chairs. I was there well into the next day. I missed work and waited around for the psychological services to see me. I met with a psychiatrist and had a talk about everything that was going on. I was probably not as truthful talking to this doctor due to the nature of my relationship and out of respect for my partner, no one wants to air their dirty laundry.  

He proceeded to tell me that he didn't think I had ADHD (A well established and diagnosed condition of mine). And that my issues were just 'long term depression' picked up in childhood and that my relationship issues are the biggest stressor. I'll admit that I'm not the most well adjusted person after going through some of the shit I have growing up. But how can you un-diagnose someone when clearly a treatment works for them? And they didn't speak to my partner about what went on or what may have triggered me. 

After the hospital updated my partner on what they thought about my condition, I called her and we spoke for a bit about us. This is my very last chance. And I'm seriously sad and worried about it. 

The police have advised her to put a violence order in place due to the fact that she doesn't feel safe with me around and that we have kids and she is pregnant. They would have put one in place automatically if I had broken any of the furniture that I threw on the floor. 

We have already organised some couples counselling before this happened and I'm also about to start a program for abusive partners (organised before this occurred). I would not ever hurt any of my family in anger. I've been emotionally abusive and have used ADHD as a bit of my victim mentality. I understand she doesn't feel safe around me. I came home and have booked an appointment to see my regular Psychiatrist and Doctor to see what they say. How and what do I do in the meantime?

She had an even worse night than me, anxious, shaking and scared. She had to take some medication to reduce her anxiety. My daughter woke up super confused that Dad wasn't there and my step daughter came home asking where I was and why my car was still at home when I should be at work. 

I'm still trying to process everything that's gone on. I know that some of you may judge but I am trying to be honest with myself and sort this out while it's a small problem. 

I feel shit about myself. Shit about all the missed opportunities that I've had that I didn't take because it was the easy option. Because I didn't get the endorphins from them. 

I don't know if this is the right place to put this but I needed somewhere to express myself. I think I've hit rock bottom. And I hope I can make positive change and get all of this sorted out.

I need help. I’m feeling so alone.

I (32F) and my partner (27m) have been together for going on 6 years now. Our finances, families, friends, possessions are all blended. I love him, and everything’s great EXCEPT we haven’t had much of a sex life in 4 years. I’ve tried doing sexy things to come onto him (waxing and plucking the hell out of myself, sexy underwear, I work out, I’m a reasonably attractive person). None of these things have worked, I just get rejected in new and increasingly frustrating ways. To be clear, we have sex 2-3 times a month (on average, I track it). I know that might be enough for a lot of people, but maybe I have a high libido. My partner simply does NOT, and he has also mentioned that 2 previous relationships of his ended because his GFs said they wanted more sex than he did, so I know this is ongoing with him. He always acts like sex is a chore: he’s too tired, too busy, whatever. The answer is ALWAYS “no” when I try to initiate, so the times we do have sex are always his choice. I’m just getting so down about it, I feel 0% sexy, and honestly at this point I’m having a hard time even masturbating because I just don’t feel desirable at all. I’m not sure how to “get my groove back”, as it were, or if I ever will. It’s getting to the point that I resent him mostly all the time, and I don’t even want to have sex with him anymore. I’m now rejecting him when he occasionally tries, maybe to have some power over the situation, or maybe because if you get rejected every.single.time. you ask, or beg, for YEARS, it gets really hard to believe someone actually wants you ever. The other thing is the quality of sex, it’s just 5ish mins of straight P in V sex, no foreplay, fingers do not even touch my pussy, nothing, and then I have to force him to cuddle after. He acts like he just did me a huge favor and is ready to be fawned over, but I don’t get any affection. In fact, he’s often grumpy after, like he earned some “him” time by giving me what I wanted. It’s insanely depressing. I haven’t gotten head in 3 years, and then it was something I had to ask for, for my birthday. I’ve asked for it every birthday since then, but it just hasn’t happened. And again, if someone is so averse to eating my pussy I don’t really want them to after a while. I’ve begged to give him head, but he says it’s “gross” and won’t allow it. We have at least one huge blow-out fight over lack of sex a year, and then he usually tries a bit harder for a few months, but it always goes back to 1-3ish quickies p/month. We also work opposite schedules right now, he’s working graveyards so obviously he really is always tired, and that has made things a lot worse. I don’t want to be a bad, overly-demanding partner, but when you’re deprived of sex for years it’s really, really hard to be understanding. Like, I am so f\*\*\*\*\*\* desperate, I’m pretty worried I’ll end up cheating on him if anyone ever shows interest in me physically (not likely now due to WFH and lockdown, but it could happen someday).

To bring this back, I love him. I love his personality, we have so much else in common. He takes care of me in every other aspect of life, and I take care of him and I want to be the one that does that. We’re complimentary in many ways, my family loves him and his family loves me. His father is getting a divorce right now, and everyone seems eager to see my partner and I get married and make things official (his little sister especially, who is a kid that’s currently dealing with her own parents’ divorce. I love her a whole lot, and I’d love to give her that certainty that her bro and I will stay together, but I can’t). Over the holidays, his mother and step-mother have both asked me why we’re not married yet. It’s soul-crushing trying to lie to everyone about how we’re just not that interested in marriage and domestic partnership works for us, but I don’t think I’ve been that believable. Obviously, I can’t say to anyone “he never wants to do me and touches me maybe a few times a week for hugs and stuff, so I can’t marry him if we don’t have a sex life”. My partner and I have discussed the fact that the continuous strife over our sex life is the thing that gives us both the biggest doubts about the longevity of our relationship, it’s basically the ONLY thing we fight over.

When I laid this all out for my therapist she said, “it sounds like it may be time to move on from this relationship”. And I know that’s probably the answer I’ll get here, I’ve read through posts on r/deadbedrooms. But I love him SO MUCH. And is sex really a good enough reason to leave this whole life we’ve built together? We have everything right now, everything except sex. Everyone thinks we’re a perfect couple. How can I just blow up my home for sex. Does even considering it make me a bad person? I need to stop resenting him, it’s just destroying my mental health. How to do that? Please help.

So a little less than a year ago I (F15) was in a relationship with a guy (M15). He was nice and I had known him for a couple months.  We had a mutual friend group, and looking back he had definitely made a few provocative jokes. At the time I didn't really think much of it, I was a tomboyish girl (which apparently made me seem approachable to guys) in an all male friend group and the topic of sex definitely came up more than once. We got together after a little while, which raised a bit of red flags that I didn't see back then (ie putting his hand on my thigh, and sort of moving it up towards my crotch, even when i moved his had back down, asking how fast i wanted the relationship to go in an extremely condescending tone, making jokes about us having sex in general, etc) So, being a 15 year old girl with anxiety (please note that this was my first relationship and his like 5th one) I quickly noped out of that. It still feels kind of bad to say but i basically ghosted him for a month or so. When i had complained about him messaging me one too many times, my parents sat me down and tried to figure out why he was doing this. I told them that he asked me out and i panicked and said yes, without including anything about the sex. and they basically scolded me for ghosting him and leading him on. now being months later, it has basically turned into a giant ball of anxiety into my head.

My life is soon going to get a little less good. I don't really want to post the details all over the internet but it essentially means that even as an adult I won't have much control in my life. I won't be able to hang out with my friends or choose when to leave the house or do anything spontaneous, wild, fun. There are worse cases to be in and I sound like a spoilt, dramatic BRAT. But that doesn't mean I can make myself decide to be happy or stop being so damned resentful. The anger and hurt and the loss of freedom burns me up. I'm not okay or happy enough to want life and I won't be for a very, very long time. Good chance I won't be until I die and that's just the truth. 

There's no point in asking advice because everyone just says to leave or go no contact and I don't want to do that - I'd literally rather die. Maybe in the future, but I can't right now. I am TRAPPED in a situation I have zero control over. I feel like a zoo lion, pacing it's cage and ready to rip out the bars. All I feel nowadays is anger and dread and stress and hurt and a whole lot of self-pity. Except for the times I can forget it by mindlessly scrolling through social media or something but that's not true happiness. If that's the best I can get to being okay, then man I am wasting my life and potential. It's depressing to know that only forgetting briefly brings peace.

How the hell do I accept this as the way my life is destined? How do I become happy with this or at least content enough to survive? Generations and generations of people before me, especially women, have suffered a fate that they didn't deserve but had to do. Generations of people after me will go through the same thing. They didn't all just end themselves. How did they learn to bear with life despite knowing it never gets better. 

What am I missing? Am I ungrateful? Not resilient enough? Wanting too much? Not realizing how much better off I am than others? Way too emotional?

So I (23F) recently moved in with my boyfriend (26M). Between work, school, and getting adjusted I’ve been super tired. My boyfriend and I work completely opposite work schedules. He works early mornings, I work evenings. So needless to say our sex life has been non existent. 

He mentioned it today and I thought it would be nice to end out celibacy. So as we were getting ready for bed I rolled over and kissed him. Skip forward and we were doing the do. Now let me preface this by I feel nauseous 24/7 due to underlying conditions. I rarely ever actually throw up. 

So I’m feeling nauseous but I’m like it’s normal. Well we’re in doggy style and I just start projectile vomiting all over the bed. It took my boyfriend a moment to realize that I was throwing up and he jumped up and grabbed the towel. He just stood there and stared at me. 

He disappeared into the bathroom for 15 minutes while I cleaned up, completely mortified. We’re now in bed not saying a word, he trying to go to sleep for work. I’m super embarrassed and am looking forward to not having to face this until later on tomorrow when I can process it further lol. 

TL;DR I ignored my nauseas, ending up vomiting all over the bed during sex and potentially traumatizing my partner.

Edit: First thank you guys so much. I’m glad my horrific experience has awarded me my first awards and most upvoted post lol. I just want to state that my boyfriend and I have been together for 7 years. We had been long distance for awhile. All of these health problems started while I was gone. Before that neither of us got sick so we haven’t seen this side of each other yet (better late than never right lol). I’ve never asked him how he feels about throw up but he looked traumatized. He’s normally a very caring person I think I caught him by surprise. We’ll probably talk about it and laugh later but both of us are people who need time to process before speaking and I will allow him his time.",1,0,tifu,t5_2to41,nsfw,TIFU by having sex with my boyfriend when I was nauseous,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/l8g2og/tifu_by_having_sex_with_my_boyfriend_when_i_was/,promo_adult_nsfw,3682.0

Penis and XY chromosome is boy and Vagina and XX chromosome is girl.

Then there are those who differentiate these two words. Sex is that physical aspect while gender is more of a social construct.

I'm sure this is a simplification but it's confusing.

I've seen it said that even if a person with gender dysphoria were to have been born and raised by AI alone on an island with no society around - that they would still feel that something is not right. But that's untestable.

But if gender is a social construct then how could that be?

What even is gender? Is it a way to describe an aspect of your personality? I don't think so.... Maybe?

If a biological female identifies with things that are seen as more masculine then does this mean their gender is masculine? But what would be the difference, then, between someone who identifies as a masculine girl and some biological girl who identifies as a boy and transitions?

It being a social construct seems like an incomplete idea. Why not just reject societal norms (the false dichotomy of being either masculine or feminine) instead of going through the effort of changing your body to fit what society says you are if you exhibit certain characteristics?

What does it mean to *feel* masculine or to *feel* feminine if society has arbitrarily defined what is masculine and what is feminine and conditioned us from birth to see things in such a way? If one rejects the idea of gender completely and no longer sees the poles ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" (and the gradient in between) then would gender dysphoria still exist in said person? 

Unless gender does have a biological basis.... Not necessarily based in genitalia, though.

I had always thought it went something like this: ""I have a penis but feel more connection, resonance, and relation with parts of my personality that has been defined as 'feminine.' When I hear people use words and phrases like ""that is so girly"" it becomes clear to me that ""girliness"" exists apart from having a vagina. That the concept of ""girl"" brings with it a load of traits that may not even belong to someone with a vagina and may even be more appropriate being used to describe someone with a penis. This ""girl"" image in our culture is more appropriately used in describing a behavior instead of only describing one's genitalia and reproductiive organs. And here is where gender as a social construct is differentiated from sex as a biological function. Seeing how I identify with traits that are said to be ""girly"" it makes more sense that I am a girl with the genitalia of a biological man since my behavior reflects feminine qualities.""

But maybe my interpretation is a bit naive. It would just make more sense to say ""this gender thing is stupid. I identify as me and feel no need to divide the traits within myself between the two arbitrary categories of masculine and feminine and pick the one that I most identify with""

We’re each other’s first serious partner so obviously we don’t have much experience with sex. I’m eager to try new things, and she’s not. Plus we both live with our parents and she’s only comfortable doing things at my place. Let’s just say I am not vanilla at all, so this is a problem.

I’m scared I will never get to experience sex with anybody else, obviously, if we stay together. And being with only one person in your entire life is so scary to me. But I love her so much. I even broke up with her and then took it back an hour later because things wouldn’t be the same without being romantic with her. I know I’m a monogamist, so it’s like, fuck. 

It literally makes me cry (I mean, I feel like anyone would). I feel like I’m stuck to ignore my feelings and silently hope something goes wrong even though I know I’m still in love with her.

This happened a while ago, back in september 2020. One day, I decided to watch an anime movie called Fate/stay night: Heaven's Feel II. I've watched several animes from the Fate franchise, most of them in the living room's TV, it didn't contain things like nudity, just a bit of violence. So it was gonna be alright this time too, right?

Right?

I donwloaded the movie and started watching it on the TV. My parents were working from home, but I didn't think it was that big of deal. Thirty minutes into the anime, things started getting a little...weird. I started questioning if this was a good ideia. Then, one of the characters start undressing. And after this, there is the sex scene.

And of course my mom would appear in that exact moment. Not in any of the amazing fight scenes, nooooo. It had to be in the god damn sex scene.

So my mom almost didn't let me watch anime anymore, if it wasn't for my dad, he didn't make a big deal out of it. But yeah, my mom still gives me that disgusted look when I'm watching anything.

I didn't really fuck up things that bad, just wanted to share this story with you. Besides this little incident, it's a great movie, can't wait for the sequel!

My parents weren’t very supportive of this idea at first, but when it was clear that I was doing it no matter what, they eventually settled down. However, I received several texts a day asking how I was doing, what I was up to, and (if I wasn’t responding) if I was mad at them. This made my Ex upset, she said they were controlling and that it was frustrating that they wouldn’t leave me, and by association her, alone. 

     Problems started in my Ex’s and I’s relationship that caused her to break up with me in early October, which caused (and is still causing me) great distress. My family only makes this worse though. They say they’re “trying to help” but them helping is talking bad about my Ex behind my back and trying to get me to move on and forget about her, which I can’t do.

     At the beginning of the break-up, my Ex cited my problems as being why she was leaving me, and I accepted full responsibility for them. However, she is now saying that my family is the reason we aren’t together. I’m not going to lie we had some arguments about my family in the past, so it was no secret that she wasn’t fond of them. 

     There was one instance where I wasn’t responding to my family for a while, and I wasn’t at the apartment either. I told my Ex not to tell my parents where I was. My parents started calling my Ex and getting really mad when she wouldn’t tell them where I was, so my siblings then called my friends that they knew and asked. My mom then called my Ex’s mom, yelling about how my Ex had ruined my life and a whole bunch of other insults. She apologized to my Ex’s mom later, but never to my Ex. My whole family is convinced she is the devil and is using/manipulating me.

Me and my boyfriend have been together for a year now and we love each other, but recently there has been a lot of tension and we have started to fight a lot. It all started when we had a fight about me texting one of my exes (who is one of my good friends that he knows about) happy birthday. He kept saying that I shouldn't be in contact with any of my exes and that he felt betrayed. This was very weird because he knew about my ex and knew that we were still pretty close. During that time there was a lot of tension but he ended up just hate fucking me and forgetting about it. We also had a fight about me going to a work event and talking to other guys, even though they were my co workers and it was a work conference. He claimed that I was being flirty and trying to fuck other guys. This was completely untrue and I have done nothing to lead him to think that I would ever do something like that. We talked and he said that he was overreacting, which I agreed with. 

After that the tension still wasn't resolved and we had many other fights. We both noticed that and took some time to talk with each other, and are relationship and sex life improved greatly. We also opened up about our fantasies and he said he wanted to have a threesome. At first I was hesitant, but later agreed to it. We found this guy who was 6'4, muscular, and just overall very handsome. The original plan was to have a threesome with him but then my boyfriend said that he wanted us to mess around first so we could get to know each other. We both discussed some rules and then he let me go with the other guy. The other guy was so much different than my boyfriend. He was dominant and put me in my place (I liked this a lot). Me and the other guy had so much fun, and we tried lots of different stuff (Like bondage, punishments, anal, etc.). We also talked about a lot of deep stuff and I started to fall for this guy. I told my boyfriend about the feelings I had for the other guy and that we probably shouldn't have a threesome, I also told him we should probably cut all times with him. He said that it was fine and that it would be hotter because of the taboo aspect, and that it would be like unrequited love. I told him this was a bad idea, but he still wanted me to do it. 

So we get to the day of the threesome and my boyfriend cums fast, but still lets me and the other guy finish. You could tell when me and the other guy fucked there was a lot more passion. Later that night my boyfriend liked that another guy could have me and fuck all my holes. But, he said the threesome arrangement wasn't going to work, and he would much rather have an open relationship where both of us would get to fuck other people by ourselves. He would go with multiple people, but I only wanted the threesome guy. This arrangement worked for a couple months, but now my boyfriend says he wants me to cut all ties with the other guy because he feels that he can""t compare to him and that it will affect our sex life. I told him that it wasn't true and that i'm perfectly happy with our sex life, but he doesn't believe me.  He said we could fuck one more time but thats it. So the other guy came to my house and we started fooling around, but during it my boyfriend walked in and saw us. He was livid and said that we should be more careful and what we were doing was disgusting and we should be ashamed. He also was smashing and throwing things. We got into a big fight and he called me a ""worth nothing dirty whore who will take anyones dick"" this hurt a lot because of a past relationship that was verbally abusive. It also reminded me of when we used to fight a lot. When things cooled down he said I was going to have to choose between him and the other guy.

**Avoid excessive communication**

Don’t be too clingy and possessive. There is no need to communicate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to keep the relationship in check. Some think speaking is the way to make up the distance, but not because it can only make the situation worse. Soon you would be tired of loving.

**To make rules**

 Manage your expectations by setting ground rules. Be clear about what to expect. Don’t do things that surprise the person.

I had been hooking up with a friend who lives 30 minutes away and I decided that I would lose it to him since we had been having other types of sex for a while and since we were exclusive. 

He came last night around 2 am and I snuck out of my house. When I got to his car he started complaining about gas money and how he had to drive 30 minutes to get here. I was a little taken aback and then he asked me to pay him. I said I only had 50s in my wallet and he took my wallet off the front seat and took a 50 without even asking. I decided I'd confront him about it later because I didn't want to kill the mood. 

Anyway there was some foreplay and then as he was going in, he went completely soft. It was a little confusing and I could tell he was really embarrassed. He flipped back over and made me give him head. I assumed this was to get him hard enough to have sex again but instead he just came and started putting his clothes back on. 

He was very rude and basically kicked me out of the car without even saying bye or let me finish putting my jacket back on. In the middle of all of it, I forgot about the 50 dollars he took and went home. The next morning, I texted him to make sure he was okay and tried to be really nice because I could tell he was embarrassed, but he didn't respond. I then remembered the money and asked for it back, to which he finally responded ""no"" and hasn't contacted me since then. It's been 4 days. 

What should I do? Should I just ghost him back? 50 dollars may not be a big deal to most but it is for me. I'm also not completely sure why he went soft and if I could have done anything.

So I've been seeing this guy on and off for about 5 months now and I recently went to his place for the first time after I hadn't seen him in a while. I had told him I didn't want to have condomless sex multiple times but he continuously kept coercing me until I broke and decided to. I just feel like he doesn't give two shits about me and my sexual health and I feel ashamed about getting coerced into doing it after so much pressure and now I'm worried sick about STDs.

One of his reasons after he pressured me a few times was that his penis was chaffing with condoms and so I started feeling kinda guilty which also contributed to me having condomless sex. But why didn't care about the fact that he could easily spread STD's to me as he had slept with another girl prior to me that was not even in a real relationship, but a FWB (so could have been sleeping with many other people)? He also said that if I do get an STD, that I could just ""get antibiotics quickly and have it cleared up"". 

Idk I just feel really hurt and kind of traumatized every time I think of it now and I also had a nightmare where I was trying to tell him my needs and he just didn't care.

Well, I guess the decision to get rid of Max wasn't universal and the entire friend group split in half, those of us who immediately dropped Max and those who did not. People accused us of engaging in ""cancel culture"", going on a ""witch hunt"". Tensions were high, there was lots of glaring in the hallways, but high school didn't last forever.

Fast forward to recently. The people who gravitated to Max's side all began posting the same thing: ""If you won't be friends with Max, but will be friends with Oliver, you're a hypocrite"" Oliver was another close friend of mine. Hearing about Max being a predator wasn't very surprising to me, but this was a shocker. Oliver was always on the anti-Max side of the whole deal and condemned those who defended him. He's my best guy friend, super supportive and always been much more progressive than Max.

I asked around if anyone was willing to share information. From what I gathered, it was more of a stalking situation, and there was no unwanted contact. The victim was a girl I knew, Dana, who dated Oliver for a couple weeks in high school and then they broke up. Later on she sided with Max so they completely fell out. 

I talked to Oliver about everything. I told him that he's one of my best friends, and that I didn't have a bad gut feeling about him like I did with Max, but my principle is to believe survivors and I can't just immediately take his side. He seemed sad to hear this, but he ultimately told me that he thinks it's an honorable principle to have and that he understands if I cut him out. Then he told me his story. He said he never stalked anyone, but Halloween night in Junior year, he thought it would be funny to dingdong ditch Dana because it was shortly after they broke up. He had been to her house before. He admitted it was stupid and that he shouldn't have done it.

Upon hearing this, and knowing that this woman is a part of Max's posse, I am wondering if this is something that was blown way out of proportion or not. I truly don't believe Oliver is a bad guy, but then again I have no idea who is telling the truth, so what if there was more to it? I haven't made a decision yet on whether to drop him, but I really don’t want to. Does that make me a hypocrite? Should I drop him?

All was good, got my room renovated, nothing could go wrong for 2021 right?

Anyway it was already 2 am and everyones already sleeping while i am alone in my room, it wouldnt hurt to beat my dick off to some really good hentai that i was specifically saving for this very event but unfortunately, there was no internet. Luckily i had this app with videos and files i downloaded from the internet so surely there must be some leftover porn in it. I found this one video of a woman just showing her ass and teasing the viewers (if thats the term for it). I completely forgot about that video before so it felt like seeing it like its my first time. Holy shit it was really fucking hot dude like there was no music so you can hear her moaning, breathing n shi, it felt like she was close to me (god im lonely). Suddenly there was this part where she slaps her ass, i suddenly got a really weird feeling and got really fucking horny but i wanna make it hotter because its new year so it needs to be special. I went to this video editing app, literally edited parts of the video to be louder, repeated, zoomed in, all that shit because i was literally that horny and desperate. Theres a problem tho, i cant go out or they might find out, the only lube is the backup menthol shampoo in my cabinet, it will give a spicy sensation but i had to risk it.

Yeah that wasnt a good idea, i watched like the entire video while doing a literally doing a bop-it combo attack on my dick, it felt refreshing during the moment until i fucking came dude. Legit it felt like fire needle porcupines are going in and out of my dick at the same time and leaving splinters afterwards. I had menthol shampoo as lube a few times before, i could handle it but the problem is that it was a special day. I was doing it for like a long time nonstop with combos and i was watching a really cute video made hotter with my editing which means it was extra painful and i fucking came for around 10 seconds. IT WAS LIKE 10 SECONDS OF GIVING BIRTH THROUGH MY DICK!!1! anyways i drank alot of water for refreshment but i was stupid, i had to pee which means i gotta go through that pain again. That went on for like 3 hours but it was slowly fading.

So I am a straight male, who has read enough about the male g-spot resulting in me experimenting a few times “back there” with toys and fingers and I have some questions.

1.	What should the sensation feel like? Like the actual penetration is an interesting sensation, and I believe it does feel good, but nothing that I would equate to orgasmic
2.	After reading online I believe that I found my prostate when doing this, and spent time massaging it and while I do get semi erect and it feels okay, nothing that really would be similar to an orgasm or a release
3.	After like 10-15 minutes of stimulation again it feels okay, however I can’t help but feel like I am doing it wrong.
4.	Is there such a thing as a g-spot orgasm, and without it being a weird question...what was it like, was it clear that was what was happening?

I am really just trying figure out if I am doing it wrong, or if like, I am doing it right, and it might not be for me.

Anyway a few years ago the same thing was happening and I was trying to get out of the house. At the time I was 12. On day my neighbor let me in his house so we could play video games. For context he was a 20 year old at the time living with his grandma. (she is a very sweet German lady.) 
Throughout the next few days he slowly told me I was cute. I didn’t think much of it. Until one day he showed me porn and kept commenting about my boner. 
The next day when he invited me in he told me when he was 19 and had sex with a 14 year old girl. The dude told me she liked it and went into detail. He then asked me if he could see my thing because he “wanted to make it feel good.” I tried to say no but he pulled my pants down and jerked me off and then made me do the same to him.
Before he finally let me leave he told me to not tell my parents because they would disown me. I never saw him again after that day.
What makes me feel guilty is that I never told anyone. That bitch made me feel insecure about my sexuality for years until I found out I was straight. But the worst thing is that if he did it two times without getting caught, I know he will do it again. I always go through the news to see if he has been arrested yet. But I haven’t found him.

If that’s not porn, what’s the line between being a person who post pictures and “porn star”? If I was a girl posting bikini pictures, is that porn? What if just posted bra pictures? What if bikini pictures but in suggestive poses? What if nudity but everything’s censored?

I didn't really think about sharing this one, but since I got a notification, that my throw away account has a cake day, I just couldn't miss the opportunity that I had so similar TIFU exactly a year ago!!

So during these COVID times, my friends and I just chat in the Discord pretty often. Yesterday was one of those days, and since I had just finished my first exam, it was time to celebrate. That meant that I brought my Vodka from the freezer and we started doing proper shots. Now, whenever I drink during discord calls, I get really loud. Not really sure why, but it just makes the call 10 times better if I can laugh with my full voice. My wife on the other hand is the best wife a man can ever have! When ever we have that kind of night with my friends, she's okay with falling asleep on the couch (since my pc is in the bedroom).

So there we are having our drinks and just chatting. I suddenly have a very good idea about turning our cameras on, since it would make drinking so much more fun! After a bit of time everybody agree and that's what we do. We had like 11 people in the call, with everybody's cameras on! It was so fun! After a while at one moment I took a toilet break, and then while sneaking through our living room, my wife suddenly said: ""No need to sneak, I'm not sleeping."" Its 4AM. She is really angry. I go right to her and start asking why she didn't tell me. Usually she falls asleep really quick, but this time it was much harder for her. She said that I was being too loud. I was very sorry and offered her that she can come to bed and I'll just call it a night with my friends. She said angrily, that she didn't care and that she will stay on the couch. Since my bladder was about to explode, I just ran to the toilet.

When I came back, I didn't see her on the couch anymore. She had gone to bed. I ran to our bedroom just to see that I had been disconnected from the Discord call. That meant that everybody saw her. I explained her the situation and called everybody back right away to ask how many of them had seen. The admin of our Discord server said that they reacted quickly and everybody didn't see. I disconnected and ran back to the bed to comfort my wife. But then she explained to me that it would've been one thing if she walked straight to the bed, but instead she walked right towards and then past the computer to turn off the light on my table. Everybody got an absolutely clear view. She didn't even think about that I have video on, since we do it so rarely with a webcam enabled.

So there I was... Crushed with shame and a proper hangover.
Today I took myself together and went back to their discord, they didn't mention the situation and everything seems to be going good. Its just the idea that ALL OF MY FRIENDS SAW MY WIFE NAKED, is what makes me feel soooo baaaaaad! So bad for my wife... She didn't even now...

And now the fact that it has exactly been a year from the last situation with Discord makes it even funnier. I hope you guys get a good laugh out of it.

I love them, everythings been pretty good, but I have a consistent issue with not bringing up things that upset me. Today I decided to finally express my feelings.

On my twitter, a tweet popped up on my timeline saying like “(boyfriends name) has liked this tweet!” the tweet in question was something along the lines of like “why havent u admitted u wanna make out w me so bad” or something along those lines. I was intrigued, and clicked on the account. I immediately realized it was a NSFW acc, that mostly posted their own NSFW pics or retweeted other peoples. I also saw that my boyfriend was following this account. I was extremely upset and uncomfortable; I’m perfectly fine with my boyfriend watching porn, and I’d even be okay with knowing that they liked to scroll through this account sometimes , but the fact that they chose to follow it and like some tweets talking about making out with the owner (I know thats a bit of a stretch, but they were weird tweets to like) made me extremely upset. 

So I brought it up with them. Immediately their response was “I’m sorry but I can follow whoever I want.” I told them that I understood that, but that it made me extremely uncomfortable, embarrassed and insecure. They told me that them following that account doesn’t mean that they want to be with me any less or that they find me any less attractive, and that I was projecting my own insecurities onto them by getting upset about this. Again, I understand this, but at the end of the day the account made me extremely uncomfortable. Point-blank. In my opinion, it could’ve all been solved if my boyfriend just replied by saying something like “oh I’m sorry, I didn’t know it’d make you upset, I’ll unfollow” but they seemed very defensive and kept arguing that they could follow whoever they wanted. I told them that of course they can, but out of respect for me and my feelings it would make me feel better if they didn’t.

After arguing for like an hour, they told me that they would unfollow. I thought that was it, but then they said “I don’t know why I have to, but I will.” I told them that I had just spent the last hour telling them why I would like them to unfollow. Yes, its their account, and yes, they can follow whoever they want; but out of respect for ME and my feelings I was asking that they unfollow. I don’t go checking who they follow, this was just something I stumbled across and I really wish that I hadn’t. They’ve since unfollowed, but I really dislike how defensive they were and how adamant they seemed on remaining following her. They did seem sorry and upset, and they kept telling me that they loved me and that them following that account was in no way anything towards me, but it didn’t change how I felt.

Pretty much title, but a little more background:

My girlfriend and I have been dating for over 4 months now, and we try to be as communicative as possible in our relationship. 

In the bedroom, I always ask for her permission before doing anything we haven’t done before, and if she ever says no, I make sure to be very understanding, as the last thing I want is for her to not feel comfortable with me. And really, I could care less about how long we wait to have sex because sex is more of the cherry on top of the dating her sundae for me. 

Sometimes I do feel like a prick for asking her about what she wants to do, but she’s explained to me that she’s a bit shy about moving things along by herself, so I see me asking more as just checking in on what she’s comfortable with, not like i’m constantly asking her to perform sexual favors. 

I asked her the other night if she was feeling ready for sex. She said she was, but that she had recently started a new birth control, and that we should wait a week or two to be safe. 

I told her that’s totally fine, no rush as usual, and that it’s still totally on her timeline. A yes today doesn’t mean a yes in two weeks sort of thing. 

She’s expressed concern in past conversations about “not being good at it” and being awkward, to which I’ve tried to tell her that I couldn’t really care less if she’s good at it or not, I’m with her because I love her not because I’m expecting her to be some sex goddess. 

I remember my first time being a bit of a shit show, and I was embarrassed the entire time with thoughts of inadequacy. 

My question is, when the time comes, how do I make it as enjoyable and comfortable for her? I want it to be as natural and romantic as possible, but I’m really not sure how. All of my past experiences have been hookups, so this is uncharted territory. 

tl;dr: my girlfriend has expressed desire to lose her vcard with me, but when i lost mine it was awkward and unpleasant. how do I make her first time the opposite of mine?

Before asking questions, I'm an 15 year old guy and have no problems not masturbating if I don't want to.

1. Sometimes when I ejaculate my eyes get a bit wet. Is it something I should be worrying about?
2. I masturbate once every day, is it too much?
3. I usually put my load in tissues, flush them and wash my hands (and my specific organ). Am I doing something wrong?

It's the end of the day, and my fellow band students and I are rushing to the storage area to grab our musical instruments and hop on the bus. Secretly, I'm hoping to run into E, another tenor saxophonist in my grade, as I have a *massive* crush on him. That fleeting moment where we grab our saxophones and bid each other farewell is easily one of the highlights of my day. 

I race into the band storage room, and deflate a bit when I realize that there's only one sax in the cabinet - my cherished E has already come and gone! I grab my sax and then realize, with a twang of horror, that this is actually E's sax, and that he's accidentally taken mine. 

I'm awash with panic - for some reason, this is ""like, a really big deal!"". I rush out into the main band room, where my band teacher and the chorus teacher are chatting and getting ready to lock-up. I run over, and quickly explain the situation, and they ask me which number bus E usually rides. 

Now - I was always a bus rider - E, however, was not. His mother picked him up from school most days, and I had a habit of secretly watching him get into her car and drive off (Creepy much? I digress, middle school crushes are weird.). Anyway, I thought I had the info needed to sort the situation out, and in my panic, I made (what I later understood to be) one of the most embarrassing mistakes of my life. So... back to the story...

""What bus does E take?""

""E doesn't take the bus, his mom picks him up!""

""Oh, well... do you know what his mom's car looks like?""

""It's a white vulva!""

... 

At the time, I had no idea that ""Volvo"" was not the same word as ""vulva"". 

I must have said it 6 or 7 times over the course of my attempt to get this situation sorted out. How the teachers ever kept from bursting out laughing is beyond me - but I was painfully aware that there was an unusual lack of eye-contact throughout this entire exchange. I can't imagine how awkward it was from their perspective.

Anyway, E's mother had already driven off by the time we checked the parking lot. The kicker? I realize now, in hindsight, she actually drove a VW Jetta.

i'm 18(ftm) and my boyfriend is 24(m), but that's not what this is about.
me and my boyfriend have been online dating for almost a year now, and i'm facing an issue. so last month, without getting in to details, i found a twitter that he had and blocked me from on 2 of my accounts, so i went on a gaming account that he didn't know about. i looked through the account, it was solely to talk to sex workers, get pics, and all that jazz. and man. that shit fucking HURT. 
i wasn't completely bothered until i saw a tweet that he replied to that said ""i only have 1 friend, someone PLEASE fall in love with me i'm begging you,,,,"" and he replied with ""🙋🏻‍♂️"". and understandably, i broke down and fucking sobbed. from my POV, there's no way that didn't look like cheating. i talked to him about it, we sorted things out, i asked my questions, i got my answers, and he wasn't cheating. he told me he thought that he would break up with me if i found the account.
so my question is, if he thought i'd break up with him over it, why did he do it ??? i don't even know how long this account was up. he admitted what he did was wrong, and was sorry, but i can't get that thought out of my head. he said he was addicted to the thrill of people responding and getting pictures, but it still hurts me. i've tried to move passed it, i have. but i still have this huge cloud of paranoia over me. i've been checking his online status on EVERYTHING like crazy, i'm scared when he doesn't respond when he's online, and i don't know what the fuck to do.
i trust him. i do. but after he deactivated the twitter he told me he looks at models in order to not go back on twitter. 
i confronted him last night about a porn addiction, but somehow it derailed and ended up becoming me realizing that *I* have issues. i don't know what to do.
i love him so god damn much and i don't want to end our relationship over something this stupid. 
how do i convince myself that he's not looking at things behind my back? how to i assure myself that i can put my full trust on him? we literally made written boundaries lists, and i just still feel so scared.
i've gotten rid of the feature on my apps that show me if people are online, and i told him, but it's making me more anxious. 
he realizes what he did was wrong, but it's so hard for me to trust that he's staying off of twitter and interacting with sex workers. i know he only did it because he was horny, but i keep thinking to myself, why didn't he just come to me ?? why did he feel like he had to talk to strangers online ?? why did he reply to that tweet the way he did ??
he can clearly tell i'm having a trust problem, and i just want to fix it. what do i do? how do i get better? i don't want to lose him:(

Me (20NB, born F) and my girlfriend (20F) have been in a relationship for a bit longer than a year at this point, weve known eachother for years prior.

Weve both been openly bisexual with eachother for a few years and it wasn't until i got out of my abusive household and started focusing on myself and relationships more that i realised i had feelings for her.

only issue is my gf doesnt like lesbian sex, she never has. sure we've used some toys but nothing drastic and she's not really a fan. we give eachother room and time to please ourselves on our own any time we need.

my girlfriend came to me the other day and asked for an open relationship.  she wasn't  getting sexual pleasure from the relationship and offered the idea that we could both hook up with guys (or girls in my case) on the side, as long as we both know full details and when and where and don't catch feelings.

i told her its something i wanted to think over, I'm incredibly scared of abandonment and her leaving me for someone that could give her that sexual pleasure. i don't think it's the act of her having sex with other people, I'm just terrified of losing her.

i spoke with my friend about it who told me i should accept the open relationship because it was unfair for me to keep her stuck like this because of my own insecurities.

I preface this with the following: prior to my wife, I had only had sex with 1 other woman. So confidence has always been an issue. I'm a bigger guy and a bit introverted. To add to this, once my wife and I  got together, I knew that she was going to be every one-sided in the bedroom. She loved foreplay for herself but never really gave it. 

So for the first 5 years of our marriage everything was great? Typical routine: make out, I go down on her, then we have sex. I DONT LAST LONG. Maybe a a few minutes, longer if I had been drinking, so I always like to make sure she can get off by my hands or mouth because I feel it's right and I enjoy doing it. Nothing ever changed, same routine, same positions, never foreplay on my end. It just came to be that I needed to be hard off of making out with her. I never had that issue until after 1 girls trip weekend. 

She went away for a few days on a girl's trip and when she got home, I remember her first thing was to kiss me then she got down and started giving me head. Completely shocked me and was out of the ordinary, but I loved it! Now, I love my wife, but you can tell she hadn't done it often prior to me,  and if I ever did receive it,  it was stopped after about 2 mins.  Not complaining! But I can count on one hand how many times I've received a bj and/or hj to completion. Odd grips during a a hand job or no hand involvement during a blow job. Now if course, I would try my best to help her and tell her what I like so that she can enjoy it as much as I can. (That sounds bad but I know she gets satisfied mentally if I enjoy it)

SOOO, during this impromptu blowtorch, she's expecting me to cum and I don't.  Idk why I just didn't. I hadn't jacked off that day and I feel like it was me being caught off guard that didn't help either. She got very disappointed and it got inside my head. That same night, I was in my head, because I wanted to perform for her, and I couldn't get hard. That just doubled down on her confidence as well as mine. It's been up and down the past 2 years with it happening on and off and it all came to a head 2 nights ago. 

We recently had a baby and haven't had sex yet but we have done other things to both enjoy ourselves. She will jerk me off and then she will ride my leg while I play with her body. It's new, it's exciting, it's different and I've loved it. Haven't had go worry about performing sex and getting hard.

 We did our normal grocery run and she told me to get some condoms. (I'm not here to debate condoms, no condoms, birth control. We like condoms for it so that's our choice. Stick to the topic). From then on out, I was in my head. *alright anon, time to get her goin, she expects it* so on and so forth. Needless to say, I couldn't. Normally I would just keep this to me after apologizing but I felt like I needed her in this moment. I told her how I'm in my head about being nervous, and anxious about performing. I brought up that I enjoy being touched, played with and would like more foreplay. That being expected to get hard after just kissing isn't realistic for me. She came back with the following: *""Well I'm don't know what to do for you anymore. I just don't understand and it's clearly me""*

I tried my best to make her understand that it's about me being nervous and excited and anxious but that she needs to help me and she wasn't having that. So I come to yall for advice: How do I move forward and talking to her about it? Therapist? Sex Therapist? I love my wife dearly and yes I obviously find her attractive. Please help!

TLDR: Wife gave unexpected blowjob, I didn't come. Over 2 years it has fostered in my head. Expectations of me being hard after only making out make me nervous and I constantly think about it while we are trying to get hot and heavy. I failed to get hard 2 nights ago, attempted to explain I'm inside my head due to expectations and lack of foreplay. What do I do? How do I talk to her?

Telling someone they aren't serious enough or aren't holding narccistic, egoistic people accountable is victim blaming. I can't change anyone in life besides me. 

If a person is an asshole and really mean by nature or for some reason doesn't like me and our personalities clash, no matter how nice I am to him, he will still be a jerk to me. What baffles me is that certain people have acted better to the local dogs rather their own classmate which really hurt me while some had no problems with me and were really kind. What also bothers me is that certain people have villified me, so I have bad social life and don't go out much and people who have fucked me up in high school had the nerve to bad mouth me to their friends and now many people I don't even know think I am bitchy, mean, evil person. When I was in 11th grade I was really scared to leave my home and buy my self food since I have met people who bad mouthed me or mocked me while I was buying food which made me not leave for weeks, and don't get me started on the street harassment I endured.

I am trying to understand social skills because I know my brain is programmed differently but I am surely not stupid. Maybe a tiny bit codependent due to childhood trauma abuse but not stupid. There were moments in my life where it was physically impossible to say no to some people. I am not proud of saying yes. I am ashamed of my self and I feel like I constantly mess up my relationships due to my anxiety from abuse but I can't be comfortable with people. I can't be comfortable in my own skin if I feel like everyone in the whole city hates me(They don't, but the random street harassment I endured by both children and random old men kind of made me believe that mixed with seeing certain people who bullied me to the point of S in school. I know they will not chase me forever but I am afraid of showing my face sometimes. It feels like I am cursed sometimes and only bad things happen to me)

I am reading self help books on emotional intelligence and try to understand how to have normal conversation with people and keep it going since small talk has always been hard for me. I can say that certain things are easier to learn than others as in I have improvement in some areas but feel stuck in others if that makes sense.  I can't get a psychologist at the moment and the only one I had was the high school one, somewhat, and the I went to another for a very short period. I have tried 7 cups once or twice but for some reason I am ...blocked????? I guess I will have to use another mail. I can proudly say that 7cups is not good for psycholgical help and it is filled with trolls and people who don't know anything about psychology and have bad english which can be triggering if you have a bad panic attack.

I honestly hope that with this Covid I can get a job during the summer so I wouldn't have to be on my laptop all day, do nothing, feel bad over the fact that I have no one to hang out with or anything to fill my time with. I have tried learning a language but failed on all of my tests and I didn't have enough money for martial arts and only tried them for few months.

i see these constant quotes over all kinds of social media, that you are ''wise'' and ''mature'' if you let go and forgive the other person. I don't feel any more hate if I do not forgive them. I find it hard to forgive people who give me ptsd flashbacks, made me bitter, made me afraid to leave my own home, made me hate my own body and cut it, made me starve even though i was already thin, made me feel inadequate, weird, less than for not having friends and hanging out, made me feel weak for not being able to insult others like a normal human. Maybe I happen to see insults as childish and shallow,eh?

I no longer deal with most of them but these personality types haunt me. I know most people call this bullshit but I am very empathetic and certain personality types just don't like that. I do get along with many people and with those who I don't we just don't talk to each other. But certain people in my life don't get that and they had to go out of their way to show me that they don't like me through severe bullying? I guess ignoring and not talking to whom you don't like is too mature for their brain so the only ''option'' they had was to attack what they don't like or understand. I don't understand them too but I don't go to insult everyone I know. The problem is that I get them but they don't get me. And those who do get me, kinda make me feel worse. Which is why I avoided both good and bad people.

So apperently I should hold people ''accountable'' for crossing my boundaries which is true, but like if you assert them a few times and some people just don't care and attack you cause they can, how are you supposed to deal with them if they are more than you and stronger than you? Or just happen to be older? I want people to respect my boundaries and don't cross them and respect me as a person. They don't have to like me. A lot of people already in my life dislike me, and I feel the same way about some of them too, but I respect them and don't pressure them to do certain stuff like some people do to me. I thought saying no a few times would give the hint but that only makes them pressure me more. Is there a way to deal with narccistic type of people who cross your boundaries and don't care about that but only if you overreact/make a show/try to not cause a scene by crying and falling on your knees? For me involving a 3rd party helps but it is hard to ask one for help since they are not really objective and find it hard to take my side when many people have a problem against me when in reality only few do but they have spread so many rumours nad lies that many just happen to believe them and if ''ONLY I HAVE A PROBLEM'' with them I must surely be in the wrong.

i no longer want to see my self as a victim but want to seem empowered. I want to grow behind the experience and not let it mould me into a more hateful and bitter person but I find it hard to trust people(especially those from the male gender) after everything that has happened to me I feel huge betrayl and find it hard to imagine someone actually loving me or marrying me-the thought of it scares me just as much as ending up all alone-due to society pressure and those being alone being concidered losers,low class,low social status and left for dead where I live, usually pitied. I do not want to be pitied but be a role model. Maybe I will never be a leader like I wanted to, but I do not want to be a follower. Going with the flow and to be like the sheep was never me, not being a leader or a follower is one of the reasons why I was hated, or Idk, those who bullied me and hurt me physically or emotionally or messed with my head never explained why they did it but I refuse to forgive them.

I 48M) live with my wife (45F), daughter (16F) and my stepson (18M). My stepson lives with me one week and his father and stepmother the other (my daughter lives with me all the time because her mother moved to Britain with another man). We all live in Florida (I don’t feel comfortable disclosing any more information than that).

Up until about a year ago he was in a relationship with a girl a few months younger than he was. They seemed to get along really well and I thought they loved each other but they got distant and he started to rant about her and things she did constantly. Obviously I sided with him, she seemed to be acting immature and didn’t like how he coped with his mental health. She claimed he was gaslighting her and said his actions were damaging to her mental health.

They broke up and it seemed ok until she clearly started to reflect on the relationship and started to dislike my stepson. Then she did something unbelievable. She claimed he had sexually assaulted her 5 times when he stayed over at her house but had told her she was “making it up”. She had been building up anger against him and had removed herself from contact of all his friends and family (unfollowed on social media etc) but it got out that she was publicly talking about what her ex did to her.

 I was FURIOUS and I stormed to where she lived and BLASTED her. Her parents were worried and she hadn’t told them. She came outside and told me what had happened, she was distraught, shaking, crying, she looked like she was going to throw up or pass out. I told her she was lying, she swore on her life she wasn’t. She apologised for what she did (spreading that he assaulted her) but was indignant that she was telling the truth. her mom came outside and I shortly left- still enraged and as I walked to my car I heard shouting from the house. I drove back to apartment- angry that she would lie about him out of spite. The whole drive I was FURIOUS.

When I got back I asked him if it was true and he stood there, pale faced. I asked again and he just shook his head feebly and ran away. Now I’m wondering if she was telling the truth. I went to go to speak to him- man to man to get the truth out so we could do something about her lies and he just said “go away, I’m sorry”. I don’t know what to do, I don’t think she was lying now and I can’t go back to fix it because I yelled at her so much. 

What should I do after I blasted her and now I don’t think she was lying?

edit: I am going to delete this post in a few hours and will consult with a couple of friends of mine who are lawyers about what to do. I have just texted my stepson to tell him that he isn’t welcome in my house anymore and that his stuff will need to be collected from my house by next Tuesday or it will be donated or sold.

No matter what I do or say, he insists that I am disgusted by his dick. I am starting to wonder if he's trying to sabotage the relationship on purpose. 

My bf (30) and I never had issues in the bedroom and I thought this aspect of our relationship was pretty solid, even though the relationship in general has been rocky because he has abandonment issues. 

About a week ago he had an orgasm before I did, which rarely happens, and then just stopped and said he was going to nap. I was surprised because normally he isn't selfish in bed. I asked him to go down on me which he did but he was very obviously reluctant. I then asked if something was wrong since he didn't seem into it at all. He shrugged and said that he already came so he felt zero arousal and didn't feel like doing it. 

I initiated a conversation because this is unlike him and it seemed selfish. Well, that quickly spiraled into him saying he can't please me anyway (he can and normally always does) and that his dick is too small (it's not) and there are other guys out there who can please me better (I've never expressed interest in other guys while together and since I am demisexual I don't even feel attraction towards anyone else). He said he understood why I was disgusted by him and that he doesn't deserve my body anyway, so from now on he'll just never orgasm during sex again. 

I have no idea where this came from because I am very vocal about loving him, his body and having sex with him, and we both initiate often. 

I've tried everything: telling him what I loved about him, that I always love sex with him, pointing out statistics that prove that his dick isn't small, pointing out that he makes me come &gt;99% of the time which is pretty impressive in itself, explaining that I'm not so big down there myself and I don't want a bigger dick because it would hurt, that the whole big dick thing is mostly a porn thing anyway. I have asked him what was going on in his mind, what made him feel like he wasn't good enough, that I don't judge him in any way but I just want us to understand each other better... Everything. But I was just met with responses like ""you don't have to console me like I'm a little bitch"", ""if you are so attracted to me then you would fuck me right now"" and ""I'm not insecure, I'm just a little bitch who can't please you and that's a fact"". Apparently he is always stressed during sex because he is afraid I won't have an orgasm. He never mentioned this before in the year we've been together and since I basically always come I don't understand why he's so worried. 

It took him 2 days to kind of relax and respond to me showing him affection. I hoped that this was the end of it. 

But nope, last night it happened again. Just the same shit all over again: can't blame me for being disgusted, gets that I would rather fuck other guys, from now on we shouldn't have sex anymore because he doesn't deserve it. I also found out that he was apparently faking an orgasm the first time we had sex after that first conversation. He said that he didn't fake anything but just didn't come, but I definitely remember him changing the rhythm and making ""the noise"". I remember asking him afterwards if he came too (it seemed different than normal) and he said yes. When I brought this up he just said ""I don't think I faked it, but if you think I did and then lied about it then that proves that I'm a piece of shit"". At some point during the conversation he tried to go down on me out of the blue. Because the timing was so weird and the vibe wasn't sexy at all I asked him to stop, and he saw that as a sign that I must indeed be disgusted by him. 

Eventually he said he was tired and we decided to talk about it later. I tried to sleep but he just sat on the edge of the bed for a while, then left to play video games all night. He came to bed in the morning and when he noticed he accidentally woke me up, he got awkward again, almost left the bedroom and only came back when I asked him why, then just sat on the edge of the bed again.  

I have no idea how to handle this. I feel like I've tried everything. Sometimes I feel like he needs the drama. Maybe his fear of abandonment leads to ""testing me"" and asking for more validation. But then when I give him that he fights it. I don't get it at all. 

I told him we would talk about it later, but what should I say? Should I just say what I've said before and basically just try to make him feel wanted? Or does this all sound like he's self-sabotaging and would this be enabling him? Does anyone have any insights about what the fuck is going on? It's a sensitive topic so I don't want to accidentally make it worse.

Until about Christmas, I've been content with my day to day routine of waking up, going to work, going home, and going to bed. Now, I crave something outside of reading, online dates, video games, and cooking in my free time. 
With my friends and family scattered around the nation, I have little interaction with people in my day to day life, and while a prostitute may not fill the void of being alone, it's certainly going to be an exciting adventure for me. Granted, this isn't my first rodeo finding someone advertising that they do body rubs. My first experience, where I lost my virginity during a ""body rub"", was rather disappointing; but now I at least know what to expect: a meeting at a nice hotel, brief introductions, suddenly lose hundreds of dollars, and let the foreplay begin. From there, it's anyone's guess.
However, I do have the sinking feeling that either she posted that ad more out of desperation. It's normally a red flag for me when I see someone trying to bargain for some money up front (like most scammers do via PayPal or something), but when I assured her I'd pay in full when I'd arrive at our scheduled appointment, she didn't argue and gave me the address to the hotel. At least that tells me her client base isn't very big, and she'd rather trust that I would come rather than turn me away because she insists I pay something up front. Either way, out of willingness or desperation, I'll follow her lead. After all, it's the least I can do.
I can't help but feel just a little bit sorry for her, and hopefully, this experience will help us both out in a way. Who knows, maybe we'll be seeing more of each other down the road too.

Those arguing that women can't be bad at sex were basically saying that a woman has a ""natural intuition"" on how to please a man and that the man always has an orgasm whereas a woman does not.  One of the women made a really interesting argument that said women are genetically programed with being able to please a man as his being able to orgasm is needed to further the species.

The people arguing that women can be bad at sex said that it is the very idea that women think they can't be bad at sex can lead to low or not effort which of course leads to bad sex.  The woman who said that it is possible for women to be bad at sex happened to be bi sexual so nobody is questioning her opinion.

My boyfriend dresses up nicely for work and when he gets off he will call me so I can watch him change This is relevant later. We're in a long distance relationship btw. This day was no different, I was hanging out on discord with some online friends and when he called I just took off my headphones so I could hear what he said, not paying attention to the fact there might be some NSFW words to soon be said.

I didn't realize the severity of the situation until a bit later. I thought initially they would just be hearing some stuff I said to him as he was changing. I like the way he looks and all that. After the initial embarrassment I was able to calm down a little, but then I realized they possibly heard the part about the rule and such and my shame and embarrassment increased tenfold and now I want to yeet myself off a cliff and never use discord again.

I called him my boyfriend for lack of a better word, but honestly we're sort of on a break at the moment. A bit of background, we've been together for two years and up until recently, I thought everything was going great. We were planning a future together and I even thought we were going to get engaged fairly soon. But, a month ago he told me he has ""sexual urges"" and more or less wants to have a hoe phase (and he has since started it once I told him we could take a break for him to sort it out). At first I thought it was because I wasn't satisfactory in the bedroom/he wanted me to top more, so I said I could do that and he said it ""changes things"" but he still wants to have this hoe phase. He said it doesn't really have much to do with me personally and rather that he ""misses that life"" as he used to sleep around a lot before we got together. In his words, he misses ""being a toy"" for other people. I've never been the type to want that kind of life so I suppose it's hard for me to understand.

On one hand, I kinda know why he feels this way. He often expressed that he doesn't feel he deserves me which may make him think I would be better off without him. I also think some childhood trauma has made him feel worthless (he has also suggested this might contribute to his desire) and like he doesn't deserve to be loved by anyone and all he's good for is sex. Obviously over the past two years I have tried working on this with him and I know I made him feel loved -- but I think he never felt like he actually deserved it.

On the other hand, I can't even begin to tell you how much this hurts. He hasn't been there for me or made me feel loved at in this past month because of all of this. Maybe I'm being unrealistic, but when you meet ""the one,"" aren't your eyes not supposed to stray? Or is he just being human? I fought and I fought for this relationship to work by changing myself, my attitude, and by being supportive, but he is having this phase regardless. He said he feels guilty -- immense guilt -- but clearly it wasn't enough to stop him either. It feels like his actions aren't lining up with his words. I feel that I have been incredibly supportive of him and still have been by giving him space to work on this, but how long should I wait? It feels like if I were truly the love of his life, he wouldn't need this, right? Or am I just being overly romantic? He hasn't been treating me like he used to either. He's been more harsh and short with me, but does say he loves me. Maybe he just doesn't love me that much, I don't know. I love him, but don't I deserve someone who won't do this to me? Who respects me enough and actually wants me and only me?

He said I could also do the same and have a hoe phase myself but I've never been the casual type and have only ever wanted to be loyal to him. He also said he knows he would feel like shit if the roles were reversed and understands if I would want to leave. But if he truly knew it would hurt so much, then why is he doing it to me? Does he just not care or does he really need this *that* bad?

**TL;DR** My boyfriend of two years is having a hoe phase, isn't there for me, but I love him and he did make me happy for two whole years. Not sure if waiting is romantic or just stupid.

So I know I asked a lot of questions here, but the main ones I really need some advice on are:

I can’t separate sex from real life and think that they actually might not respect me or care about me as a person if they want to do this. I also equate domination with low empathy because I can’t imagine someone wanting to hurt and cause damage to someone else - even though I know this is irrational.

The problem is, it’s effecting my relationship. My boyfriend loves bondage porn. He wants to try free-use and fantasises about using me. Sometimes, and I can’t control it, I get into panic attacks about the thought of being degraded or disrespected which has cropped up every so often for 4 years.

Recently, knowing he finds butt plugs hot, I looked them up on the subreddit and saw all these girls bent over saying really submissive stuff. I started panicking thinking that he wanted me to do that (even though I knew he didn’t and it was completely irrational) and started crying. I told him all this, telling him I didn’t want to act like a prostitute and I wanted to be myself. He knew I was having the panic attack and thinks it’s unhealthy - and I know it is.

He’s also not pressuring me into these sex acts, I’m pressuring myself because I want to be a perfect girlfriend. I’ve spent too long on reddit and see comments from guys joking that people will look outside the relationship to get those kinks and I’ve internalised that. I also know most other women enjoy being submissive and it terrifies me and I feel like I’m not normal and I need to compete with them to be the submissive pornstar of my partners dreams. I don’t want to leave him disappointed that I don’t do this stuff.

But, the idea of being degraded or objectified and losing power makes me upset and terrifies me. I get panic attacks at the though I should or must do this to make someone happy.

I actually really like it and i thought he did too. Sometimes when i do it he pushes my head down a little bit and i will admit it is a turn on. A few days ago though he pushed too hard and I choked and a ton of spit came out. It hurt and i felt disgusting. 

He said sorry but he has always wanted to ""throat fuck"" me and he likes the choking sound. I know that he watches porn and i know they do that kind of stuff but i don't think it's normal. I feel it is an extreme form of sex that a lot of girls won't do and do not like.

So i told him nobody does that in real life, which was a mistake because i think i kink-shamed him and that made him upset and say that his ex girlfriend used to do it. This made my heart sink. I went back to giving him a blow job because i didn't want to just leave him like that. (he didn't try to ""throat fuck"" me again btw)

The whole time all i could think about was her going down on him and how he probably wished I was doing it like her. All night i was imaging the two of them doing all the crazy things you see in porn. She's way prettier than me and a lot more outgoing and I've always been insecure about it. He has no idea how I feel because i don't want to bring it up. I just want to forget about it. How do I stop thinking about this? Should i just let him ""throat fuck"" me? (god i hate that stupid phrase)

I've been talking to women on reddit from /r/sex who say that they learned how to do it by practicing so maybe that is something i can do. Also  pretty much all of them are saying that they don't like it but do it to make their bfs happy. So i guess it's normal not to like it.

I think the big problem here is porn. It gave him a warped view of what sex is. He basically thinks sex starts with a blow job, then missionary, doggy style, transition to anal, and the facial. The last two things i will not do. He also watches hardcore stuff like gang bangs, fisting, rape play, ect. I hate that he has such a skewed view of the reality of sex.

He does this thing where he asks for sex like days in advance and I have to tell him “that’s not how that works” even tonight he just asked me “are you going to hungry in half an hour?” And my roommate M was like “R you can’t ask that how’s she gonna know???” And I agreed with him because you really can ask about anything in advance unless you’re making some plans. He knows I’m on multiple meds (birth control, antidepressants, etc) and I told him that my sex drive would be lowered, not that it was super high before. It’s not like he’s pressuring me but I feel like he’s guilt tripping me but doesn’t know it? Except he apologized because he said last night “I don’t wanna make you feel guilty but I just haven’t seen you in a while and I just really missed you” I didn’t give in completely we just made out and then clearly he wanted to take it farther bc he started doing the things I like but I still just wasn’t into it and I told him that and he backed off but then he did it again later and got kinda sad when I told him to back off (not that I gave in again tho bc I wasn’t doing that again that was lame lmao) 

     I feel like he’d still be on me about it if I didn’t 1. Pull a muscle in both my legs 2. Start my period so I’m kinda glad that happened but at the same time like why is that what it takes for him to take no for an answer like what the hell? I mean yeah we don’t have sex often because 1. We don’t see each other super often 2. I’m on a bunch of meds 3. The sex isn’t even that great I told him I like it rough sometimes and it seems low that’s all he does, he doesn’t know how to finger bc the last time he did I started bleeding and now I am a bit traumatized bc there a lot of blood and I don’t want that shit happening again, obviously I little variety in my sex but it would soo motivate me a bit more if we’re yknow... worth the effort. In the 3 years We’ve been together I have not cum once, it doesn’t seem like he has any interest in getting me to do that and tbh getting myself off is a better time anyway. So I’m really not even motivated to even have sex with him anymore which will be detrimental hopefully the next time we’re in the mood together I will talk to him before we follow through with anything but I don’t exactly know how but I guess we can cross that bridge when we see it. 

    Honestly this might be the effect of my meds but I also just don’t miss sex with him, it’s sounds but hit it is bad like its actually lame. He’s a 2 position kind of guy and that’s missionary and me on top, I asked if we could try a different position and he was like “we can try doggy” and we got into position and he was like ”woah something smells weird outside” and then suddenly wasn’t in the mood for doggy anymore and I have no idea why, nothing smelled weird, we had both just gotten out of the shower so it was either of us so I have no idea what his deal was this was September of 2020 so yes it was a few months ago but he’s been gone from me since early October. I think he’s also a bit sex crazed in general because early in our relationship I found a ton of porn on his phone in his pictures and his safari multiple times, I found out at one point he was jerking off to one of our mutual friends which was a whole ordeal I hated both of them for like a month bc I thought he was cheating on me but it just turns out he was being disgusting and the fact that consistently when we video chat or are snapping back and forth for more then like 10 minutes he asks if we “want to do anything” which the answer is always no, I sent him a metric ton of nudes over the summer during quarantine so I already broke my rule of doing that but if it would get him to get off my dick then fucking fine whatever I can break my own rules, but I think he’s a little crazy that way. It’s just such a lame situation but I don’t want to break up over it but like tbh idk how I feel about this relationship either, I have a lot of feelings that I have no idea what to do with it’s kind of a fuckin mess up in the dome not even gonna cap on that statement. He does nice things and I like spending time with him but sometimes it’s annoying and he’ll catch on that and back off, but after we have an argument and I want to just not talk about it anymore he keeps bringing stuff up and it’s like can we please just go like one time of us together not having beef the whole time like please drop it. 
     
     I don’t know, there is a lot going on and not a whole lot being done about it because I don’t know where to start so if anyone stuck around and has any advice in any of it please let me know I am definitely willing to talk about it if it’ll get me any closer to an answer.

I'd like to assume that we enjoy each other's company, but my girlfriend has brought up the issue that we may be basing our feelings entirely on the physical portion of our relationship. I don't really know how to answer this question, but we've done everything but sex (although sex doesn't seem out of the equation when things get hot and heavy I simply never have any condoms on hand).

When this problem is addressed I always discuss taking a break from any intense physical moments to prove that it's not what the relationship is founded on; however, every time we try doing this we end up failing fairly quickly within the week. Personally, I'm not concerned with this fact as the thought of being with her and talking to her is what makes my heart skip a beat not anything sexual, but I'm trying to give her an answer that will make her feel better.

I really do care about her but I don't know whether or not that conclusion about our relationship says something about how she feels about me. I never question whether or not, what I like to call expressing our love physically, is a bad thing for us, but clearly she feels used when the actions take place. Am I approaching the sexual times all wrong? I try my best to ask her if she's enjoying it and if she wants something. I never introduce new things without consulting her and I always get consent. Is there anything I can say or do to make her feel better or is this solely something on her side? I try my best to reassure her that I love her for her and not for anything physical that comes out of her, but I don't know.

tldr; I don't like my body proportions, specifically my butt. My partner does. I don't know how to tell him that I'm uncomfortable with my own body even though he likes it.

So I've been dating this guy for a little more than three months now and he's basically the perfect boyfriend, everything a girl could ask for. I love him lots, both as a friend and as a partner, and I definitely trust him. We've had sex and he's pretty obviously into my body both during and outside of the bedroom, but I can't help but feel a little grossed out by myself whenever he brings attention to any body part below the belt. This probably stems from mild dysphoria because I really am quite uncomfortable with having female parts, boobs, wide hips, etc. (To clarify, I identify as gender neutral, but I don't mind being referred to as female because, y'know, social safety.)

I have what is apparently a ""curvy"" body with a very small waist and wide hips. It makes my butt extra large and I hate it so much. I struggle to find pants in my size because my butt and thighs are so disproportionate to the rest of my body. No matter how much I diet or exercise it doesn't help because my body structure just makes my hips absurdly wide relative to everything. It's been the source of a lot of my body image issues through my teenage years. I'm turning 20 this year and while I've stopped believing that I'm unattractive my disgust at my female body hits every time my period nears, and especially when I put on pants that are tight at the butt but otherwise *perfectly proportional* to me. I don't own any full length mirrors and avoid looking in them because it always makes me feel bad about my fucking ass.

Anyway, he really loves my butt. No idea why, but he does. It doesn't make me uncomfortable that he likes it, it just makes me uncomfortable that I own it. I have no idea how to tell him this because it sounds like something stupid to tell anyone, I don't know if it's even something I should tell anyone or if I should just get over it. The few people I've ever mentioned anything about this to have said that I should be grateful to have this kind of fucked up proportions because it's sexy, but I genuinely don't see how this is sexy at all. I'd rather be androgynous than have to deal with the struggle of finding clothes I can wear and be comfortable in.

I just needed to vent about this. It's a really small petty thing, and I'm sure I'll figure it out eventually.

So my best friend of 6 going on 7 years has been dating their partner for 9 months. Their entire relationship has just been odd, they met and started their relationship while they were dating other people, only coming out as official after John's girlfriend told them that she had been cheating on him with his best friend (that's rough buddy) Since then we have been forced to hang around each other and we have not gelled in the slightest. It just seems like he is always trying to one up Rachel and I's relationship. Me and Rachel are very affectionate so we often hug or hold hands .

I hold her hand he holds her other hand. I give her a hug he must hug her as well. I lean into her he must put his arms around her. Rachel also has a habit of including him into our plans at last minute, me not knowing he is even showing up till they are on the way. Or her dropping plans with me at last minute (sometimes an hour) before we are supposed to meet up because he is needy or lonely. He is also uncomfortably open with me about their sex life (Rachel is too but to a way lesser extent) like he will ask me about what she likes to do in bed (how the hell would i know) anything she might has said to me about things they could do together. And things along the vain about he could only have sex with her because he loves her but is strangely interested in my opinion about his sex skills (his words) .

He also smells my pillows and likes to touch my things (knick knacks but still) and often asks what perfume I'm wearing so he can buy it for Rachel. IDK he just drives me crazy always looking down on me and judging me while pretending he a nice guy. It just feels like he is always trying to one up me or talk down to me. My family and friends say I should just pretend to like him till asked for my opinion or I'm an unsupportive and toxic friend. But I can not for the life of me get along with John.

Hello everybody. I really rarely post on reddit but this has been eating away at me.

In late August of 2020, I, 17 at the time (and considered underage in my state), was sexually assaulted by a sophomore at my school (19F) that I had pretty much had just met. I started at my new college as a freshman a week prior and I barely knew anyone since it's a small school and far from where I live. She started messaging me on social media before school even started and really, truly acted like she wanted to be my friend. She didn't live far from me at all as well; I had no reason not to trust her. She sent me some awkward sexual jokes but I kind of just laughed it off figuring it was her personality. We had hung out the first night of college without incident; again, some awkward sexual jokes but we mostly just watched TV and ate snacks.

The Saturday night after this benign interaction, she once again asked to hang out, this time saying she had wine and snacks. She made a mention of having sex toys but I made it *CLEAR* I was both underage and not interested in having sex with her. She sincerely apologized and I did come over because it seemed like she understood my boundaries. Once I got there, she asked if I wanted her friend to come over as a ""barrier"" to prevent her from making sexual advances on me. I had never heard of that concept before but I didn't think much of it, so I said ""no"" because I have a hard time meeting new people. (In hindsight this was a MAJOR red flag. I have MANY straight male friends and they have NEVER done such a thing.) She gave me this long talk about consent and stuff so I trusted her, and I had been drinking because she made it clear she wouldn't take advantage of me. Then she began talking about her BDSM fantasy stuff, and made a comment about my breasts, and I again made it clear I was 17 and not interested in sex with her. When she realized I was going to leave she assaulted me before I could.

**Trigger warning for sexual assault details - covered just in case**

It is quite painful and traumatic for me to fully relive what happened but to make a long story short,&gt;! I was sitting on her couch and she forcibly restrained me (she was much heavier and physically stronger than me), tied my wrists, took my pants off, and used various sex toys on me despite me repeatedly telling her not to. She bit my breasts and left marks and also forced me to look into her eyes while she did it. At some point I just gave up and let her do it because I could not physically fight back. !&lt;

After this happened she had friends over like it was a normal hangout and I made up some lie about my roommate needing help with something (my roommate works all weekend so she was not on campus) and immediately left. I had called my best friend (let's call him K), crying, telling him what had happened. I don't completely remember what I told him but he basically comforted me and said it was fucked up what happened.

Every time I tried to talk about my assault after this he laughed it off and told me to get over it, or just asked why I'm talking about the same thing over and over if it was one event. I always left him on read or just ignored him and changed the subject. One day I made an art piece about my trauma (I had been seeing a counselor about it and she suggested to make art) and when I posted it on my private Snapchat story he called me emo and told me to stop being so dramatic. At this point, I snapped. He had been doing other troublesome things too, but mostly just minor things that got on my nerves, like one-upping me or making comments on my appearance. I blocked him on everything. Whenever I have told him his behavior bothers me in the past, he immediately plays the victim and accuses me of trying to break off this years long friendship. I literally cannot bring a single issue up to him without him getting angry and defensive. (I was raised by a narcissistic father so I am used to this behavior)

One day I unblocked him and told me how what he said made me very upset. He told me I was asking for it by still going to her dorm and drinking when she had set out sexual pretenses and that I wasn't assaulted because it was a female (I'm bisexual). He said I could've fought back or left but I obviously wanted it because I didn't. He asked what I was wearing (which, by the way, was an oversized T shirt, men's cargo shorts, and hiking boots) Then after dropping this bomb he immediately just acted like we were best friends again.

That completely destroyed our relationship. I have him in my life but I hold him at an arm's length. I do not have him on my finsta or private story and I never talk to him about my issues anymore. I don't hang out with him or talk to him on the phone anymore. His comments still completely set me back in recovery, though. I still keep thinking it was my fault. I have barely told anyone what happened, only telling my mom months after it happened. I feel like I am not a ""real"" survivor. And I know his comments shouldn't hurt but they do; he was the first and one of the only people, beyond my therapist and RA, I told.

I don't know what to do. I think I did the right choice by not letting him back into my private life but I really wish I could mend this relationship.

Should I just have these high walls around him indefinitely, or cut him off until I heal enough that it doesn't haunt me anymore? What do I do?

So when I was younger I liked to take photos/videos of me and my girlfriend during sexy times, unfortunately around the same time we were days away from moving in together. We had recently visited the house and took plenty of pictures - you can probably see where this is going...
I was on a late shift at work with ""Bob"", we had worked together for a few years and got on well, occasionally going out for drinks etc on the weekend. This day was like any other, we were chatting about random things when I mentioned the house. I pulled my phone out to show him some pictures, I had them on fullscreen, slowly swiping through them ""Here's the garden, the garage is full of old junk, front room is decent.."" Awkward silence ""I... umm.. shit"". I swiped across to a picture of my girlfriend with her mouth full of.. well, me..

We both sort of froze for a few seconds while we processed what we were looking at, he just said ""are you fucking serious?!"" and walked off! As I said, we got along well but I was terrified of him reporting me. He came back a few minutes later and just said ""I can't believe you just did that"", I said how sorry I was but the damage was done.
After that night there was always a bit of awkwardness between us, we didn't go out on the weekends again but he didn't report me or mention it to anyone (that I know of). He left the company for another job about a year later.

I haven't seen him since but I wonder what he would say if we bumped into each other now...

He seemed to change overnight when this 2021 lockdown kicked in again though, and suddenly he was back in his office tapping away at his computer for hours and hours on end.

I never usually look at what he's written but I have absolutely nothing else to do at the moment and I was proud of him, so I opened the work folder on his laptop and the most recent word doc was called - I swear to God - ""The erotic adventure of Professor Chris Whitty"".

Recently I found out that (I’m sorry I snooped just a little but he literally left his phone opened while he was asleep) he’d been looking at other girls’ nudes. Which I would’ve been okay with if they were PORN stuff you find at a porn site but no, most of the requests had to be retweeted on Twitter to show “support for the girl” or they had to be requested by men in a forum. He followed so many girls on Twitter who are actively posting very sleazy and seductive photos (some for profit, some just to please men for attention), as well as tons of 3some accounts. His browser search history is FILLED with requests to see nudes from sexy and HOT real life girls (not porn stars), cheat sheets to see the lists of girls (apparently it’s not cheap or easy to do so I think), leaked stuff from social media influencers, hot girls and just local porn porn porn porn.

 Uh, where to begin, the story is going to be long, so first of all let me come up with names to make it a little easier. (Those are not real names)
Emma - best? friend
Anna - my gf

And you better get some tea, it's not going to be a 2min read.

So, um, the story begins long ago, when I was only 14. I was that kind of a guy in school that everybody likes, sort of the heart of every party, always in the middle of attention, etc. I never really had many male friends, all of friends were girls. I didn't like them in terms of relationships, I just was having a better time with that girls' attention. Anyway, I'm 14, another year in school, everything seems normal but one thing. There is a new girl in our class - Emma. She is very pretty, and very different from other girls in the class. She would argue with teachers, be mean, and all of that kind of things. I never liked people like that, but for some reason I, right away got a crush on her. 
Me being me, I easily became friends with her. I though that there is no way she would date me or anything like that, just because she was so different from any other girls that I could easily make to like me. Every other guy in school (exaggerating here a little) started going for her, while we just became very good friends. We would spend days together, just messing around, there were some hints that she likes me, but me being 14, I didn't realize that. 
Anyway, at some point she got a bf, I was helping her with some problems that she would encounter while with him, baically being in that friendzone area, from which I didn't really want to get out. So the time passed, and my crush on her became even bigger. I was trying to do something, but nothing helped. She broke up with that bf she had.
Than, the first big problem happened. She had to go back where she moved from, another city, which wasn't that far away, but still. She told me that she is leaving and I felt horrible. She gave me a hug, FIRST HUG, before I saw her last time, and then she left. It was april. 
I wrote her a message, confessing that I always liked her and everything that I felt. At the end of that message I told her: ""If you want to keep talking, that's great, but if you don't, just send me a photo of you, so I at least have something to remember"". Guess what? She sent a photo. 
I got so depressed. I wouldn't eat, sleep, and was downed all the time. It was particularly hard to not show all of that in school.
 Anyway, 2 months passed, I kind of got over it. It's summer 2016, I'm just wasting my time doing some teenager things. I also got a new girlfriend (not Anna yet), let's say - Jane. Things were going good. Jane doesn't play a very important role in this story, so it doesn't worth talking much about her. Summer has passed and I forgot about Emma. School has started, nothing seems off. And, then, in December, you know what happens? Emma messages me, after a little chat, she tolds me that, dud, she realized that she LIKED ME ALL THAT TIME. I'm blown away. I just managed to forget her, just managed to stop liking her, and this happens. I told her that I have a gf, and we can't do much about that. So we just keep talking a little now and again. 
In March, Jane cheats on me, I didn't care much, because after that depression I had, I stopped caring about things, whatever they might be. 
I didn't run to Emma right away, we were still talking but now I saw a chance of some sort, but I still was afraid after what she had put me through. In summer we get closer, spend every day together. It was the time I had my first ever sex, she was experienced in that, and me being very talkative, it wasn't at all bad. Just a good one, as friends (yeah, i know, weird). As it was my first sex, without any protection, I felt nervous afterwards, and maybe some part of me deep down wanted some sort of a revenge. 
At the end of the summer I told her thay I can't be with her, without giving her any reason why. Forgot to say, she had to move to the city I am in for the summer, so that's how we managed to spend time together. And some time in the autumn she had to move away, again. But at this time, she was only 40 - 50 minutes away from me by a bus. And her step father had an apartment that she would visit occasionally very close to my home.
I felt peace, I don't know why, it was very strange time. 
School starts, and, you guessed it, I couldn't stop thinking about her, so after few months, we started talking again. She was with another guy, and that made me less anxious, because i thought that gives me less chances of hurting myself again by getting close with her another time. 
We were talking alot. I was helping her with her bf, as that's what I do with all of my female friends. :p
Nothing unusual happens, I finally accepted the fact that we are just very good friends. 
And here it comes - Anna finally enters the story. Another new girl in class, with which it only took me 1 month to become close enough. We started dating in February 2018. She is literally my dream girl, and everything about her is perfect. I still talk with Emma, and everything seems good, finally! (Or so I thought...) 
At the end of summer 2018 I had to leave to study in UK. And so I did. It was tough time for me to be that far away from home, but I would still go back home on holidays. I was talking with Anna, and with Emma. Emma had a very strange bf, he was an okay lad, but just a little strange. So, being alone in UK, without Anna close to me I started thinking of Emma more and more. I was waiting for a message from her more than from Anna. And that's not because I like her more, it's just, the curiosity. 
In 2019, on holidays I went back home. At some point I had to go and pick up my guitar from my mate who was living pretty far away. And I decided to meet with Emma, because I haven't seen her for so long. She broke up with her bf around a month ago.We met at a shopping centre, and oh boy, it was so clear that she was so nervous, she was shaking and behaving weird, I, tbh, was the same. We spent like an hour together, and, we almost kissed. Which was so awkward. I had to lie to Anna that I was stuck in traffic to somehow explain why I got home late. (She new about Emma, but she only knew that we were friends from a while ago). I don't know if I would call this cheating, you call it whatever, it gets worse, believe me. 
I went back to UK. And kept talking with Emma. Everything was still great with Anna. I went home at summer, talked very little with Emma, because I was always with Anna, the summer was a normal summer, nothing crzay happened. Same was the next school year, I kept going to UK and back home for holidays, and talked very little to Emma while at home, just because I was spending all of my time with Anna. I went home at Christmas holidays of 2019, after which I came back to UK, where I was stuck untill September 2020 due to covid.
Obviously I was talking a lot with Anna. And started talking a lot with Emma. She, again got a new bf, who she is still with today. I would not call they relationships perfect, she was complaining to me sometimes and ask me for advice, through our chats we would occasionally joke about us being together. Sometimes she would get drunk and tell me how important I am to her and how she feels bad for everything that was between us. Sometimes I would get drunk and tell her pretty much the same. But it was clear that there is still something between us. There was a big oof after which we didn't speak for 3 weeks. It's her bf being jealous. At some point I thought it was the end, but no, everything got figured out. 
I finally came back home in September. Met with Anna, all was good. We started to live together with her, we were doing that everytime I was on holidays, but now I just got a new good appartament that I can rent. 
Here is where it gets crazy.
So, in October, Emma went to her parents house that's like 10 minutes by taxi from my place. She had to look after the dog because her parents left to their friends. Anna was at work, I told her that I will go visit Emma, but I did say that she would be there with a friend. 
Emma told me, that her friend (female) will come to watch us and to prevent anything crazy from happening. She also said that they will stay there over night as her parents will come home next day evening. I went to shop, got some good ass wine (Pinotage, if you are interested). And got to Emma. As obvious as it can be, her friend never came. We had the wine, talked, watched some TV. She was sitting on a couch and i was lying on her, in a T shape. We were watching simpsons, talking and vaping. She asked me for a vape, and, once she took it, she leaned towards me, mouth to mouth, and exhaled. We didn't kiss, but oh god my heart started beating like crazy. We continued to sit like that and talk, then she had to get up to feed a dog. She did, i did as well. She fed the dog, came back to the couch, and, I couldn't hold myself. I took her by the arm, moved her closer to me, and kissed. Oh my god it was so romantic. We were kissing for around 2 minutes. After we stopped she said: ""I don't think this is right"". To what I replied:"" What's wrong with 2 people in love kissing eachother?"" We sat on a couch and were sitting in silence watching TV, hugging, and just being cute. I don't see the point of holding it longer, we then moved to a bed, and had sex. Very good sex. She was sceptical about it at first, but she then started it herself. 
First she wanted me to stay overnight, before sex, but then, she casually said that she never gets any time by herself, and asked me if I want to go or stay. I obviously wanted to stay, but I decided to leave, because, first: Anna was waiting for me, and second: it was clear that Emma wanted to be left alone. It was 3am. 
I took a taxi home. Told Anna that it all went good, told her that there also was Emma's friend, so there is nothing to worry about.
Next day I ask Emma how she feels. She said that she felt horrible because she cheated, that she was driving home in a taxi and crying. I calmed her down, and she asked me to keep this only between us, as I tend to be open about what I do in my life with Anna. (It might not sound like that, but wait till the end of the story)
We kept talking with Emma, and life was going normal. I invited her with her bf to get wasted with us, and bunch of my and Anna's friends. I meet Emma's bf, let's say - John. We got drunk af, became good friends. All was going good. Sometimes people would go to toilet to talk about stuff. We called it a 'Soul room' haha, anyway, i was drunk like crazy in the soul room, Emma came in, we started talking, and she then kissed me several times. Of course nobody knew, as everyone thought we were just talking about some weird shit. 
After that, they came to my place a few times, we were doing normal friends stuff. 
But then, get ready.
They invited me and Anna to their place. Things went as normal, drinking, talking. At least the first night. Second night we got even more drunk and oh boy things went crazy and we ended up having a foursome. It was ok, strange experience, but will do. We also had a soul room at their place, which was weird because it was only 4 of us. Anna and Jonh got to know eachother a little better, and me with Emma had few secret kisses. Next day me with Anna went home, and Emma told me that John suspects some shit because I was telling him thay Emma is my bff and all of that.
I always was an open guy and speak about my feelings open. I also see nothing wrong in open relationships, and I was explaining to John my point of view about the world. How every person has it's own life, and you shouldn't make decisions for others and force them to do or not to do things in relationships. How you shouldn't mourn if you break up and all of that, just because there is no point. It all came to my head after that depression I had because of Emma. It changed my view on things entirely. 
Anyway, he didn't want me to send her messages with compliments, which I think is dumb. If I want to say things to a person who enjoys those things, why not? I told them that I will not change for THEIR relationships. He accepted it, and realized that it sounds logicall. We ended up on just me not sending Emma cute messages and all that. (Sounds stupid, I know) 
Also, I've forgotten to say that after the foursome, we had a chat with Emma in the soul room about what on earth should we do. She told me that she thinks I won't be able to be with her just because we are so different, but she still wants to be with me. And that we would have to keep it a secret, and keep being eachothers secret lovers. That we would still meet and do all the things we do, but in no way we go open about all of that. 
The next day that we came home, I spoke with Anna, I told her that I still have feelings to Emma, that we kissed several times while she was around. Told her about that one time I went to Emma. The only thing thay i didn't tell was the sex. Anna told me that she also had small affairs while I was in UK, and we were very chill about that. I don't see any problems in people having their own lives. So she know almost all now, and I know about her. 
Emma never told John anything, because they would break up right away, and she loves him. 
So, nowadays. Me and Anna are great, Emma and John are great. We haven't met since those 2 days, around 1.5 month. We don't speak with Emma that much, because she has to study and barely has any time to spend with me. 
It is also clear that she stopped messaging me. I mean at all. I ask her how is she she goes im ok. And it's like this every time I'm trying to start a chat. Doesn't go further than that. 
I looks like she's lost all of the feelings that she had towards me, but I can't figure out if it's that or it's just because she is really busy. I recently called them and invited them to celebrate new year, they said they would come, but they had things arranged with their friends. So they never did. 
I am trying to accept that it was all that what we were meant to go through, but the part of me thinks it's not quite over.

So, to conclude. I love Anna, she is perfect. She is better than Emma in most of things. Anna loves me and is very happy with my view on the world. She's moving towards the same understanding of the things around us. Which i quite like. But something in me tells me that I would be better off with Emma. And i sill have feelings for her, and they are very strong.

What would you think is the better thing to do? Do i just try to forget her? Or change my life completely? Which is not likely, because she seems to be somewhat happy with John.",0,0,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,nsfw,"I [M19] have feelings towards my best? friend [F19] while in a relationship with the love of my live [F19] and it's way more complicated than it sounds, it even gets to the point of a foursome, if that makes some of you interested.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/kulvrh/i_m19_have_feelings_towards_my_best_friend_f19/,promo_adult_nsfw,3.5

Background: Several months ago my friend admitted to being attracted to me. After telling him I wasn't interested, he said he still wanted to be friends. I said it was okay as long as those feelings weren't a strain on him. A few times since he has continued to bring up wanting to at least ""try"" doing something, even though I've turned him down.

Fast forward to today, he just visited me for the weekend. My apartment is very small (it's a studio and the bathroom isn't even fully closed off). On the second day, he told me he was experiencing discomfort due to the need to masturbate. He claimed to not have had time the day he traveled. Since he was going to stay for another day I told him to just do his business and I'll wait outside. And that was that.

It was around 3AM the last night it happened.

I woke up to my pants removed and his hand inside my underwear... his fingers inside me. I felt my heart stop and sink into my gut. My arms are buzzing with adrenaline. I reach behind me, grab his wrist, sit up and say ""Don't you ever fucking do that to me again."" He casually rolls over and pretends to sleep. HE PRETENDS TO SLEEP. So calm. So nonchalant.

I couldn't sleep after that. My entire body grew hot. Literally sweating with rage. I began to shake. Did that just happen? Was I ….assaulted? Surely no... he's my husband... It's not... no. No. I begin to fight with myself.

It's not assault.

Yes it is!

You never give him affection.

He doesn't deserve it nor does he get to TAKE IT!

It was a Friday morning and I had to go to work soon. I just needed to get some sleep or distract myself for a bit and then this would all go away. I could distract myself with work and calm down, but sleep wouldn't come back, and I was about to have a horrible day.

Once 6AM approached I began to get ready for work. He slept while I got ready. How is he sleeping? How is he so calm? I start getting ready faster. I'm going to just get ready, and go early. He wakes up right before I leave. Doesn't say a word to me. Just strolls by and begins to brush his teeth. He then grabs a cup of coffee and asks me some questions but I don't answer. Instead I begin to cry.

""Why did you do that to me?"" I ask.

""What are you talking about?"" he says.

""YOU ASSAULTED ME!"" I yell.

""I've never hit you!"" he says.

The conversations continues with me trying to explain that what he was doing was assault. He disagrees. He thinks sexual assault is only rape, pedophilia, or forcing a woman down on a man. I'm exhausted and flustered. I leave and head out to work.

I barely ate that day. Couldn't laugh at the office banter, skipped breaks, and stayed quiet. My friend and coworker noticed something off and so I confide in her. My voice breaking as I spoke. She knows my husband and was trying to have an optimistic view, but it made me feel worse, so I shut down again. I didn't want to hear optimism for the act that was destroying me from the inside out.

As I continued to work I reflected on his mannerism. Why was he so cavalier? Has he done this before? Then that horrible feeling came fleeting back. My heart sinking into my chest. This has happened before...

Flash back a year or so. My youngest is probably two. I'd been going to therapy and trying to overcome bad postpartum depression. I was on 2 different anti depressants at the time. It was a beautiful night. We'd had cocktails on the patio, grilled, had a fire, etc. The thing about drinking while on meds is that it FUCKS. YOU. UP. Sometimes I'd be drunk after 2 drinks. It was a rough time. This particular time I was fairly sober. My youngest asked if I'd lay with her until she fell asleep. I oblige.

Snuggled up and watching her favorite movie, I fall asleep.

I wake up around 1-2AM with my pants removed and my underwear down by my ankles. I'm halfway down the bed this time. I'm on my stomach... he's performing oral sex on me WHILE I SLEEP NEXT TO OUR TODDLER! I jump up and he just walks downstairs and goes to bed while I laid there putting myself back together. Confused and disgusted.

Convinced that my drinking and medication had something to do with it, I compartmentalized the memory under ""WTF Drinking decisions"" and never spoke of it. I had several times in my past where I'd drank too much and woke up on the bathroom floor, so I didn't think anything of it when the first time (or first time I remember) happened.

After the thought leaves me I'm even more angry than before. HOW LONG HAS THIS BEEN HAPPENING? I'm a deep sleeper... I've slept through intense thunderstorms before, but how long has he been doing this to me? How long has this man that I trusted, been sexually assaulting me in my most vulnerable state?

I get invited over thinking it will just be me and her, only to find that either of her partners is already there. While I am friendly with both of them, I am even friends with Ben from college,  but it is getting to the point where sometimes, even though I was invited, I feel like the third wheel. Or I don't even know what to expect now when I get invited out. 

Many times I will get invited over to hangout and watch movies. Jenna and her Sam will cuddle and kiss on the couch while we all watch tv together and I try to just ignore it or focus on my phone as I feel like I am intruding. I have even left the room only to walk back in to find them doing something else . It has even gotten to the point where Jenna has grabbed Sam's dick in front of me while we were eating out. I have even caught her licking Sam's grocery store while we were out shopping with other friends. I was facing their direction having a conversation with another friends and they were in clear eyeshot. It always seems to happen in front of me and I am tired of it. These are just a few of the moments I have been around.

I am tired of being invited to hang out as friends and then running into situations where I feel like I am intruding. I already had a conversation with her about this but it doesn't seem to be getting better. I am just mad and now when I get invited I am always questioning the intent. I did not consent to be around these private acts. I'm glad my friends are comfortable around me but when I come to hang out, I come to hang out as friends. The real kicker is she knows that this makes me feel uncomfortable.

Any advice on how to address these situations in the moment? I am awkward and I do not want to come off as rude. I do try inviting other friends to add balance to the situation but as you can tell from the grocery store incident, that doesn't always help. 

All names have been changed in this btw.

Also sorry, this is going to be long, a big part of this issue is that I experience psychosis and it's hard for me to tell if I'm losing my grip without sorting through all the context.

I should start by saying that I have never been happier in a relationship. I was in an extremely abusive situation (refuse to call it a relationship tbh) in my early to mid teens and an 8ish month relationship with a lovely girl in the latter half of high school when we realized we were basically just friends and ended it on good terms. This is my first ""adult"" relationship and he's my first (consensual) everything. 

We've been together almost two years now, since a short time before my 19th birthday. He's dated a bit before but for both of us this is our first serious, long-term grown up relationship. Obviously it's tricky to navigate in its own right but on top of that he's from a kinda messed up home and so am I, plus I deal with a variety of physical and mental conditions. But we have a lot of respect for one another and have been incredibly solid. We've helped each other work through a lot and grow as people.

We have this mutual friend who I'll call Rosie, who's the reason we met. Long story short, Rosie was in my orientation group and chiseled through my antisocial barrier until we became close friends and I moved to her hall. Her bf's (Jonah) friend who I'll call Martin started hanging around a lot more after meeting me and became my bf. Rosie and Jonah split up about a year ago now and we've been living together on campus with a couple other friends since.

2020 was kind of a mess from the start for us as Rosie and Jonah broke up in the middle of the academic year and were unable to change the housing arrangement. So, we all lived with a pair of exes for half a semester til Covid hit. It was more bearable than you'd think, but still not great, and we all realized Jonah was a shithead and have collectively stopped associating with him.

Now this past semester (Aug-Dec 2020) Rosie's been going through a lot of personal stuff as well as processing from her previous relationship and it does sort of feel weird being in a relationship when she isn't. The rest of my friends were in relationships before mine started and I'm never sure what's ok to talk about or even if it's acceptable to mention Martin at all when we're talking. She's still a dear friend though and I'm trying to be there for her and we hang out a lot aside from just being roommates.

Rosie and I were hanging out with our other friend ""Agnes"" and doing the usual weekend drinking/gossiping and the two of them started pressing me about Martin (they're both single now but have a lot more experience/generally are more sexual than me and were talking about that kinda stuff before). I don't wanna get too much into it but basically they were convinced that Martin has issues with toxic masculinity because he doesn't want me to touch his balls? 

I kinda laughed it off at the time because they were definitely drunk, but Rosie has pressed on with advice for how to get him to let me do it, theorizing about what it means about him psychologically, even telling me ""you have to just do it and he'll realize he likes it but if you give him warning you'll never get the chance."" I honestly do not care and I know Martin is incredibly ticklish and would not find it enjoyable, tbh it's a bit of a joke between us how potently vanilla he is but I truly am not bothered by it. Rosie has been genuinely concerned for the quality of our relationship and thinks we won't last because of this.

A quick list of other examples:

• I cook and bake a lot. Martin helps, and does it himself sometimes, but I really enjoy making him food. Rosie thinks he needs to grow up and not get used to being served. 

• I bought Martin a new camera for his birthday - he's a photographer but his camera was stolen shortly after we got together. Rosie points out he spends way less money on me and suggests he doesn't value me as much as I do him.

• Martin has a weekly video game night with his friends from home. Sometimes during this I'm bored/have nothing to do, Rosie suggests he's being neglectful.

• When we're intimate Martin doesn't perform oral or use his hands on me. I have severe trauma with those forms of intimacy and this is at my request. Rosie suggests he's with me because I don't have those expectations of him.

I know that I feel happy with Martin. We treat each other really well and he takes such good care of me when I have issues with mental and physical health. I also know that my experience of relationships is extremely skewed and I have no idea what counts as ""normal"" or healthy, especially since Martin and I kind of jumped right into cohabitation. It's been good and we've never fought or anything but Rosie and Agnes have said it's normal and expected to fight and it's only because I haven't established any boundaries.

Basically I'm losing my mind, I have no idea if I'm making excuses for Martin or if my extremely suggestible and inexperienced nature is making me have relationship doubts when I shouldn't. My brain is all tied up and lately I've gone down a total paranoid/compulsive spiral. Sorry I know this post is long, I'm going to end it here but I'll be as active as I can in comments if anyone has questions.

TLDR: I'm in my first long term adult relationship. I feel great about how things are going but some friends are concerned and my basis for relationships is totally wacked out by prior experience with abuse and mental illness. I have no idea if I'm ignoring things that should be concerning or if Rosie is off base and I just need an outside perspective.

I said nothing about it. I quickly found the snow blower, added it to cart and told him to type everything else in himself. I really need to teach this man the wonders of incognito.

Me (23F) and my boyfriend (22M) have been together for 5 years (UK).

Before being with my boyfriend, I was in a very unhealthy relationship with someone who didn't take my sexual boundaries very seriously. I was very young and didn't know how much it had affected me until I left him a year and a half later.

This is something that happened a little over a year ago, early December 2019. It's not a memory that comes up often, but every now and again, it makes me pause for reflection on what could have been.

I'm someone who struggles alot with mental health, particularly intrusive thoughts. I won't go into the long and detailed history of how my mind became such an entangled mess, but let's just say that, due to relentless bullying in my childhood and teen years, I have thought of, and even attempted suicide multiple times in recent years.

This event happened when I was returning home from a Devin Townsend gig in Manchester. I'd had a great time, but unfortunately had missed the last train home. So, I decided to take a late bus back to a point near to where I live, and agreed with my dad to be picked up the rest of the way.

A good portion of the trip was uneventful. I was sat on the top deck, using one of the tables to read one of the big World of Warcraft lore books. When suddenly, just as we were getting up to speed on a section of motorway, the bus came to an abrupt stop.

I didn't see the impact, and because I was listening to music as well, I didn't hear anything unusual, either. It was only when I went down to investigate what was the hold up when another passenger told me why we'd stopped.

""We've hit someone.""

My first reaction was along the lines of ""Wait, what?""

Then I noticed that the bus' windscreen was shattered, and the driver, along with the passengers were standing outside. I grabbed my stuff, and when I exited the bus, I saw a woman, laying splayed out on the asphalt. There was no blood, no obvious signs of broken bones, but she was motionless.

I didn't say anything. What **could** I say? This was so unexpected, I just drew a complete blank.

The paramedics and police arrived soon after. The ambulance crew did their usual stuff, checking for a pulse, shining a light in her eyes etc. Soon, they took her away on a stretcher, and though my memory at this point isn't as clear, I'm pretty certain that the bag they put her in went over her face. So while I never got explicit conformation, I think it's safe to say that she didn't survive.

I don't know what had possessed her to jump in front of a bus, or why. All I knew was that two people, who I guessed were either friends or family, were staring on in shock.

I rung my dad to tell him what happened, and that I'd need to be picked up due to the exceptional circumstances (and the fact it was past 11pm at this point). Unfortunately, in a moment worthy of r/tifu, the fact that I'm hard of hearing and sometimes don't notice how loud I'm speaking gave the wrong impression, despite my attempts to word the situation carefully, and in a sensitive manner.

I'd managed to say ""There's been a horrible accident..."" before a police officer approached me. Thankfully, no charges were pressed, and I managed to spit out the remainder of the necessary info before hanging up. I can only imagine how insensitive I must have looked to the kin of the victim, some guy loudly gossping about how someone close to them got hit by a bus.

I considered apologising to the couple directly, but thought better of it. Emotions were already high enough, and I didn't want to start a fight by misspeaking a second time. As for how I felt about the whole thing? I tried to be casual and positive to the others, making idle chitchat before going back to my music and waiting at a nearby bus stop. But as a whole, I just, sort of didn't feel.

I wasn't sad, but I wasn't happy either. I wasn't feeling triggered (not in the angry sense, but in a trauma sense), yet it did dampen my spirits a little. I suppose being on such a high after a metal concert helped me keep my head on straight about the whole thing.

To this day, I'm still not 100% sure how I felt about it. It was a thing that happened. One that I never expected to witness, but who does? I had much bigger stuff to feel shit about a couple or so weeks later (with the UK snap election results), but that's a whole different can of worms I'd rather not go into right now.

If there is one positive outcome of the whole thing, it's that I have latched on to a particular phrase that I've come back to many times throughout 2020. ""I choose life."" As hard as depression is, and as horrrible as 2020 was overall, there were still little moments that I treasure as blessings that have made me a better person overall. Learning to play bass guitar has helped me achieve musicianship I never thought I'd achieve, and coupled with my adorable pet Degus, I have plenty of reasons to live (to say nothing of my awesome friends and family).

I want to end this long, rambling post with a simple message to anyone else who has struggled with suicidal urges in their life: You are worthy. You are worth so much to many people, be it friends, family, pets or a combination of all three. You are not bad or selfish for feeling suicidal, and you will feel happiness again. It's never too late to reach out for help.

I screw it up by watching a graphic medical video with him next to me.

So I've been doing research on birth control methods (22F) and I've been curious about IUDs. I've heard both horror stories and harmless stories about the insertion process, so I wanted to see what it was like. I kept seeing animations, and I, for some reason, wanted to see it on a real body. I looked for medical videos and found [this one](https://brooksidepress.org/brooksidepress/?page_id=209&amp;cn-reloaded=1) (Warning: NSFW, shows the vagina, cervix, blood, and all).

My boyfriend (22M) is sitting on the couch a seat cushion away from me not really paying attention to what I'm watching while he plays some game on his phone. So this video is loading (it's only 5 minutes but my internet is hella slow). So it starts, and this pleasant music starts playing and my boyfriend moves closer, puts his head on my shoulder, and asks what's that? He starts watching.

I was not sure what this video contained. But it goes in LIVE DETAIL. It starts out harmless enough, but then we get to the speculum being inserted and he bolts up right. Turns to me and says, ""The fuck? Doesn't that hurt??"" I assure him it's routine, can hurt sometimes, but is generally NBD. It...continues. The cervical sound gets inserted and he looks like he's going to faint and throw up at the same time. It doesn't help that there's blood after it gets removed; he's a little squeamish. I am not in any way, shape, or form a squeamish person. I don't fear blood. I do want to stress again that I did not know what to expect from this video and I did not want to purposely make my boyfriend feel horrified.   I pause the video and move to get up and he's like, ""No, this is life."" I am adamant that I am not about to clean up his vomit and this is not a way that he has to show some prideful masculinity or something. He tells me to stay and finish it because we might as well follow through. I tell him he doesn't have to follow through on anything because it would be happening to me. He says, ""I know. That shit looks like it's so painful. That metal thing goes INSIDE of you!"" And now I'm all freaked out. So he reaches over and presses play, and we watch the rest.

After the video he and I look at each other and I just nod and he is still speechless, still looks nauseated. I'm back on my search for a good birth control method for me.  A few hours later we're about to go to bed, and I'm still ready for sexy times because...PMS. The video didn't bother me too much. Dear boyfriend on the other hand stops me from touching him right away, looks me dead in the eye, and says, ""I literally cannot get that image out of my head. I'm sorry babe. It's not happening tonight.""

Reddit, I think I've traumatized him. I'm going to talk to him, of course. But I had no idea that it would affect him that much.

ETA: I used a throwaway not because he's on here (he isn't) but because I have family members that know my reddit account and I, um, would rather not share this particular story with them.

He is lying flat on his back with me on top of him. It does not take long until he pulls my head away signaling he is going to cum, he also sits up slightly in his seconds before orgasm. I continue with my hand until he begins to cum, not thinking much about where it will end up. As soon as he starts cumming I am reminded how much of a shooter he is. This man shoots his load farther than anyone else I have been with. Just as soon as that thought pops into my mind, I look at him and see his cum shoot directly into his mouth. We immediately start dying of laughter. I have always wondered if this exact thing ever happens to people, and today I got to experience it first hand.

Me and him have been on and off for about 4 years. We started dating in middle school and dated through high school. Things did get toxic between us in the past (explains the on and off) and every time I broke up with him, he came back, said he wanted to be together and change the behaviors that I didn't like. One time we broke up and completely stopped talking to each other and some how ended up together (around the two year mark). Things have been a lot heathier but  I did take breaks from me getting stressed out.

One of the main issues that I had was holding on to the past. Before we had gotten together I had been sexually assaulted by my step father (at the time). Which made my want to lose my virginity, I had a fear of being raped by him. Me and my ex ended up losing our virginities to each other young. Later on, he was interested in doing anal, which I was unsure about. He brought it up a lot and we   
ended up doing it. I consented to it, I just kind of regret it and it still bothers me (uncomfortable experience, should've waited until I was completely sure). When I think about the situation, sometimes I feel anxious to talk to him, or about my other situation. 

Majority of the time being around him, I am comfortable though. I do want to be with him, I just hate the on and off. We tried being together again in December and I felt like things happened too fast. It was like we had an intense honeymoon stage that went out pretty fast. He got distant and didn't communicate his feelings with me. He said he feels like he can't sometimes. When I started thinking about the past situation and talked to him about it, he got upset with me. We did talk about how pushy he was being and he did apologize for it, stopped the behavior. He started to talk to me less on the phone, getting very distant. I didn't know how to feel. I also didn't like it. It felt like he wasn't even trying with me.

I ended up breaking up with him because of my overthinking and him going through stuff. I wasn't going to help him get better, I have my own stuff going on. I told him until he works on things himself for himself (self-esteem, mood swings) we'd never be stable. I felt like I loved him more than he loved himself, which now I know is a big NO. He said ""I'm not going to stop you for doing what's best for you"" when we broke up. It made me feel like he didn't care

After the break up I stopped talking to him for a couple of days but I had to ask him for something. Turns out he still wants to be together, I told him we are not ready to be together. Especially with both of our mental health. I feel like he has some maturing to do. He says he wants to do better for himself and me. So far he's been better, but its only been a couple of days. We started hanging out again for his birthday, though I enjoyed the time with him, I didn't really want to be affectionate. I told him some days I want to be but a lot of others I don't, which is unfair to him so I don't want to. He still shows affection to me and I don't know how to feel about it. It's nice to see that he wants me but I want to take things slow. How should I go about this? I like it but at the same time I don't know if that's appropriate right now, with just being friends. I told him that he doesn't have to be romantic and he wants to show me he'll be consistent. I mean yes, that's good in all but I don't want to get all in my feelings for him and deal with the same issues.

It was my second time having guests over and although I did remember to hide my fleshlight and my lube, I somehow forgot about my ""Fleshwash"" which is a fleshlight cleaner in the bathroom.

Anyways, although I wish I could say that one of my guests found out about the fleshlight instead of what happened, he didn't. He asked me if I had any soap left in the bathroom and I said there's some more in the kitchen and before I proceeded to grab it for him, he mentioned that there's hand sanitizer in the bathroom and asked if he could use it. I just thought I'd left my hand sanitizer in the bathroom so I told him to go ahead. About fifteen minutes later he went to wash his hands again for some reason, I just thought he'd spilled some drink onto himself or something but fast forward to today, I went back into the bathroom, needed some soap and looked for the hand sanitizer. I was thinking that he may have accidentally taken it while he was drunk but then I realised that the Fleshwash was not in its usual spot. I've never even had a hand sanitizer in my bathroom in the first place. I sincerely hope his hands are fine.

NSFW because talk of suicide threats. Throwaway from my main account because I'm at rock bottom of caring and I know it's not socially acceptable. I just need to vent so I can pull myself up. It's just been a long, long road and I'm just so tired.

It's been years and years of caretaking, hoping that maybe one day, with enough help, my ex-BFF will finally reach stability and start living and thriving. Become someone who doesn't just live to survive and seek their next fix. Someone who doesn't treat ""friends"" (term used loosely) as inexhaustible resources of time, emotional support, and money. Become someone who doesn't lie on the daily, the lies coming out so easily, and lie even more when confronted with their lies. Become someone who doesn't triangulate their friends into arguing with each other on whether we're caring for them enough, giving enough of ourselves or our money or time. Become someone who doesn't use suicide as a way to recruit people to lie for them when they are caught, because people are afraid the threats are real, you're always supposed to treat them as real, and some of us are just good, decent people trying to save a life. One day, I wish my ex-BFF would become someone who cares when they hurt people beyond some kind of self-centered shame that turns into another I'm-so-sad, please-take-care-of-me emotional paycheck they cash in to the next unwitting friend ATM.

I'm just tired. I went NC out of necessity but there are a few people still in the cycle it took me over a decade to wake up from.

There is a few things that I should explain, I am a male, but not exactly the straightest cookie, but I can't find the best thing for what I feel. I should also mention that I am insanely curious, but also at that age where people become extremely horny, (this will become sort of important later), I should also say that my mom is one of those people who are tough, yet you somehow can't stay mad at. I was also looking for a Halloween ""costume"" to wear, although I would also use it for a story I was writing as sort of a basis for event.

With all of that out of the way, I had been going around the house, looking for things to create this costume I wanted, I went through all the boxes and things to go to thrift store, there I found a top for what I needed. Now all I needed was a bottom, but referring to the curious part of the above, I decided to go into my moms room, I knew that there was a few things there that I would be needing, now I should say that none of the stuff I took was worn all that much due to the pandemic, so I got some leggings and shoes from the closet, I decided to snoop around a bit more, and at some point came to the drawer right next to my moms bed. Now I should say, that this drawer, I though contained a flashlight and some other emergency equipment, I had seen it open before when I was younger. I opened the drawer, not expecting much, and right there, I saw a butt plug, I could have guessed that some of the fabric had parted to expose it, but there it was. I stupidly decided to open it further, and Bam!, there was a dildo, right on top of some of the fabrics, that would turn out to be some, well very exposing clothes. I then decided it would be a good idea to dig further, I found a vibrator, and tons of lube, some of it had leaked, it was a slippery, gooey mess, and then there was a paddle with the text of ""Attitude Adjuster!"", I had seen this before in the time when I was younger. So you want to know what I decide to do, not close it and back away, but take it away to my room to experiment with them. I didn't ever do anything with them, and eventually returned them, but I would occasionally get really horny and want to get that dick back out for some more play. Oh wait, there was also some handcuffs that I took for the costume to go around my wrist, just both on one, but thats not exactly important. But this just sort of ruined my image of my mom, I couldn't just look at her the same knowing that she may have played around with this stiff, slimy dick in her younger years, and possibly now. The thought of her kinky times always just scared me, but I never expected that she would have these sort of things.

TL;DR: I went around looking for some cross dressing costume, and found my moms kinky toys

Edit: I just want to clear things up, I never used them, considered it, but never actually did it, also I made damn sure to take pictures of the scene to make sure I put them back where they were, so I really dont want my mom to find out, the handcuffs were at the back and there has been no suspicion, I am currently considering to return them, but I haven't gotten a chance yet.",0,0,tifu,t5_2to41,nsfw,TIFU by looking around a bit too much in my moms room,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/kpmpay/tifu_by_looking_around_a_bit_too_much_in_my_moms/,promo_adult_nsfw,7.0

The house is not mine nor my boyfriend’s but it’s his parent’s, who were gone last night. My boyfriend gets up and goes to the restroom and asks me for toilet paper which I thought was weird bc I had just put some in there. I went into our room and there was the toilet paper, sitting on the floor next to a bunch of waded up toilet paper that I can only assume was cum tissues.

This morning I walked into my room to get a change of clothes, and they both were presumably naked and hiding underneath the covers of my bed as if I interrupted something. This really pissed me off because I would never think to do something like that at one of their houses let alone in one of their beds, especially when I was trying to be a good guest and my boyfriend n I got like no sleep. I told them to pls pick up the tissues and come join my boyfriend, our other friend and I in the kitchen. They eventually did and I called them out on being naked in our bed to which the boyfriend just said yeah sorry and left it at that. When I’ve called them out before (example being if I told them to get off the bed so I could lay down) they always just act like I’m joking. This isn’t the first time they’ve disrespected the household or me n my bf (coming in while people were sleeping bc the door was left unlocked, making out in our bed, sleeping in our bed together during hangouts, making other ppl uncomfortable by going off on their own). They’ve been dating for under a year but have known each other for around 2, so I understand PDA but not this.

My boyfriend and I have been together almost 4 years and we’ve never done anything like this. AITA for being upset and verbally telling them I am? Would I also be the asshole if I declined to hang out with them as much bc it’s getting annoying?

I guess I’m just a little thrown off because clearly he is using this thing on himself and I don’t know if that’s a normal thing for a straight dude to do? We don’t do *butt stuff* with me. I’ve never done anal, tried and it hurt like hell. I’ve told him that and he’s never tried to do it with me. Which is fine by me. Once I was in possession of the dildo he got on all fours and straight spread eagle like this was NOT his first time with this thiccin. Just kinda wondering, can a totally straight dude be into getting a dildo used on him? Is this even something I should be concerned about?

EDIT: I am 26F he is 27M

EDIT: thank you all for the responses! It honestly wouldn’t matter to me if he was 100% straight or bi or anywhere in between, so I suppose it really doesn’t matter! I enjoyed trying something new and he clearly did too. It makes me happy he is comfortable exploring particular kinks/fantasy’s with me and I now have verified my thought process on liking butt stuff does not indicate sexual orientation and attraction , just what you like do to with your person of choice.

My girlfriend and I (20 M/F) are having sexy time after a great date night.

My    husband, brother, and I were going to a casino for a small getaway    vacation. My mother volunteered to stay at my house and watch my dogs    while we were away for a few days. She would be over in a few hours, so I    was cleaning the house. A package arrived at my door, which ended up    being a fox tail butt plug and ears I purchased a few weeks prior. I    opened it and put it on my bed... My super conservative Church of  Christ   mother comes over to watch the dogs. We are casually talking,  while I   show her things around the house. I walk into the room, and my  dumb ass   totally forgets I have the butt plug on the bed. My mother  quickly  steps  against the wall with her eyes widened. She asks, ""Do I  have to  watch  that too?"", while pointed at the bed. My cheeks turned  red, as I  did not  know what to say! I just asked, ""what?!"" She  replied, the  RACCOON! My  mother legit believes I have a raccoon  hanging out on my  bed. I bust out  in laughter, with her still  mortified of this creature.  I do have a  history of having weird  animals, so this makes sense to me  that she had  that belief. I quickly  grab the butt plug and toss it in  the closet,  while she decided to  now be okay with it and very gently  ""petted it"".  NOW SHE BELIEVES I  COMMITTED SOME HORRIBLE ANIMAL ABUSE. I  tell her not  to worry about  it, and it will be fine. After much  convincing it is  nothing that will  die, we are able to leave. I told my  brother and my  husband on the  way what happened, and we all had a  great laugh.

It   was about a month  later at a restaurant that we told her what it was.  I  am not sure if  she was more upset her daughter is not vanilla, that   tail butt plugs or  a thing, or the fact she petted it.

Now, they're not actual girls all these pictures are drawn. But some of the comments left on them made me very uncomfortable. They were all pretty vulgar. What made it worse is that a good chunk of the people posting these types of things were women. One person's posts he commented on frequently fit the description of the type of girl to a T. Things I do not have nor can ever have despite his best attempts to tell me I fit the description of that type of woman.

The comments were never directed at the account owners and solely on the content of the images. Honestly, I can't understand why it hurt so much. I did confront him and we spoke about it and how it made me feel. He said he wanted to vent that stuff out and he was unaware the account owner was a woman, who fit that description. Just that the type of content got him more attention he wanted on the site. Only not through the content, he told me he would be posting.

I have several issues with this:

1. I told him he was not as forthcoming about what he was posting as he made himself out to be.
   1. From the beginning of creating this account on this new site, he told me the type of content he was going to post. (Not something I asked he was excited about posting and hopefully getting popular on this new site.) Most were supposed to be about writing, as he hoped to join a writer's group and met similar people. He had mentioned looking for NSFW art, we both have been searching for artists to commission. I made my own account, after him telling me about how it worked and how I can share my own work there. I was completely shocked by what I saw written.
2. He told me he was happy he was expressing himself sexually
   1. I thought this had been about our increasing sex life and my push to be more open with speaking that way. I was raised in a VERY restrictive home and religion. He was/is aware of that and how hard it has been for me to open up in that manner. So finding out it had been about writing those types of things on those/her posts really hurt and knocked me on my ass.
   2. This, to me, kind of feels like it contradicts what he says about the comments. They were in his mind nothing comments, just ""throwaways."" That he thought when I see them I would tease him about the stuff he's ""into"".
   3. But that also contradicts that his statement of him just playing a role on that site and it's not him at all. It was all meme-ing to get popular enough.
3. I told him how disrespected I felt and he deflected saying I make him feel disrespected.
   1. His example was while were talking and I check my phone. I can understand how this. I am attached to my bestfriend and we've been having issues lately. Though I don't think the two equate, if anyone can shed a light on this it would be helpful.
   2. I always thought those kinds of things were between us and it felt like he took it outside of the relationship.
4. He claims he didn't read the bio and that the ones he mainly posted on were women
   1. Admittedly if it were guys, yeah I probably wouldn't care as much. But the fact that a good chunk were women and some say so in their bio. He says he didn't read them. I can admit that's a possibility since you can subscribe without seeing the page but I'm having a hard time especially with that one person.
   2. The fact that the girl he mainly posted on fit what they had small chats or he commented on really rubs me the wrong way.
5. The way he represented himself online really grossed me out.
   1. His user name is one he uses for nearly everything he makes. Some variation on it if he can't get the exact one. Even for his professional email.
   2. Even though he wanted to get popular, mainly for his writing, this was the wrong way to do it. That it would bring the wrong type of people to him and seeing how things went I believe it did.

There's more but these and these points seem to be what really gets under my skin.

To his credit, he's since stopped. He's apologized and said after thinking about it while on a long shift at work that he sees how stupid it was of him and that in no way did he think it would have this effect on me.

I'm having trouble dealing with the fact that had I not called him out this would be ongoing. He's left the account up and hasn't been active and the girl he had commented and spoke to more frequently seems to be trying to gain his attention. Now that he's stopped I noticed she's been sharing his older posts and commenting on things she previously ignored. It's not simply that the newsfeed for this site shows things in random order, it continually shows the new things posted and stays in that order so she must go to his page and scroll down to get to his older posts.

I need advice on how to let this go and move on. I feel torn between wanting things to go back to normal and for a bit feeling like they are to being upset and disgusted with him.

Anyways, although I wish I could say that one of my guests found out about the fleshlight instead of what happened, he didn't. He asked me if I had any soap left in the bathroom and I said there's some more in the kitchen and before I proceeded to grab it for him, he mentioned that there's hand sanitizer in the bathroom and asked if he could use it.

About fifteen minutes later he went to wash his hands again for some reason, I just thought he'd spilled some drink onto himself or something but fast forward to today, I went back into the bathroom, needed some soap and looked for the hand sanitizer. I was thinking that he may have accidentally taken it while he was drunk but then I realised that the Fleshwash was not in its usual spot. I've never even had a hand sanitizer in my bathroom in the first place. I sincerely hope his hands are fine.

Background: I am a lesbian teenager, and am in love with a bisexual named Serena. We've been friends for about 2 1/2 years, but things became romantic and sexual in September. I've been also friends with this guy named James for around 6 months, but we've known eachother for a while. James and Serena have been friends for about 4 years on and off They dated for like a month about 3 years ago. They only had phone s■x once according to Serena.

   Serena and I started hanging out and the first time, things got heated and we had s■x.  I found out she had a long distance boyfriend a week after. They dated for a while, and I found out he was very toxic. He would yell at her, threaten to harm himself if she left him, &amp; once tried to kms on facetime and forced her to watch. On Halloween everyone urged her to dump him, but she didn't; but she wanted things between us to continue. It wasn't the best idea, but I didn't object &amp; we had s■x that night.

   Guilt hit us both, so we only made out once the next time I came over. The most recent time we cuddled, and I let her know that I still liked her; but didn't want to get in the way of her and her bf. I noticed that she was texting James while I was there.

   Recently, they broke up bc he cheated on her with 2 people &amp; sent pics to about 30. I comforted her, and we began exchanging I love you's, flirting over text, and talking about some nsfw things we wanted to do. We didn't talk this weekend bc she was busy hanging out with friends, but I talked to her today and things seem normal for the most part.

   I got a message from James yesterday saying he was planning on asking her out, and said it again today. He's too nervous to, and isn't 100% sure if he is. I didn't know they were still talking, but I am a little hurt because James knows about how I feel about Serena. Maybe he isn't aware it is still going on though. Serena and I are gonna hang out this weekend, and I'm considering asking her out... I really love her, and can't imagine myself with anyone else.

Should I ask her out? And how do I talk to James about it? (sorry this is so long, i tried to summarize)

TL;DR.  My crush cheated on her bf with me, they broke up, and now my friend wants to ask her out. I gotta make a decision asap, what should I do?

*Edit:* I almost asked her out, and backed out last second because I got a weird vibe. Mentioned it to her the next day, and she said she would've said no. It hurt, but I got over it.

Her and James were flirting when we all hung out, and then he asked her out last week. She said no to him too-

I've been with my partner (let's call him Drew) for nearly 5 years now. It's by far the longest relationship I've ever been in, I love him deeply and we have seriously talked about marriage and kids.

We have very different sex drives. I'm satisfied with once a week, he has a much higher libido. About a year into our relationship we decided to try an open relationship so that he could find more physical fulfillment. I was fine with it because I want him to be happy and because the terms were equal (I'm allowed to do anything he is). We set down a list of ground rules, including no exes, keep taking PREP, a full STD screen every 3 months, and - most importantly, to me - SAFE SEX. We have unprotected sex together, so it was important to me that he either used a condom with other people, or used a condom with me.

About a year and a half ago, we were on a Labor Day trip to the beach. I was using Drew's phone for something else and accidentally discovered he had a secret twitter account where he would meet and hook up with men (so far nothing wrong with that), but then also film himself having sex with them (getting weirder, especially given he has a high profile public-facing career) and the kicker......almost always without using a condom (there were consistent explicit references to barebacking). I was obviously completely torn up and broke up with him that day. He was distraught- I've always been his rock and he talks consistently about how he ""needs"" me, and I worried that if I stayed broken up with him he would spiral. I also think I let the initial sad &amp; lonely phase of the breakup get to me, so I agreed to get back together a few weeks later. I was living in another city for grad school at the time, so we were doing open long distance. Looking back I'm able to see more clearly that I was manipulated into getting back together with him. (Joke was on me, too - I immediately, like *immediately* caught crabs the nanosecond we were back together. He claims he never had them, but I  had not had sex with anyone but him within 6 months of catching them, so......)

I graduated school last spring and moved back to the city where we met to live with him because it was pretty much my only option during the pandemic. Things are for the most part good - we don't fight often, we do have pretty compatible personalities and our sex life had been improving. He supported me through a rough patch with my job and I helped him through studying for and passing the bar exam in the fall. He's planning on joining the military (reserves) this year so I've also been helping him prepare for that major life transition.

About a month ago we had a fight about something stupid, I don't even remember what. When Drew's upset at me he often gives me the silent treatment to ""teach me a lesson"" (his words). We fought about something in the afternoon, he left our apartment soon after, and didn't come back the entire night. At first I thought he was at work, then I thought he was at the gym, then I thought he was at a bar with friends. I tried texting him to ask if he was OK but got no response. I went to bed worrying about him, and in the morning woke up to a text where he explained he decided to go on a last-minute cabin trip with friends, and essentially said ""why are you freaking out at me, I'll be home soon."" When he came home he acted like what he did was completely normal. I eventually dropped it because he refused to acknowledge that he had done anything wrong.

Yesterday he came in from work and told me, very contritely, that he received news from his doctor that he tested positive for chlamydia, and that he thinks he contracted it on the cabin trip....because he had unprotected sex with some guy.

I think in the moment I knew I should've been furious, but somehow I didn't even have the energy to be. I just told him I would get tested and that was that. Even after I spent a few hours processing, I had some sterner words for him about repeatedly violating the terms of our open relationship. He claims not to remember having laid down ground rules about safer sex (even though there's a document saved on my computer, dated from nearly two years ago, in which we wrote down our rules). He also, when I was talking to him, acted really downcast (unable to maintain eye contact, agreeing to everything I said) because he is admittedly really bad at hearing harsh truths about himself. So eventually after a few minutes of me sternly reiterating my boundaries I let it go. I'm just completely numb and don't even know how to be mad or upset. I actually ended up cooking him dinner and giving him a foot rub as he asked because he had been standing all day at work.

It hit me in a really desperate wave last night that I might be being abused, but I also have a lot of confusion and shame around using that word, because I have a strong self-concept and feel like ""oh, I'm a physically and mentally strong adult, surely \*I\* could never be abused,"" even though I know that's naive and stupid. Right now I'm lying in bed, completely devoid of emotion and confused and totally unsure of what to do next. Every time I think I want to leave him, I think about all the great parts of our 5-year relationship and how difficult it would be to sever that for good, thus giving up on a lifetime we've planned together. He's leaving for basic training in 4 weeks and he's already in kind of a state about that, so leaving him now would cause him to fall apart at a really critical moment.

Then there's the fact that, even despite what he's done to me, I still love him. I can't hate him because I have a full understanding of his personhood, his flaws and his past traumas, and the psychology behind why he acts the way he does. He's not evil, he's just a hurt person, and sometimes that manifests itself in him hurting me. And I feel like I can't punish him for that.

I'm just deeply confused and would appreciate any insight from anyone who's been through anything similar to this.

**TL;DR-** my boyfriend of 5 years has now repeatedly lied to me about safe sex in our open relationship. I'm completely devoid of emotion about it and can't figure out why that is, or what I should do next - and I feel like there are complicating factors preventing me from just up and leaving.",0,0,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,nsfw,I think I (28M) have been repeatedly lied to by my partner (30M) about our open relationship and I don't know what to do.,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/l22rj2/i_think_i_28m_have_been_repeatedly_lied_to_by_my/,promo_adult_nsfw,9.0

But I want to get this out so that someone else may share what their view on whatever tf is happenning to me is, and because I find this interesting.

I have several personality issues, I'm socially anxious and have undiagnosed ADHD, I'm uncomfortable with social interaction and going outside but I think I'm functional since I hold a job. COVID has been both blessing and curse for me because I no longer have any friends

More background: I have gone several weeks without masturbation or watching porn for sexual release.

Two weeks ago I started having recurrent dreams of sexual assault, I'm always the one doing it and there is no violence. on the first time this happenned I woke up with a strange sense of grief.

I had 4 dreams like this over a week, then another one a week later, and finally it stopped. 

Last weekend I was very let down because I deleted all my friends on discord and channels too. I no longer have friends or anyone to talk to but its ok, I have had worse, I'm trying to change my mindset and stop the self-pity

I couldn't shake the feeling of grief from my head and chest though, and I remember this almost exactly how I feltt during the dream. 

I couldnt relax so I started mindless reddit browsing and saw some meme with a panel of some guro manga I read very long ago. I had always found guro very interesting, the plots these authors come up with are often hillariously disturbing.

This panel in particular was from an author that was one of my ""favorites"". I sorted through my bookmarks and browsed some doujins from this author for an hour or so before going to sleep. I lost myself in the absurdity of the guro and forgot the loneliness

Althought this could be considered porn I do not find it sexually arousing. I went to sleep and ofc I had another dream of sexual assault. Its logical to assume reading gory porn before sleep is going to cause me to dream of such, but this is the first time in months since I looked at it.

Is this a bad thing? I believe in such a thing as synchronicity and i think its interesting that the same feeling I experienced after a dream its the very thing that caused me to have a similar dream several days later

I have no idea what intepretation I can draw from the dreams, they usually dont have anything common with each other except the assault. I have no money for therapy sadly and talking about this to anyone is obv out of the question.

I don't know if this belongs here but let's go. Today I remembered about this time a friend of my mom kissed me and touched me and I just started crying. I got very disturbed and anxious an just locked myself in my room. I felt like I couldn't talk about it to my girlfriend or best friend, but now that I'm feeling better I'd like some advice.

When I was 16 to 17, this woman I'll call E went to spend a few days in my moms house. I had a bit of a crush in her, but I also felt intimidated by her age and because she was a super smart feminist artist. Since she was 20 years older than me and was friends with my mom I thought I would never have a chance. I also had a boyfriend at the time, so I was far of thinking to make any moves or anything.

One night after a presentation of her art, me, her and my mom went to a bar to celebrate. They drank a few beers and she gave a small kiss (my mom was way to drunk to notice). I was shocked. She kissed me again on the walk back home and I said I thought we shouldn't do this because I had a boyfriend. She said it was okay, it was just a kiss, and then proceeded to convince my mom to let us 3 sleep together on the same bed (because it would be too weird if E just said her she would share a bed with me). I didn't opposed. I was feeling a bit weird but a bit aroused to, I don't know how to explain.

So me, E and my mom laid on my mom's bed. E was on the middle, ans she then proceeded to star touching me while talking to my mom about casualities. I didn't opposed to it. I didn't disliked it. But I felt a bit weird too. It was just confusing. I felt a bit obligated to touch her too (I don't bodyshame other women, but I also remember her mom body feeling very weird for my 16yo self) , since she did the same thing with me, and then we went to sleep.

I always used to brag about having seduced a ""MILF"" to my friends, but never thought much about it. I tried to bring it to therapy once, but my thoughts were so confused we were not able to proceed with the analisys.

I just don't know what to think about it. I won't be a hipocryte and just straight up say she's wrong for being a pedophile. I'm no saint, I had a think with a 28yo man at the time (we just gave a few kisses, went to the cinema and had some sexy facetime moments. We never had sex tho). I always felt guilty for cheating on my boyfriend at the time, and I'm afraid my memory is tricking me into thinking this felt that bad at the time. Maybe I'm just trying to vitimize myself to get away with cheating, or maybe I just couldn't handle being with a smart, strong woman.

I remember telling my mom (don't remember telling her in detail) a few years later and she laughed it of, but later said she felt a bit disturbed about it.

Anyway. Theres a lot of frustrations because he thinks I'm low libido. The thing is, I don't think I am. But I try harder and harder to be overtly sexual for him.

I suggested getting help for us and he was hesitant. But I'm out of ideas because currently when I detect he's in the mood, I go off somewhere and turn myself on which sometimes doesn't happen.

I have only one problem, I'm not very physically attracted to her. I've always dated more fit gals, a few dancers, one fitness instructor, a couple other average women but they were on the fitter/thinner side. This woman is actually a competitive power lifter so it's not like she's a slob. Quite the opposite. She's stronger than me, which doesn't bother me at all, I think it's cool actually. She has a nice face, too. Oh, she's much shorter than any woman I've ever dated too. The shortest woman I've ever been with, even all the way back to high school is 5'6"", she's 5'3"". I guess I never thought about it but I'm not attracted to her body type. If you asked me before I would've guessed my libido would allow me to perform no matter who I'm with but I wasn't able to with her, at least I wasn't able to perform PIV when it came time for that. I don't think it's fair to bring up my level of attraction to her physical appearance. 

My question is, do I keep pushing forward and maybe get used to something new or do you think I'm doing her a disservice by pursuing something I'm not sure about?

About 20 minutes ago, I walked into the kitchen to get a bowl of chili for dinner. My younger sister casually mentions that our older brother said something really offensive again. This is a pretty common occurrence, so she basically was laughing about it. I initially didn't want to hear it because i wanted to enjoy my night, but she ended up telling me that he had said ""his past gender dysphoria was partly caused by the women in our household being too strong"". Yep. \*

I half-laughed and proceeded to joke to my sister saying something close to ""he's a grown ass man who can't handle strong women? aww i think he needs to go back to kindergarten cause i don't think he ever matured"". I fully admit I said this in a mocking way and in a bit of a baby voice. My mom who was listening, acted shocked and proceeded to tell me how horrible I was being. Just then, my brother walked in. He had overheard me, and said, ""Why don't you just shut the fuck up?"" At this point, I had two full grown adults yelling at me. I retorted ""I'm the asshole for mocking him? He essentially just said that his perceived mental issues were caused by our confidence. Imagine if I went up to him and said 'Hey, you being confident and strong? Yeah, that makes me feel shitty, so you have to stop.'"" She agreed with me on this, but insisted I was wrong for mocking him. I then said if the roles were reversed, he would have every right to mock me for being an asshole. I walked away, and this is where the fight ended.

So, AITA?

He has never said or displayed anything in the past that backs this claim, but has been repeating it increasingly over the past couple years since becoming outspoken on his opposition to porn and female sexual domination.

I (gay M) was 18 and really horny and I had decided to take nudes of myself to boost my confidence. For some reason I thought my own phone wasn't ""good"" enough to take those pictures so I decided to use the camera my mother had bought a few years back. 

I started to do my thing, took a LOT of really nasty pics of myself and after I'm finished, I transferred them to my laptop using the SD card in the camera. I put the camera back where I took it and went back to finish what I had started.

I forgot about it for a time until one day where my mom came to tell me she's going fishing with her boyfriend and she's taking the camera with her just in case they catch something big. I didn't think much of it until i asked myself something : I transferred the pics to my PC, but did I delete the pics from the camera after I put it back ?

I started panicking and kept asking myself if I deleted those pictures or not. At this point it's too late to call my mom back and ask her the camera for a few minutes so I can check and delete them just in case. I spent the entire day making up the worst scenarios I could think of, completely freaked out about it until my mom and her boyfriend came back from their fishing trip. I stayed in my room for about an hour, terrified to get out and face the possibility of my mom seeing her son's asscheeks spread in front of the family camera and 10~ other nasty pictures of all sorts.

After some time my mom came in my room, talked to me like nothing happened at all so I was completely relieved. I thought : ""Either I DID delete those pics or she did not see them yet"" but I still felt better anyways. After they both went to bed I went and checked the camera and there was no pictures of myself to find.

My relief only lasted for a while because the next day I overheard my mother and her boyfriend talking. All I heard of the discussion was ""You kept those pictures?!"" from my mom's BF. I immediately ran to my room, once again completely panicked. I had not imagined this possibility that my mother could have seen those pictures and deleted them without talking about it with me and pretended that nothing happened.

We're a few years later and i moved out of my mom's house and I'm still not sure I deleted those pictures. And I'm still wondering if they were talking about those pictures or not. My mom never brought it up if she saw them and I'm scared to ask her about it out of embarrassment.

A lot of them are small non issues, but the bigger ones are starting to get on my nerves, and i feel like without some drastic change, they will eventually destroy the relationship.

The first insecurity is with the dog. We have a small sheperd dog, very cute one. She doesn't really know how to give it affection, but she's also super sexual with it. Like she'll touch the dog's private parts and simulate jacking it off, its super weird and disturbing. But beyond that, she regularly yells at the dog, neglects to walk it, does the absolute bare minimum by feeding it in the morning and that's pretty much it. On the other hand she despises and complains incessantly that said dog is more attached to me than her. Except, i have no way of fixing this problem, i wouldnt even know how anymore, due to the complete apathy from her side.

The second issue i have is how she needs to linger and spy on everything i do. If i take my phone out or put it away too fast, that's a problem. If i take a nap with the lights off, that's also a problem. Based off her own testimony we are completely incompatible and yet we're still dating? It seems clear that she definitely does not fucking trust me, so i have no idea why she lingers around. I mean by her own admission, she hates my personality, hates my bubbliness, hates that i talk to people, despises that i have my own hobbies, hates that i walk the dog without her (except she never comes when offered), hates that i work out by myself (have had tantrums thrown at me for working out at home. She was actually sobbing at the fact i decided i want to get fit?), has had multiple meltdowns over me trying to talk to my parents or maintaining friendships, 

And the problem really, is that what else am i gonna have to give up? This person only really seems to be happy when im miserable. If i show an inkling of happiness, this person goes into complete nag mode, or decides to either insult me, denigrade me, or who the hell knows until im miserable again.

This happened when my wife and I took our 2 boys on a little vacation in December 2017. We rented a 21' camper trailer and drove up from Florida through the Smokies and up to a campsite in New Jersey. On Christmas we went to New York City and had a relatively good time, despite being Floridians who didn't know how to deal with the cold.

After a couple days in New York, we had a tour of the Capital Building, so we made the decision to leave the camper in our spot at the camp site and drive to DC and back all in the same day- manageable, but a little stressful.

That morning after struggling to get our boys (ages 9mo. and 5 years) and ourselves ready to go, we realized we're kinda cutting it close on time- we have the last tour of the day and we need to book it to get there.

This is where I fucked up- I skipped my morning ""movement"" to make sure we'd leave on time, surely they'd have restrooms I could use somewhere along the way. After stopping to get gas on the way off of the turnpike, I checked the restroom and lo and behold, a line maybe 7 men long... I'd have to wait to take the Browns to the Superbowl until DC...

So after hours of driving, thanks to traffic we just barely made it to DC with what seems like JUST enough time to make it into the tour, and now my stomach went from uncomfortable to sharp cramps and PAIN. I've never had to poop so bad it HURT like this. Now we're trying to find a place to park and I'm getting MAD and my wife is trying to tell me where to go, all places that are either too far from the Capital Building or the lots are full- I tried to take some turns down streets near the building only to get turned around by Capital Police.

All the while I'm really yelling at my wife and being mean, she's laughing hysterically at me (letting my mean comments go because she knows my situation, bless her heart). I'm telling her I'm gonna just ditch the car on the side of the road for her to deal with while I run into the nearest building, but decide against it. Finally we realize we can park in congressional parking lot because there's no business being conducted that day.

As we're putting the boys' layers on, she informs me, ""The website said no strollers, by the way, we have to carry (our younger son) and carry only what we need... Great. Not only am I pinching my balloon knot as hard as I can to keep my brownie mix while struggling with winter layers on me and the boys that are completely foreign to a Floridian, now I have to physically exert myself more to carry him! And guess what, my puffer jacket is as slick as teflon! If I put him on my hip, he slides RIGHT OFF! Now it's 100% arm strength as we dash what seems like a mile to the entrance on the OTHER side of the building, and what-do-you-know? Strollers... Strollers everywhere. FFS, can this be any worse?

I'm about to explode, my leather cheerio is being subjected to pressures rivaled only by the eruption of Vesuvius. We inquire about the tour and they tell us ""you're probably too late, but there's the line"" Gesturing towards the 60 people with strollers and casual attitudes that only serves to infuriate me more. While in line, my wife mentions that she forgot her ID... Surely you can't get into THE Capital Building without and ID. I was just about to say ""FUCK IT"" and run off to a shitter somewhere, when the line starts to move and figure we might make it.

Finally make it inside and it is TOASTY - but now we have to go through security - we need to remove all of our jackets and everything, place it on the x-ray conveyor and walk through with our boys. OK, easy enough, right? Well not for someone who's not used to winter clothes, and DOESN'T HAVE A STROLLER. So now I'm walking through the scanner holding my youngest and my pants are falling down because I have no belt, and we're onto the other side, thankfully they didn't ask for IDs and we've seemingly made it. Now we're inside, but we have a whole HEAP of coats and jackets that its far too warm to put back on... so what do we do?

My wife came up with the good idea to just stuff it all into the baby's winter-suit (I forget the proper name) and that actually works, albeit it now looks like we have 3 children. Mind you, my stink-wrinkles are still under siege - but we're in, and we're coming up with solutions. The tour begins, I'm carrying our baby boy, and swinging around what LOOKS like another infant carelessly under my arm, and sweating.. Sweating profusely. Sweating so much that it's running down the crack of my ass and now I'm thinking there's a 50/50 chance I already lost- that my sphincter gave way to a mudslide. I'm so nervous that I try REALLY hard not to stand in front of anybody, lest they catch a whiff. Levels of uncomfortable I never imagined were possible.

The tour heads into a theater where they play a short movie - I couldn't tell you what it was about - ""THANK GOD"" I thought, SOME sort of reprieve from the misery that is my life right now - I can sit down!! - and maybe smell if something has in fact gone awry, cause up til now I'm just relying on my wife to tell me if she smells anything, but she's been laughing at me so hard I don't know if she even know's whats happening anymore.

Only our youngest didn't like the movie apparently, because as I sat down he began to cry... and cry loudly... Okay, I can do this.. just get up.. just walk around, he'll be okay and I can go sit down again... Up and down the whole showing, and my wife has tears in her eyes at this point... She's laughing so hard that she'd probably go weak at the knees if she tried to hold our boy, so I continue suck it up.

After what seemed like a showing of the Titanic, the tour continues and we're again, only now since we were at the back of the theater, we're at the front of the line, and I'm just trying to gauge people's reactions near me. Surely if they smelled my shit, they'd make some sort of sour face, yeah? As we're walking, I finally feel some sort of relief, like my body decided to give me a break and my colon just ""sucked it up"" for a bit, so despite my sweaty ass-crack, life is somewhat bearable, and I finally realize, hey, this is kinda cool, I'm in a really historic building here! Look at the art and stuff!

Maybe 15 min into the tour though, our youngest begins to cry and now he just hasn't stopped... and our 5 year old is getting a little impatient as he doesn't think a whole lot of what's going on as little kids tend to do... so we decide to finally just break it off and leave - only we're in the middle of the Capital Building and we have no idea where to go - we're going up and down stairs and getting turned around by velvet ropes and I'm asking every staffer I see where the nearest restroom is -

Finally we make it to the toilets and I hand off the baby and dart inside. It's a pretty full house in there, but there's an empty stall - I dart in and as I'm pulling my jeans, my thermals, and my underwear down, I feel it coming. No sooner do my cheeks hit the seat that the Hershey Highway unleashes Hell - Unashamedly disgusting every other man in that bathroom, and probably anyone within earshot in the hallway. Normally I'd courtesy flush, but it's all happening so fast that the thought totally escapes me. I deposit so much crude oil that there's a mountain in the toilet that it brings up feelings of nostalgia - to the first time I saw Jurassic Park when Laura Dern was elbow-deep in it.

There's so much relief I feel like I'm having a moment of clarity and realize how mean I'd been to my wife and I legit felt really bad about it. After taking a picture, then flushing and washing up and walking out as fast as possible (I'm sure it clogged) I walk out and apologize to my wife. She was super understanding and honestly found it funny as hell, so no harm done.

This became known as **The Crapital Hill incident**, and we still have a big chuckle about it from time-to-time.

I was a [20M] and was experimenting with ""butt stuff"", I knew I wasn't bi or gay but the thought of putting something up their seemed, well... pleasurable. I didn't  if I'd like it or not and didn't have the confidence to get an actual sex toy for this. So, I decided to use a vape bottle. It was probably 4½ inches and an inch in diameter, seemed good for a first try. Like a dumb ass I thought just wiping it off with a towel was good enough, no soap, no real washing. Fast forward a week and half; urinating burned like hell and my anus burned just ass much. I denied the fact I had given myself some sort of infection by shoving a vape bottle up my ass, so I tried to ignore it. A couple days later, I'm peeing straight blood and the pain from urinating was excruciating. So, I finally decided to go the doctor. I went to an urgent care center and explained the symptoms without telling the doctor why this could've happened because shoving a vape bottle up your ass isn't something your trying to tell ANYONE. UTIs are very rare in men and gonorrhea has similar symptoms and is more likely in males than a male having a UTI. This also could've been a prostate infection which could've lead to a UTI. The doctor then started to argue that it was probably gonorrhea because of what I stated before. I assured her it wasn't because I wasn't sexually active for about a year. This persisted and the doctor started to get irritated, and finally I gave it to her straight ""I shoved a vape bottle up my ass to see if it would feel good, and I did not properly wash it"". Myself and the doctor went silent, the embarrassment I felt was immeasurable and the doctor was probably trying to hold in uncontrollable laughter. I ended up getting antibiotics, and in a few days everything was fixed. 

TL;DR: I shoved a vape bottle up my ass that I didn't wash properly. Got a raging UTI not wanting to go to the doctor out of embarrassment. Argued with the doctor it wasn't gonorrhea because I avoided what could've caused it.

It was before brunch and she was wasted. I could hear her slurring.

""OP, I need you to call your father for me. Right. Now.""

""Mom, that's a boundary. I can't talk to dad for you. You need to call him yourself.""

""OP, I need your help. Call your father right fucking now!""

""Mom I can't! That's not fair. We've talked about this.""

""How dare you you ungrateful fucking-""

I hung up on her.

And then the text messages started rolling in.

""Tell your brother and sister I love them, and that I'm sorry."" ""You never gave a shit about me.""

When I tried to tell her that my father was on a plane, even though that broke the boundary, she didn't believe me. ""Wrong answer,"" she said.

Then no answer. Then ten minutes. ""Mom?"" Twenty minutes.

Silence.

I couldn't tell if she was being abusive, or if she was going to end her life. So I got on the phone with the suicide hotline. My brother left his house and immediately started driving to her, though he lives six hours from my mom. I live across the country and am injured, so I can't travel without special assistance.

Some context before I continue:

My parents were at the very end of a horrible divorce. A five year long separation, only in the last year did the paperwork finally come out, after my mother threatened to take her life the first time. COVID had only been going on for a month but the isolation destroyed her. That time my brother drove 6 hours to see her and stayed with her for a month and a half until she seemed stable. Got her on medication. Regular talk therapy over the phone. At the time she wasn't eating. She wouldn't speak of her significant symptoms, only now does it seem like she exhibits symptoms of Schizophrenia with episodes of mania and hysteria. My brother told me that as he'd try to calm her, she'd scream ""he's choking me, he's choking me"" over and over again. But she had no marks, no bruises, she'd just start manically hallucinating. And then my brother nursed her back to health. Healthy diet, exercise, and she was almost back to normal.

I've had a lot of trouble setting clear boundaries with my mother. On top of all of these symptoms she's a cynical narcissist, and if you don't do things for her she will berate you. This was regular behavior, it wasn't just a boy who cried wolf situation. She became regularly abusive. I won't repeat some of the things she has told me in the past because I'm not looking to, even anonymously, bring those words to a place that will outlive her.

There was a time she was a kind, powerful mother. One without episodes of mania and hysteria. She used to be gritting but only in a calculated way to get what she wanted. She's a lot of the reason I'm as strong as I am today.

But since the divorce, she's become a completely different person. She blames me for the divorce, because I told my parents I wanted them both to be happy, and that's all I cared about. It's getting harder and harder to hold on to the memory of my once bright, strong mother.

Every time she would call me would end in her crying hysterically on the phone for the past five years, lashing out at me for hours. My girlfriend finally told me to hang up on her when she got to be at her worst. I started never taking calls from my mom after 6, because that's when she'd start drinking. But the drinking began to start earlier, and earlier, and earlier.

Last year I snapped and yelled back at my mother. I told her that the last five years have been horrible, and I just want to have one normal conversation with my mother where she's not making up stories about what a horrible man my father is. Because after all these years I know he never laid a finger on her in that way. She was abused in a relationship in her teens and as a child and that trauma has never left her. My father is one of the nicest, most caring people I've ever met, and knowing the kind of person he is and has always shown herself to be, while watching her blame the same exact trauma from those earlier times in her life on my father instead of seeking therapy is what I think destroyed my parent's relationship and what ultimately destroyed my relationship with her.

I've spent FIVE YEARS trying to get her to get regular therapy and to talk honestly with a psychiatrist. She won't do it consistently and there's no way for my brother or I to legally tell a therapist that she has manic episodes and begins to hallucinate for her. So, that's my relationship with my mother right now.

Continuing on:

The officer called me. He was the same officer from the last time. But the last time he just sat down with her and she calmed down. She didn't have anything to harm herself with. This time? She had a bottle in her and, her sleeping pills spilled out on her bedside, and not that it would've hurt her but she had clearly been smoking weed so the mix is probably not great.

He let me know that she was talking to the hotline and that's why he was there, and the hotline connected both me and my mom to the same officer. He told me she was ""very drunk"" but had no real signs that she would hurt herself. That she was saying ""all the right things"" and ""knew what not to say.""

He asked me if anyone had been stalking her, because she kept repeating ""he's choking me, he's choking me!"" over and over, but she didn't have any visible bruising around her neck or body. When he told me that, I knew I had to get her help.

So I sent him the texts showing her saying her goodbyes and they took her to the hospital. First to chem to make sure she hadn't abused narcotics and then to the mental health facility. I called the hospital and they told me she was safe, but I couldn't talk to her because she hadn't consented to that.

My brother arrived at her apartment. He drove the same six hours he did last time. Only this time to an empty, messy apartment.

An hour after he got there, he received a call from my mom who called the home phone to her place. Apparently, she couldn't remember any of our phone numbers. Even though they're all only a digit off from hers.

Here's where the story gets weird: she said that in the mental health lobby, a crazy woman *punched her in the face* and now she needs medical attention. My brother told me that he was going to pull her out of there if it was true. I didn't believe her, but then the police called and said indeed, yeah, crazy lady did in fact punch her and my mom was going to seek damages. Before she'd go, because she was still under the influence, the hospital made her stay until they could run a diagnostic in the morning but a nurse would stay with her for the night to make sure she was actually safe.

...

This morning my brother picked her up with her black eye, got her signed up again for talk therapy over the internet, and it's feeling like the cycle is ready to repeat itself again. He told me ""she's going to use this to gaslight us for a long time."" I just feel awful. I didn't send her to get assaulted, I sent her to what I thought would be professional, medical help in a safe place, so she wouldn't die. Help that she herself has refused to get for years.

I don't know what to do. I feel like so betrayed and I feel so guilty. I just want my mother to be happy, and it seems like she's only content when she tears everyone down with her. And it seems like the only medical help she's ever going to receive is at the bottom of the bottle, worst case scenarios like the awful treatment she received at that hospital. So now I feel like if I call again, and I need an officer's help, they're going to take her to the loony bin. So I don't have a way to ""save"" my mother if she does call for help.

I've been feeling like it might be best to stop answering her calls from now on, never call her again. Just let things be what they will be. I've spent years trying to rebuild a relationship that she has an active interest in dismantling. It's like I'm building a bridge from one side of a cliff and when I finally manage to get to the other side she lays down some dynamite. But then I feel like a terrible son.

It’s the magical acronym that I teach all my young mathematicians to help them remember the order of operations (parenthesis, exponents, multiplication...). 

PEMDAS is also commonly associated with the phrase: “Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally”. This also helps my students remember said order.

Well this year I decided we were going to do something different. Instead of saying “Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally”, I challenged my students to come up with their own phrase because not many people actually have an Aunt Sally and it’s not relatable. I want the kids to own it and make it relatable to them, so they remember it during a test. 

Amongst all the usual childish submissions I get for activities like this, one stood out: Please Eat My Delicious Asshole Salad. 

I was shook. For a second I froze up, but then immediately took his paper, put it on my desk and gave this student the dreaded “come see me after class”.

Class ends, the student approaches my desk and I do my best to glare deep into his eyes to emphasize how serious I am taking this matter. I start to ask him why he wrote what he wrote, why he thought it was funny, where he learned this phrase and so on. He stares back at me confused, but confident in saying, “I don’t see what is so wrong with what I wrote...” 

I explain to him that not only do we NOT use the word asshole, we DEFINITELY don’t use phrases of a sexual nature such as “eating asshole” in my classroom. I tell him that this won’t be tolerated and that he is going to see the principal right now. 

Even more confused, my student looks at his paper and says “but that doesn’t say asshole....”

I’m mortified, I’m terrified, I’m embarrassed, I’m confused. I start to backpedal and ask him what he wrote. 

He says, “I’m sorry my handwriting is really bad, but I wrote: Please Eat My Delicious Apple Salad. I didn’t write the A word. I wrote Apple”

And that is how I accused my student of referencing ass eating during a math assignment. His handwriting was so shit that I thought Apple said Asshole.

TLDR:

First of all, sorry for my weird English, I’m typing this from my phone and feeling very overwhelmed right now. 

My boyfriend of 6 years picked me up tonight at my house because we were planning to go to a motel to have some fun. This is not the first time we do this, however, we’ve never had sex because I want to wait until marriage (please don’t judge) but we do have oral sex and pretty much do anything except penetration. 

He has told me on many occasion in the past that he would love to put a sleep mask on me before going down on me, it was like his fantasy. Today while getting ready I remembered that I had one face mask that belongs to my mom but never wore it, so I took it with me.

Fast forward when we arrived at the motel, we were feeling very in the mood and we started doing our stuff. I told him I brought the face mask and he was super excited to put it on me. He did it and then he started going down on me and stuff but then he wanted me to suck his dick while still wearing it, I feel in some moments he is also covering my eyes with his hand as well. He is basically sitting on top of me while I suck him off while wearing the face mask. 

Suddenly, I try to reach out to touch his chest and my hand bumps against something that felt like hard and plastic, I asked him if he has something in his hand, to which he answers no. However I was pretty sure something was going on so I asked him if he was recording me. He says no again. However I keep insisting until he finally said yes, and pulls out his phone from underneath a pillow.

I immediately started freaking out and asked him why was he recording me to which he answered he just wanted to have that video so he could jerk off to it. I told him it was completely wrong because he was recording me without my consent and that I felt very disrespected. And that he knew what we has doing was wrong because he was hiding it from me.

I was so pissed I even slapped him once,and I i immediately asked him to take me home so he did. We didn’t speak the whole ride and I just got off and left.

Although I've basically been an ashiest all of my life, when I was younger I was more curious about the idea of religion. My brother and I use to attend this Christian youth club with our friend who's family were quite religious. It was about once a week and we'd meet up in church and there would be discussion and reading of the bible but also fun stuff like food, games and socialising with friends that made the whole thing more appealing.

One evening, instead of going to the church we instead went to one of our supervisors house. There were only about 6 of us in her relatively small flat. Things moved on as usual, just general light chat and fun. Then the things got a bit more serious. The woman who's house we were at started to recall on her memories as a teen, and started telling us how she got into religion in the first place. Her story was a difficult one, explaining how she got into hard drugs and prostituting herself to make money in order to keep up with her habits and as you can imagine the room is deadly silent, so you know... the perfect time to let some gas out...

I was sat on the floor with on of my knees pointing upwards which in retrospect didn't help me at all. Nevertheless I let one rip and it was only slightly audible but enough for my brother and our friend to hear it... At this point I'm desperately trying not to laugh but the harder I try the more difficult it seems to get and then my brother and our friend begin to laugh silently with our bodies shaking uncontrollably from our attempts at holding in our laughter and at this point the poor woman is crying from telling us her story/history! What a mess that was and to this day I'm surprised that no one made a comment about our giggling, maybe they heard or smelled my fart, or just respected that we were quite young. I really hope they did hear the fart because I think the alternative thought is much worse!

Thank God for Reddit where we can write our most shameful situations and seek anonymous advice. I just had a hysterical crying session over my dad, its happened many times but lately situations have been building yet again and I just snapped tonight. Let me give you some history and background:

My parents divorced when I Was 5. I don't remember much, he cheated on my mom, spoke disrespectfully about her and her side of the family for years, tried to get out of paying child support etc. constantly went on about that he had to pay her, I was always in the middle. I remember being a kid and being confused but somehow knowing inside that he wasn't a nice person, so different from my mom, grandparents, aunts uncles my friends families. Don't get me wrong I had a great childhood, thankfully because he moved out when I was five and I cant imagine how messed up I would be if I had to be raised by him. He always had money, so he would buy me things but then tell me I never appreciated anything, was a spoiled brat, as I got older the insults turned to idiot etc. (note: I don't believe I was spoiled. I was a hard working kid with good friends who had lots of goals and productive activities. I remember him taking the wedding picture of my mom and him and smashing it when I was five and yelling at her. I remember her crying on the couch and I went and put my arm around her. I think something in that moment started to wire my brain slightly, you cant unsee that. I remember him getting very angry throughout my childhood and being confused at what the big deal was. I remember my dog ran away and when he got her back I watched and screamed out the window while he kicked her hard in the side.

When I was twelve, he whipped me with a belt that had a metal tip. I remember his fiancé was in the vehicle, and he dropped her off at my grandparents house because she said she didn't want to see that. Screamed at me to pull my pants down while he whipped my bare ass. It was the most fucking shameful thing ever. Throughout high school the yelling and aggressive behaviours continue and constantly being told I appreciate nothing, I used to drive my car onto gravel roads and sob hysterically and something in me just kind of clicked in, I would tell myself no man is EVER going to treat me like a useless piece of shit. I got really motivated, made a career choice at a young age and started busting my ass to get accepted into a good university. I did, and I did very well. Got excellent marks, started to feel excited to be an adult with my own money, never to be told how I appreciate nothing. 

One time in university I had borrowed his wife snowsuit, and it was packed away in a bag in my hometown at my moms. I couldn't remember where it was and when my mom looked for it she didn't see it because it was in a bag. He screamed at me so loud on the phone I had to run upstairs out of total humiliation of my roommates hearing, put me down how my ""minimum wage job"" could never pay for something like that. I have no respect for anybody because I lose their things, on and on and on. I got married young, and I guess thats when things sort of got better for years. I had a career, a husband, my own life and money and I had moved ten hours away. He still was very much the same person but there was nothing to really smack me in the face with anymore or comment on. For the most part I just sort of forgot this shit, not forgot but I buried it away because I had a great life and you know, fuck it right? I am not my dad, I am my own person who is much more kind and compassionate and good then this. 

Fastforwarding to these days, I am divorced now, still secure job and good life situation but am now looking at buying/upgrading to a new home and made the mistake of asking for some advice. Over the past month because we don't agree on certain things, (he has basically told me he forbids me to have a pet, I said im 34 years old and am paying the mortgage I definitely can have a pet) he then says I just want to argue, I do not listen to him, goes on and on and on, yells if I try to correct something. I will admit that I do interrupt at times because he will literally go on a twenty minute yelling spiel, and by the time hes done if I want to comment on something he said earlier, he will brush t off saying grow up, move on. I have an aunt (moms sister) who is very mentally ill and he constantly makes jabs at me saying I am ""just like her"". He also taunted me recently by saying he knew the reason my ex husband left me, and if I could tell him first why he left me (years ago....) then he'd tell me if I were right or not. I said its absolutely none of your business and I have also moved on. Oh, but he used the respectful term ""dumped"" to describe my life biggest trauma..... anyway im still friendly with my ex so I phone him and say look my dads being an asshole again did you say anything to him back then? My ex husband was confused and like wtf not at all I would never tell him anything. Totally trust my ex on that.

I am looking at properties with a Realtor tomorrow and he lives 8 hours away, tonight he gets saying he plans to come out to look with me. First of all I really need to just do this alone. Its literally something I need to do alone. I cant even totally explain why, thats just what I want. I got defensive about that and he freaked out saying how I have no respect for him because I said I don't want to be swayed or influenced by anybody else I really have to feel what I want by myself completely. He totally took offence to that. I also let him know someone I work with may have C-19 and if I find out they do I will be in isolation and cant have company anyways, and if they don't, I have a friend who has been suicidal and would like to be able to maybe stay over at her place with her as im very worried. His words were ""how was I supposed to know you had a friend whose gonna go knock herself"" and I just fucking lost it. fucking LOST it. I said I am hanging up right now you are unbelievable goodbye. Also I was driving and had a ways to go on the freeway and just felt that rage and hurt and disgust and anger and angst building up like he always makes me feel. then he texts over and over and over again how I need to grow up, hes so ashamed and humiliated how I have no respect for him, how he would never have treated his dad this way (because my grandpa was a lovely person????). Then he texts ""call me"" (thats another thing, if I don't call him the second he says that, because hey I don't have a full-time job, or a commute, or plans, or groceries, or ANYTHING ELSE going on in my 34 year old haven't-lived-at home- in a million years life, he snaps. So I phone, and he goes on and on and on about my comment about not wanting to be swayed by him to buy what he likes, for a property. I get that I shouldn't have said that, but I said dad, you are taking that one thing like really hard and I didn't intend for it to be that way. I also said how dare you have used the term ""knock herself"" about my friend who is feeling suicidal who has two young kids and is a single mom. I said could you look her 4 year old in the eye and say something like that? I told him he has no compassion or empathy and its unbelievably hurtful. For the past two hours and literally as I type this he is dismissing all of this and just saying over and over how much I hate him, how hes so ashamed, how I have no respect. he questioned on the second call tonight ""why im like this"" so I said you know, my whole life I felt like I had to constantly defend myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I brought up how one time he screamed at the top of his lungs at me when I was 17 or so, because my mom was working, and my cat needed emergency surgery. I had to take him to the vet and said I may have to miss a dinner with him and my grandparents. He absolutely freaked out at me and screamed how selfish and disrespectful I was. I also brought up the beating at age 12, and how he threatened to smash my car with a baseball bat two years ago and brought his hand up to my face to hit me and got RIGHT in my face. 32 at the time, I said ""you lay one fucking hand on me and you will never see me again"" then that turns into me not having respect for him. He is literally texting me that we should not have a relationship anymore because I have no respect.

my friend had a relationship with a guy who was just objectively shitty. A selection of things he did:

* stealthed her pretty much every time they had sex (promising he wouldn't do it ever again after each time)
* forced himself on her a few times; told her she was boring if she wouldn't let him do XY to him
* constantly put her down for being not as intelligent as him because her job is less prestigious than his
* whenever they met up with female friends of him, he kept telling her how sexy he finds them and how he wished he could fuck them if it wasn't for her
* made her buy him all of his booze (he's an alcoholic and pretty broke) - she's spent hundreds of dollars on him in the first two months they were dating alone
* threatened to break up whenever she would make the most miniscule request (like, ""could you wash your own clothes when you're staying at my place?"")

Well, he's broken up with her around a year ago to go back to his home country and she's still heartbroken. She's been studying his language and her biggest dream is to move to his country so they can be together. Almost every conversation we have inevitably turns to how much she misses him, how great he was in other aspects, how he was the best boyfriend she's ever had yadayadayada. 

I know I sound dismissive but I'm really exhausted. I've told her so many iterations of ""you can do better, this guy was shitty"", tried the gentle route and the tough-love-route. It's like she's completely removed herself from reality. In all fairness, she did try therapy like I suggested but that didn't help. The only other person she talks to about this is her mum, and her advice is more in the vein of ""well that's just how guys are, you should apologize"". 

This is why it feels irresponsible for me to just tell her I've had enough of her swooning over this shitpile of a man. I care about her and it feels wrong to leave her alone in this mental mess.

I (23F) was recently diagnosed with panic disorder. For those that are not familiar, I get panic attacks often and the thought of getting a panic attack triggers me into an attack. A literal circle.

My psychiatrist prescribed me Xanax to take for a short amount of time because I scratch myself till I create wounds that look like burn scars. My mother came with me to the appointment but waited outside, I don't have a license so she brought me. 

When she saw the prescription, she lost her mind. Told me to never take benzodiazepines, they were evil, I would be addicted etc. Which I think are normal thoughts since they can be very addictive. 

I went to my doctor again and he told me to take them just before the panic attacks at least to calm me down. I was disruptive to myself. I decided to not tell my mom that I had purchased and had been using it. 

She somehow learnt about the purchase by the insurance company's letters. She was really mad. She told me that I was going to end up homeless addicted, without any money. 

I also got mad at her for invading my privacy but she didn't listen to me. After 2 hours of screaming, I told her that I would take her off my personal insurance and she could use her public insurance if she wants to.

Hours into the drive and at this point I'm so turned on that maybe I'm not thinking straight. I'm sending him paragraphs of lyrics from the songs I'm listening to, and how bad I want to fuck him.
""No one ever gets as deep inside you, as I do
Our love is a bed of nails
Love hurts good on a bed of nails
I'll lay you down and when all else fails
I'll drive you like a hammer on a bed of nails."" 

But all caps. Because I'm intense.. and he didn't reply, I thought that was very unlike him. I had service still, so maybe he thought that was too much, or maybe he doesn't dig Alice Cooper like I do? 

Turns out, he does like Alice Cooper. Unfortunately, he wasn't the one I sent those multiple paragraphs to, I accidentally sent it to my older brother.

&amp;#x200B;

So I hop under the shower with a bottle of vinegar. Then before I reach for my shampoo, I realise it's also time to do my normal maintenance on my *other* hair - that Down Under - so first I grab the razor and shave my pubes.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, after washing my (head) hair, as normally, with shampoo, I pour the vinegar over my head/hair, let it soak in a little, then rinse it out.

&amp;#x200B;

I realise my mistake when the vinegar hits my freshly-shaven pubic area, which is ON FIRE now (no not in a good way; I mean literally and in a very painful way).

&amp;#x200B;

Luckily, it rinses away quickly, but I'll never shave anywhere on my body on the same day I use vinegar on my body again.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. The vinegar did seem to work well on my hair, which feels all fresh (I rinsed the vinegar out well of course so my hair wouldn't smell bad) and shiny, but I still have the dandruff. I'll have to try it a bit longer to see if it helps.

We ate and everything was normal.

Went to sleep and woke up today normally. Went to the bathroom to take a shit and noticed there were tiny drops of oil in the toilet just there, floating with my shit, it was a very scary moment and I thought I was very sick. I noticed my underwear was dirty with some kind of oil, as well as my bed sheets.

Did some research and apparently what happened is that dogfish is so freaking oily that your body just cannot process all that oil and just gets rid of it through your ass, where the oil slowly leaks out of you. There is no way for you to notice this is happening, since the oil has the same temperature of your body and apparently your asshole is not tight enough to retain the oil, so it's kinda of an unnoticeable, unretainable diarrhea 

Also, there is nothing you can do to ger rid of it, except waiting...

Thanks in advance to anyone who reads this. 

I feel like I am brimming at the edges with what I am carrying and I feel like I am starving for what I will never have. I can't ever imagine ever feeling any other way. I know that the situation as it stands will never evolve into anything greater, nor diminish into anything less. It's all just going to be fucked forever. It's fucked, it's fucked, it's all fucked up and there's nothing I can do about it. 

I am a pretty regular person. I am 27F and I live in \[redacted first world country\]. I am a postgraduate student. I have lots of good friends and I have had several healthy long-term relationships with other pretty regular people. I like documentaries and video games and going for walks. My day-to-day life is normal. However, I am deeply preoccupied. I spend hours ruminating and feeling, well, feeling lots of feelings but overall feeling miserable. No-one is aware of this preoccupation. I have perfected my skill at hiding it.

When I was sixteen, my uncle sexually assaulted me. It gave me PTSD and 11 years later, I am still in therapy. A lot of people in my life know that I live with PTSD and some of them know that it's because I am a victim of incest. Some of my family even know what happened (aunts, a few cousins, my mother). It has fucked me up (undeniably) but I am able to live with it. I no longer have any contact with him. My hypervigilance, anxiety and intrusive thoughts are all much better than they used to be. I do still get nightmares though. 

However, none of that is the worst part; none of that is what I'm ruminating over every fucking day. 

The worst part, and the part that I would do anything to change, while at the same time somehow also feeling certain that I could not change it if offered the chance, is that I am in love with his son. 

He and his son have always lived in \[redacted bordering/adjacent first world country\]. I have met his son, my cousin, fewer than 15 times in my life. We are close in age, he is a few years older. Since we were children we have been magnetically attracted to each other. We were adolescent the first time we were physically intimate, but even before then, we were inseparable whenever together. It was only when I was 19 and attending a family funeral that one of my aunts made a comment to me: ""You and \[redacted\] are obsessed with each other!"" I don't know if it was just an observation, or a warning. Too late to hide anything better by then, anyway. 

I didn't have a great childhood and I know he didn't, either, and sometimes I wonder if that's what made us the way we always have been; disordered attachment, a coping mechanism, something like that. But other times I wonder if it would have been the same in any lifetime. 

He is compellingly beautiful, inside and out. He is gentle, clever, funny, sweet. We are both musical but I would say that he is gifted. He loves animals and he is good with children. For as long as I have known him, I have felt an irrefutable bond between us. I have never felt so seen or so acknowledged, by a separate human, as I do when he looks at me. 

We are both aware that things have always been this way, and that they very probably always will, and that there's nothing we can do about it. We rarely talk and I have not seen him in person for years now. I think of him every day, but actually speaking to him is too painful a reminder of the life that I will never live. I think it is painful for him, too. I know that his father confessed to him what he had done to me and I know that he has to live with the burden of that knowledge, too. I know that he has always loved me and that he can't tell anyone else, either. 

He has a long-term relationship at the moment, which makes me happy, she seems like a really lovely woman. I have crazy thoughts of going to visit him if I am ever able after this Covid situation is more under control, but at the same time, I don't want to, because I don't want to sabotage his happy normal life. I know that if I saw him, we wouldn't be able to keep ourselves from fucking, and I don't want to be 'the other woman' in any situation, let alone in this morbid scenario. 

Anyway, TL:DR I'm in love with a member of my family, we will never be together, but I feel sad every day and miss him every day (and have for as long as I have been cognizant of any emotion) and I can't stop thinking about having his dick inside me; half the time it's the only thing that gets me off. Sometimes I can go days or weeks or even a month or so without thinking of him but it's like touching a wound, it's compulsive and the more I do it the less I seem able to stop.

I have found myself extremely amused by all of the Ben Shapiro memes that have been going around. I found the interview where he said, in response to Megan Thee Stallion’s song WAP, that his doctor wife told him women didn’t get wet absolutely hilarious. That’s about the extent of knowledge and familiarity I have with him and his viewpoints. 


The other night I met up with a tinder date. Things were going well and we ended up going to bed together. This is NSFW and sorry for the TMI, but he said “you’re so wet” to which my brain, for some reason, decided this sexy moment was the perfect time to crack a joke. “Don’t tell Ben Shapiro” is what it wanted me to say. With all of my might I tried to force this comment down, not wanting to bring up Ben Shapiro during sex for the first time with this guy, and succeeded in not letting it rise to the surface. But my idiot self was so amused by the dumb joke I had made in my head that a felt a laugh bubbling up instead. Now, most men don’t really feel so good when a woman laughs in their face right after they’ve gotten undressed, so I was really trying to divert that laugh in whatever way I could and decided to try and let it out as a seductive sigh. But clearly the raging conflict and suppression I was engaged in caught the attention of my sexual partner, and he stopped and said “what?”


My brain was in such a state of disarray that the seductive sigh came out as I answered his question in the most basic terms possible: “Ben Shapiro,” I moaned. His expression was indescribable. Shock, uncertainty, revulsion, all crossed his face in the same split second. We still did the deed but he didn’t finish lmao.  I feel like even if I tried to explain myself, there’s no fixing it. Haven’t heard from him since. 

TLDR: brain wanted me to make a Ben Shapiro joke during sex, accidentally moaned his name instead

Holy shit this blew up. Just gonna address a couple points 

- this happened mid coitus. After the momentary pause he went back to business. I was kinda frozen up by what occurred and by the time I regained my sense it seemed like I’d be digging my own grave deeper if I brought it back up 

- obviously I know I did pretty much everything wrong I could have done. That’s why it’s in this 
sub and not in r/MyLifeIsAwesome. If I could go back I would change things. Next time I’ll just make the joke lol 

- neither of us has reached out since. I think we’re both happy just pretending it never happened

I know that I have done something wrong and shouldn’t do it ever again. 

Basically I have gone through my boyfriends phone a few times. He knows I’ve done it and we’ve talked about my findings. Every time I do it I get incredibly nervous and feel very guilty. I know I shouldn’t do it. I know it’s wrong but there’s something that makes me keep doing it. Probably because I always find something I don’t like on his phone. 

I think my boyfriend is addicted to porn. There’s always so much porn in his browsing history. So. Much. Porn. And while I truly believe my boyfriend would never cheat on me, somehow him looking at this much porn hurts me... and it feels like cheating? It hurts the same way a cheating partner has hurt me. I don’t know! Logically I know it’s not the same thing and I know I should just get over it but I obsess over it and it’s hard. 

So why do I obsess over it? Why do I continuously look through his phone even though I know I’m going to get hurt? Why do I constantly wonder if he’s doing something to hurt me? Why do I WANT to be right about it? How do I ask him to please stop hurting me?

It makes me want to stop having sex with him but then if I stop having sex with him he’s going to watch even more porn and then I’ll be hurt. It’s gotten to the point where I won’t leave to go to work until I’ve made him reach orgasm simply because I don’t want him to watch porn while I’m away from home for 12 hours.

I enjoy dirty talk while he thinks it’s corny. I’d want to say things to him like “I need your dick so bad” or “I need you to fuck my mouth” (sorry if that’s too graphic) but he thinks it’s so corny and silly. Same thing with dirty talk in the bedroom. 

When we do have sex, it lasts maybe 3 minutes tops, 4 if we’re pushing it. He always apologizes after but doesn’t try to stop (I’ve suggested edging - he says he’ll do it but never does.)

My (16f) boyfriend (17m) has a fairly high libdo and every time we see each other he always tries to initiate things like blowjobs or fingering me. I don’t really have a high libdo and I have also experienced sexual trauma with past people that impacts it too.  

My boyfriend has said before that he sees sexual acts as a way to show love for each other and I view it by something fun I enjoy doing and if I’m in the mood I have no issues with him. But recently if I turn down his sexual advances he gets immensely depressed and has gone from happy and fine to suicidal in three minutes and I spend 20 minutes calming him down. The only case where that hasn’t happened is if I accidentally get triggered and he’s calming me down from past memories and feelings of my own sexual trauma. 

I don’t know if he gets that sad because of how he views sexual things and if I should just do it anyways even if id rather do something else to keep him happy and feeling loved. Mainly because a few months ago when I didn’t want to do that many things his mental health took a deep dive from getting better and doing almost ok to being suicidal every day and making plans to do so. And he’s starting to get better again as my libdo is dipping and I don’t want him to take that dive again because it puts a lot of emotional stress on me and I already have some other emotional stress going on at the moment.

I should also say he has ADHD, depression and anxiety. He knows my views on sexual acts. We’re both in therapy. And sometimes when we’re not together and I’m feeling it we’ll type out sexual fantasies to each other and he thinks because of that he starts to expect those kind of moments so it’s kinda my fault for leading him on. He has also had an ex in the past who broke it off shortly after suggesting they stop sexual acts.

What would the best course of action be to not only keep him from getting sad but also to not break up?

I do really love him it’s just this is an issue for me and when I’ve vaguely brought it up before he gets really sad and asks if we should break up or take a break or cut out all sexual acts.",0,0,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,nsfw,My boyfriend sees sexual acts as a way of showing love while I don’t,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/l2sw4u/my_boyfriend_sees_sexual_acts_as_a_way_of_showing/,promo_adult_nsfw,4.0

Title pretty much says it, but for context -

We're both trans guys. We're in an online relationship. We've been on and off, known each other a little over a year.

We both have very bad dysphoria but we're both very horny teenagers. How does that work? Well it doesn't. Here's a typical interaction.

**Me: ""I'll make you do a lot more than that.""**

**Him: O\_O**

**Me: O\_O**

And now I'm worried. Because what if when we meet up in person we're super awkward. What if *it* is super awkward. I mean if we work out, we'll be 20 something with no experience. How do you even....like how is it even gonna work? Like IS IT gonna work? How do trans guys even...? What if we both end up getting really dysphoric and hating it? What if he ends up hating me? I mean we've talked about it, we've talked about it A LOT.

But idk I just keep coming back to like the same image. Of just trying to fool around irl and it being super bad and him just hating it, and never wanting to try again.

Do you guys have any tips for me? How we can mess around without triggering dysphoria? How I can like....prepare for it?

This happened last night. No backstory here, just decided to make some cream cheese jalapenos. Keep in mind I'm winging it. No recipe, no further research, just me and the peppers.

Well, for ""maximum cream cheese efficiency"" you need to gut the jalapenos. Which means getting a knife and knocking out the seeds and veins (the hottest fuckin' parts).

See, jalapenos are fairly small compared to other peppers, and their seeds get stuck in the little crevices inside. That being said, you have to get in there with your fingers as to not fuck up the pepper with a giant knife.

So I get the seeds out, stuff the peppers and let them cool. They came out alright, not bad for my first try (especially without a recipe). 7/10, prolly gonna try again later.


Here's the FU.


After dinner I had a bit of a mental breakdown. Nothing too severe, but I was just rambling nonsense to the point where my friends were concerned for my safety and told me to take a shower.

So, I decided that a shower could do me some good.

Well it *should have.*

I, wanting a dopamine rush, decided it would be a good idea to **crank one out** before hopping in the shower.

Well I did. And it wasn't long before.

*""Holy shit-""*

My little guy was **on fire.**

Turns out, despite washing my hands over 4 times with Dawn Ultra Platinum, the soap they use for ducks in oil spills, there was still a very large amount of capsaicin within my pores.

I quickly clean up and get in the shower. Hot water.

*""Holy shit-""*

Hot water and spice don't mix. Not on your skin.

Mr. Frank wasn't very happy, and neither was I.

Just to make things better, things got worse!

The hot water reactivated the capsaicin in my fingertips and essentially *teargassed* me in the enclosed bathroom.


Fun times.


Afterwards I tried everything to stop my hands from burning, my fingertips were in pain the rest of the night, they felt like they had rugburn.

It's the morning after, fingers feel better.

As for my little soldier, he's doing alright.

This situation involves my family, in particular my two brothers and myself. I am 21m, my brother D is 19, and finally N who is 16. 

Now lately there’s been tension in my house between my siblings, my parents and I. With Covid and everything we are all in each others space. I recently went through an experience with my youngest brother in which one of my female friends (21) started to take a liking to him and they were dating in private (allegedly, there was no physical contact, just emotional, no need to call Chris Hansen). Well, on New Year’s Eve my friend and I got drunk and hooked up. (I had no idea about her and N until after). Me and my lady friend are no longer friends because of how she hurt my brother and lied to us both. Good Riddance. 

However, my brother N has not been taking it too well and also struggles with depression. I also do struggle with depression a lot but my brother D doesn’t get depressed. Mostly just me and N. 

This brings us to the situation. D picked me up from work this evening and we were talking. I was saying how everyone has kinda been getting on my nerves, even N because of some things he does sometimes (not important). D and I got more into talking, hadn’t told him about N and my lady friend yet so I told him. D then revealed to me that N attempted suicide twice in the past few weeks (he tried taking a lot of Xanax). This is where my heart broke. 

I love my little brothers and would do anything for them (even though they piss me off a lot). I can’t even think about losing my youngest brother. I would be devastated. I don’t know how to talk to him, if I should talk to him, and he doesn’t even know that I know this information. According to D, N said its not because of the girl which I’m glad to hear. 

I knew my brother was sad and I give him advice but I have no idea that he would attempt suicide. I self harmed when I was his age and felt suicidal as well (still do sometimes). Now that I know he attempted this, I can never do it because I need to be strong for him as I know he looks up to me. I don’t think he knows I self harmed in high school but my scars and burns are kind of obvious in some place...

Also, since I am 21, I’m an adult and will be moving out of my house soon. I am afraid to because my brother doesn’t really like talking with my parents. Also, D will be moving out as well for school. I am scared to leave my brother alone when he is feeling like this. When I know he needs me. I also can’t stand another minute in this house, I am ready for independence. I just really don’t want to leave N.

We've been in a committed relationship for about a year now. 

I fell out of roleplaying entirely for several months last year while my BF continued and has made a lot of friends in the community. For the most part, it's been out of sight, out of mind to me. Due to it being Erotic Roleplaying and all, I have gotten jealous over the sexually lax friendships he's made, and we have had a few fights over what I feel was borderline flirting with others. These arguments have been more or less settled with him reassuring me that it's all in platonic, friendly fun as well as him dialing back the public affection with other people.

I've recently tried to get back into the RP community where we met, and actually witnessing how my BF acts out of and in-character around Erotic Roleplay with others has only made me angrier and more jealous. We've had two arguments in the past few weeks, and while they've been settled much like the past fights I've mentioned with my BF dialing things back, I'm still seeing red when people make passes at him, or when he cracks jokes about getting claimed or married to anyone who calls him the right pet name or treats his dick right.

I don't really know what to do now. My BF's gotten frustrated by me continuing to get angry after how much he's dialed back being openly affectionate with others, albeit not entirely. I'm reluctant to insist on him cutting out ERP entirely since that's where a lot of our friends are involved, so abandoning that would be losing out on a community for him, especially since he's involved in moderation. But at the same time, I keep getting jealous, angry, and tired of trying to rein in my BF.

I’m not sure if this is the right sub, so please delete if this post doesn’t belong here. My mind is a mess, so please bare with me. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over a year and a half and have been living together for \~8 months now. For much of this, we were both working from home so we spend \*a lot\* of time together. This may be cause for issues in a lot of relationships, but we’re seriously the best of friends. We communicate great, we never fight, and we are constantly laughing. Basically, he’s the love of my life.

The issue is related to sex. He’s got mild psoriasis, eczema, and subhorric dermatitis. It’s really not bad, but one of the places it effects is his man spear. I knew this going into the relationship. It was whatever, I didn’t really mind. I just wont give oral when it’s flared up, nbd. 

Well… it’s only gotten worse. I don’t want to go into too much detail, for his sake, but just imagine it’s like very dry skin that will get worse with friction. 

Because of this, throughout our entire relationship, I’ve only given him oral &lt;10 times. I refrain from prolonged handjobs to prevent irritation. You get the picture; it effects our sex life. We’re very open about it and it’s completely normal for him to decline sex if he’s healing well/it’s flared up. He puts products on daily to help. He’s been to the doctor for it in the past (about a year ago) but he doesn’t have health insurance anymore so that’s out of the question for a while. 

Basically, I miss having “normal” sex. We’re very sexually compatible when his skin irritation isn’t an issue, but I can’t pretend that it doesn’t put a damper on our sex life. Now I’m finding myself sometimes avoiding sex because of it. I know it’s difficult for me, so I can’t imagine how he must be feeling. \*\*I \*don’t\* want to make him feel guilty or insecure. \*\* I just don’t know what to do.

Masturbation is one of the big things that makes it flare up. If he masturbates one day, chances are we won’t be having sex for a day or two. I have NEVER been the type of person who dislikes when their partner masturbates (quite the opposite actually) but I can’t help but feel hurt every time he does now. I should also add that I’m on medication that significantly lowers my libido, so I’m hardly the initiator. But every time I try to initiate, he’s out of commission because of his earlier adventures.

He used to always try to initiate sex with me before taking it upon himself to get off. If I wasn’t into it, he’d go do it alone. It was never a problem. But now he hardly even tries to initiate with me. He just goes straight into the bedroom and locks the door. I feel hurt. Not only because I wasn’t invited, but also because of his skin issue I’m SOL for a few days. He’ll go while I’m in a meeting for work too so that I wont notice. Now im anxious every time I have a meeting.

I feel like he chooses masturbation over me. We’ve talked about this a few times and he always seems to understand, but then it happens again.  

Please help me reddit. I love this man so much and I miss being intimate with him. I want to be able to have sex whenever we want, without having to worry about his skin.

Obligatory i didn’t fuck up today… well kinda, it happened yesterday if that counts. 

Now, i know what you think: „She has seen your porn server, whatever.“ but i can assure you, its more complicted.

So it started as said yesterday when she out of the blue texted me that she needed my discord account and that she didn‘t want to make one. I didn‘t even know she knew what discord was but okay, pretty weird. She then wanted to message some guy about _something_ (she never tell, i never asked), but couldn‘t because that guy had like an option on where he only would text to people that where in the same server, so i helped her with that. She thanked me and i went on with my stuff

Fast forward to now, literally now as i discovered this a few minutes before writing this. Apparently that guy she was texting had a video of him fucking a girl in a (presumably) public toilet that resembled my sister. I know for a fact its not her since its full lockdown where i am and the guy is in a neighbouring country. She asked him to come out and say its not my sister in that video. He then asks her _to send a pic of her_ (i dont know why the fuck he asked this but she said she would send a pic of her fingernails to confirm that she‘s a girl). He sent the video in question asking if its that one (i hardly doubt that he has more than one of these). And now im waiting for my sisters response.


Its all really fucky as it is and im not comfortable on spying on my sister even though its on my account. I‘ll keep y‘all updated, and sorry for the formatting :/

My boyfriend has a thing for acting like an animal. He says there’s no big story behind it or anything, it’s just what he likes. He tested the waters by wearing cat ears and a tail in private when I was with him, then in bed. He pressed me about going out in public with him while he wears his ears and tail. To be clear, I have no problem with what he wears when he’s alone in public, but when he’s with me, I do feel a bit embarrassed about the animal gear and the stares. Since it’s for his comfort, we made a compromise that he could wear his tail like a belt (or tucked in), and his cat ears under a beanie, and we’ve been living that way.  


So, I was fine with everything at first, but then he started talking about being interested in furry animal suits, which can go for thousands of dollars. He hinted that he wanted one for Christmas, but I can’t afford that, on top of having to pay for my brother's hospital bills, and he was quite upset when Christmas rolled around. We had a huge blow-out argument and he blurted out that my brother was going to die anyway, and it was awful for a while. We didn't talk for a while, but he apologized, told me he didn't mean it, and promised to get a job. I thought we had put it behind us, but he recently came clean to me about having multiple secret accounts on a certain website where he was roleplaying with people online, pretending too be a girl and having them send him small bits of money so he can buy his animal suit (he is still unemployed). This disturbed me not only because it feels like cheating, but because it turned out he was sending photos of himself to these people with his face hidden and the background of our apartment showing (he'd often shave his legs, I thought it was for his comfort, but I guess it was for this too), possibly endangering us both. He did promise to stop and has deleted his accounts, but it’s left me paranoid that one of these men may not be stable and may try to track him down.  


He told me part of the reason he did all this is because he knew I wasn’t interested in having suited sex with him (or really any of this), so he thought he was killing two birds with one stone: a way to get pleasure, and earn money for more pleasure. I’ve seen one of his fellow ""furry"" friends he meets up with every once in a while gets  touchy-feely with him and make some strange references, as if they’ve done things before.

I used to be a daily marijuana smoker but my new job does random testing so I had to quit. While I was smoking I would never remember a dream I had, but now that I stopped they’ve gotten INSANELY vivid and kind of fucked up to be honest. 

The dream I had last night had me, my very recent ex, and one of my friends moms. Now it wouldn’t be bad at all if my friends mom was a milf, but she is the exact opposite. She is extremely overweight, ugly as shit, and is a huge alcoholic. My ex didn’t really play much of a part in my dream other than sitting on a couch. But my friends mom sure had quite a big role in it. 

From what I remember I was taking nude pictures of her butt ass naked playing with sex toys for some fucked up reason. I got a few pictures of her on the ground spread eagle fucking herself with a dildo then decided to get a different angle and sat on top of one of her legs. Apparently the friction of my dick being on her leg was enough to set me off because the sensation woke me up in a huge panic thinking I was about to piss my bed.. Nope... To my unfortunate surprise it definitely wasn’t piss. My chonies were covered in cum. I had to get up at like 3 in the morning to clean up and change then made the walk of shame back to bed.

I had to take this to reddit because if I told any of my friends I would get roasted into oblivion because they all know how busted she is.

I’m fairly new to piv. I’ve only been with one partner and we’ve done it maybe 15 ish times total. I’ve never been able to finish from piv alone and usually before and/or after he will just get me off and he will finish from the sex. 
The last few times we had sex I didnt really enjoy it much. For some background the first time we had sex it did not go well at all, I didn’t like it and I made the mistake of not telling him during it that I wasn’t enjoying myself even when he checked in with me bc I didn’t want to disappoint him. I know it was really stupid of me to do that. I talked with him about it after the fact and I got over it or so I thought. 

After that things were fine when we would have sex, I enjoyed it even though I wasn’t able to cum from it. Then recently when we were having sex, something hit weird and it hurt and we stopped but then I wanted to try and continue and so we did, but it wasn’t really enjoyable for me, and similar to the first time, I just tried to power through so that I wouldn’t disappoint him. After he finished and we were cuddling I started crying because I just felt so overwhelmed with emotions. I feel like part of me was upset because it reminded me too much of my first time which I really didn’t like. Since then we had sex a couple more times but it hasn’t been enjoyable for me and I didn’t tell my partner the whole truth on why I don’t really want to have sex anymore for the time being. 

I feel like I’m looking for advice on how to maybe get out of my own head about what has happened and be able to enjoy sex again. And maybe how to bring it up to my partner without it seeming like I’m trying to make him feel bad or guilty about what happened.

Now, it can't be any worse than the guy who fucked a coconut.

So, I'm like 12 or 13. I'm deep into the first wonderful throes of puberty, and all the self-pleasuring joys that arrive with the territory. I took to those joys with gusto. Any spare moment I could find were filled with what could only be described as self-inflicted molestation. My brain was dumping dopamine and oxytocin like it was an all-you-can-eat buffet in heaven.

So, I quickly grew bored of the basic stuff, and had to try new things to keep those brain rushes coming. I had never experienced anything that had made me feel so good, emotionally, in my life. I was a damaged kid who had suffered a lot both physically and emotionally, so in retrospect I was probably literally addicted to the feeling.

Anyway, so I was bored and wanted to get off trying something new, and I had of course heard about anal sex and prostate massage on this wonderful new invention called the world wide web, where I'd spend more time than I should looking at naked people doing naked things. Butt play didn't sound so bad, so I figured why not? Worth a shot.

Now I DID NOT know about the miraculous expanding abilities of the brown starfish, so I thought it could only get so big, and I didn't want to hurt myself. So I looked around the room for something small and thin. I needed something that would at least give me an idea what it wouldn feel like. My eyes fell on the wooden woodpecker. It was perfect.

Wooden woodpecker? Is this a fucking joke, you ask?  

Nope. The wooden woodpecker was a toy, a small carved woodpecker attached to a small spring and wood cylinder which would slide up down a thin length metal (or thick metal wire), attached to a wood block base. When the cylinder slid down the metal wire, it would create vibration which would cause the spring to make the woodpecker ""peck"" the metal. The top of the metal wire was topped of by our titular wood marble, about an inch in diameter.

So, why was it perfect? We'll I figured it was attached to a wire, and it was small. I could push it in quickly, see what it felt like and pull it out. No harm, no foul. Let's do it.

Dear readers, at this point I have to warn you. You all know what's coming, but if you're at all disgusted by descriptions of my oncoming actions and subsequent panic, even slightly, why are you even here? Go look at puppies frolicking with babies, or pictures of sterilized medical instruments. Anything more wholesome and sanitary than this post.

I got in position and aimed the toy, marble head first, to it's target, and slowly pushed it in. Now, this part wasn't so bad. Anyone can at least guess what it felt like. A tiny bowel movement in reverse. It was weird, but not bad. I start to pull it out. This is where the problem begins.

See, I never bothered to check how *securely* the wooden marble was attached to the thick wire. I just assumed it must have been glued on. Silly me. Here I am, trying to pull this thing outta my ass, and my ass isn't cooperating by expanding, and all of a sudden I hear a *pop*. I'm now holding the wooden woodpecker, sans wooden marble.

I. Freaked. The. Fuck. Out.

My mind was fill with pictures of thing rolling up into my intestines. What if it blocked my poo from coming out and I died?? What it it began to rot and I got splinters *inside my butt*??? WHAT IF I HAD TO TELL MY PARENTS????

I did what any insane newly pubescent teen with a wooden toy stuck up his ass would do. I shoved my hand up my butt and tried to pull it out.

I said tried, because I was not successful.

Look, it's awkward. You're not really in a good position to really, really stick your hand up there. Plus, it was so slippery! I could feel it with my fingers, but I just could not get a good grip on it. I only made it worse, because I wasn't being gentle about it either, and when I pulled my hand out there were spots of blood on it.

So now I was Panicking 5000. For the next 15 minutes, I go through the five stages of grief. 

----

""This isn't that bad, it'll be ok! I never heard of anyone dying because stuff got permanently stuck in their butt!""

""Why the hell didn't they glue that thing on better!""

""Please God, I promise to stop masturbating if you just help me get rid of it! (Haha, jokes on him)""

""I'm going to die and everyone is going to know why and laugh at me. Kids will call me Marble Butt at school.""

""There's nothing I can do. This is my life. I will live with this thing in me if I have to.""

----

OP, why didn't you just try to crap it out, I'm sure you're all asking.

Look, you're asking for rational logic from a irrational teenage masturbator. You might as well ask for Donald Trump to admit he lost.

Anyway, to end this story, I settled down and did exactly that. I was scared, because it wasn't coming out, but eventually my butt did what it was born to do and I heard a satisfying little *plop* in the toilet bowl.

Kids, learn from me. Don't experiment with your butt and loose objects. Wait until you're 30, when your parents say you can start dating.

I hope whoever reads this can help me, or at least reassure me that I'm not the one that's in the wrong. Even your thoughts no matter how helpful or unhelpful it is. I will address my older brother(21M) as T, my younger brother as C(8m), my youngest brother as D(7) (He has autism which might be a big detail, he looks like a 4 year old and can't speak a lot) and my boyfriend as Orange. For some background info. I live with my family and Orange has been staying with us since the last week of July due to having family problems my mom let him stay with us since he's not from the U.S. Orange understands english while only being here for a little over a year now. We started dating mid November but no one in my family knows.

This all happened last night, my mom works the night shift from 11pm-7am. She leaves at 10:30 to get to work on time, before she leaves I have to put C and D to sleep. D was being fussy and didn't want to lay down so I called T into the room to help me put him to bed. C is sleeping in the corner, I layed down next to C facing away from him, D layed facing the ceiling while T sat on the edge on the bed. D sleeps on his stomach so I flipped him over and started to scratch his back like always, it was quiet so I told T ""Did you know that people that sleep on their stomach have a greater chance of having a dirty dream, along with a lot of back pain?"" He replied ""Really? I've always slept on my stomach and that's never happened to me"" as soon as I finish speaking Orange opens the door and asked me a question, I didn't turn to face him but I did answer I then later said as a joke, ""Come lay down with us"", he didn't say anything so I asked T ""Is he still there"" while trying to face the door but I couldn't see anything. T says ""Yes...actually no he left"" I just said ok and tat was that, D calmed down so I told T he could go sleep in his room since he had to work early in the morning. After a while I'm laying down with D, D is in the middle of me and C so now I'm on the edge. Orange knocks on the door, he comes inside and sits next to me, since I'm laying down I just caress his face, he then later ask me ""Why did you say 'Come lay down with us'?"" I said ""Oh that, I meant it as a joke, like since everyone was on the bed other than you I just meant it as let's all be in one place."" It was quiet for a while the D turned around and started doing really weird things with his tongue. I turned to face D and said ""What's wrong?"" he just stuck his tongue out again and started moving it really weirdly then said ""Hungry"" he ate at around 4-5pm and they were just going to bed at around 10 something pm. He just sat up as I held his hand, he moved his hand away so I asked ""What's wrong"" He didn't say anything and just left the room in a hurry. D was still awake but I thought I said or did something else wrong so I left D there and told him I was going to the bathroom. (This is where everything goes wrong) I went to Orange and ask what was wrong, I told him that I didn't mean to offend him or try to upset him with what I said. He just laughed and said whatever. I said ""or did I do/say something that upsetted you?"" He just said ""I don't to start saying what's on my mind because it'll upset the both of us and I don't want to hurt you"" (I'm going to skip over small details such as the long pauses he takes, doesn't reply, or when he says ""Why should I tell you anything"" moments)

Me: Come on please tell me, I want to talk and fix things, please

Orange: What were you doing with D?

Me: What do you mean?

Orange: Really? \*laughs\* I'm not an idiot I know something's up

Me: i don't understand, I know you're not an idiot and I'm not playing dumb are you talking about what he did with his tongue?

Orange: Yes, why was he doing that?

Me: I don't know, that's the first time I've seen him do that, yeah it looks weird but he doesn't know any better.

Orange: Oh really? so it's normal that a kid does something like that?

Me: well no but-

Orange: Exactly, that means someone showed him how to do that

Me: Are you implying that it was me?

Orange: Well who else? And why did you have your head down (asking why my head was near his stomach but I was a good 6 inches away from him)

Me: Are you serious? You think I've been doing something with D? I will clarify that You are the only person who've I've done anything like that with. You were my first time with everything (sexually, as in first time, my first time giving head etc..) I've never done such a thing with him or anyone. I wasn't doing anything.

Orange: Why are you a liar?

Me: I'm not lying, I've never done anything like that with anyone much less with my own brothers. If I was why would I be doing things with you? Do you really think that?

Orange: Stop lying, an 8 year old doesn't do that with their mouth just out of the blue

Me: I know but if someone did do something with him it wasn't me, maybe at school (we've had problems at school)

Orange: BS at school? you really thing people at school would do that to a child?

Me: possibly, there's been problem at school that you don't know about, maybe my own mother but it wasn't me

Orange: \*turns around while laughing\* come talk to me when you're willing to telling the truth.

Me: I am that's why I'm here to talk, do you think I've been playing with you this whole time? We've already talking about this, we both hate cheaters, and if something happened we would tell each other. If I was doing something with my brothers or with anyone I wouldn't be doing the things that I've done with you. If I just wanted to mess around I would've gone with \*Inserts well known f-boys name\* or something

Orange: Yeah I know you'd say something and I would too, but you're obviously doing something with them

Me: Them? You mean you think I'm also doing something with C and T? or with someone else?

Me: I haven't done anything with anyone especially with my family

Orange: Why are you a liar?

Me: I'm not lying please believe me, I know you don't believe in promises or swears but I swear and promise you that I'm not doing anything with them, I don't know why D did what he did or where he learn it from but it wasn't from me.

Me: Now what's this that you think I'm doing something with T or C

Orange: Why was T covered with a blanket from the waist down?

Me: What? When?

Orange: When I went upstairs to ask you that question, he was covered from the waist down. Your mom knows something is going on between us, she has that gut feeling. That's what i'm feeling with you towards your brothers, something is going on. You know when we do something and we hear that someone's coming we tend to talk a little louder and I cover my lower half with a blanket. Before I came into the room I heard you guys speaking louder like when we do things together.

Me: I didn't see that he was covered and I don't know why, he was in there because (I explain that I needed help putting D to sleep and what I told T)

Orange: Yeah sure, so then why did he have his lower waist covered?

Me: I don't know please believe me, it's one thing that I'm lying and another that you don't believe me.

This continues for about an hour, I finished off with ""I'm going to let you go to bed though I know you won't go right away but know that I really love and care about you, I've been the most happiest when I'm with you. I know that I'm just repeating the same thing over and over again but it's because it's the truth, I've never done the things that I've done with you with anyone especially with my family. etc... But it's your choice to believe me or not since I can't change your mind. I love you."" Orange just left the room and I went to my room.

Obligatory ""this happened weeks ago"" comment

So  Im at my parents for the weekend helping out around the house, and I  just woke up from a beautiful nap, like one of those naps that feel like  you slept on angel wings. I decided i was going to go for a run in the  nice crisp autumn Texas air (we get autumn about 2 months late FYI), and  while im stretching, i notice the Recycling is full.

Now  my parents, headstrong in their ways, have finally come around to  saving the paper bags we get from the Commissary (Military HEB) (HEB is  Texas Walmart) and using them as a recycling collection center for  bottles since they drink lots of bottled soda, to this day they dont  break down their boxes either and simply throw them in this god awfully  ugly blue plastic container with one good handle and wear and tear on it  more than a 1990s convertible.

I  take out the bag no problem, and dread grabbing ol Bertha here, but im a  dedicated son who wants to help his parents, so alas I heave ol Bertha  up and proceed to walk outside the garage.

Well  it appears that the insects are enjoying the weather too, as some are  flying about. Me not paying attention, decide to take a big sniff of the  air, and Mr. Flything decides that my nostrils are a valid and  habitable environment and flies right in.

Me,  being the introverted geek that i am, feel him going in deeper than a  24 hour binge on a game, and I drop Ol Bertha on my foot, (more on that  later) Spilling the recycling all over the ground. I then make the smart  decision to try and stick my finger in my nose to fish it out.  (Surprise: it failed) After realizing it wasnt working, i then  immediately blew my nose as hard as i could (Again surprise it failed)

All  of that happened in the span of 2 seconds, i immediately ran inside to  try and drain my nose, and see what i could do, well as luck would have  it, bugs dont do well in snot. So finally get Mr. Flything out of my  nose, only to realize in my bug infused haste, Ol Bertha had landed  right on my foot, and caused a massive gauche in the skin.

Meanwhile,  My parents neighbors came over asking if there was someone staying over  because they saw ""A mentally-ill (not exact word) man carrying a  plastic container with boxes in our yard drop it and then proceed to  vigorously pick his nose""

Im being  told this, while im sitting in the docs office getting 4 stitches in my  foot, and told I cant run for a few weeks. oh and Mr. Flything caused a  minor infection in my nostril requiring antibotics.

TL:DR,  decided to take out the recyling, sniffed a bug, dropped the recycling  box on my foot, neighbor saw me and that i was mentally ill, and needed  to get 4 stitches and minor drugs.",0,0,tifu,t5_2to41,nsfw,TIFU by taking out the recycling,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/l10cmg/tifu_by_taking_out_the_recycling/,promo_adult_nsfw,16.0

I was working for a web design agency and had been there about two years at this point. My record was good, I was reasonably senior and very competent in my role. Perhaps known for being a bit of a cheeky character but I'd never been in any sort of trouble prior to this fateful day.

Anyway, my desk is next to a chap a few years younger than me who has less experience in the job but a great deal of aptitude and enthusiasm. We get along well and would frequently meet up outside work for beers and PlayStation etc. To this day I consider him a good friend.

So to the TIFU day in question. It begins like any other: the usual demands and deadlines, most people hammering away at their keyboards with headphones on. Myself and my neighbouring-desk-colleague/friend, let's call him Pete, are at our regular desks next to one another, getting on with business.

At some point mid afternoon our line manager, a woman who happened to be married to the company owner (a classic case of somebody rising to a position they didn't deserve, purely thanks to nepotism) stands up and walks over to Pete to discuss some work he's produced. She is not happy. In fact she is really pissed off.

Angry line manager proceeds to lay in to Pete in front of the whole company (there are about 25 people all in a fairly crowded open plan space), pulling no punches. It's the kind of public dressing down you might expect in the military for getting caught doing a shit in your superior officer's boots, and it's entirely unwarranted in the circumstances. The guy is still a bit of a rookie in the industry and had some very obvious strengths whilst being a bit deficient in other areas. He was ideally suited for being fast tracked down the route where he was proficient and comfortable but for some reason the company was determined to force him into doing things he was less comfortable with.

At any rate, the relatively harmless mistakes he had made on this occasion warranted little more than a quiet word to be a bit more thorough when checking work in the future. It certainly did not deserve the mother of all bollockings he was currently receiving in front of a startled audience.

Whilst many people in the office were buried in their headphones you could tell few were oblivious to what was going on, shifting awkwardly in their seats and desperately trying to avoid looking over at this brutally savage verbal beating. It was loud enough that nobody could really escape it and the contrasting looks on Pete and angry line manager's respective faces told you everything you needed to know even if you couldn't fully pick up the audio.

Now Pete is a perfectly well rounded, charming, friendly, loveable guy. He gets on with everyone. He's a really great person. But this horrendous onslaught is really taking it out of him. I wouldn't say he was especially delicate and sensitive, but you can tell he's struggling to hold back the tears. He's getting torn to shreds over something really fairly trivial and he has no option to retaliate knowing the angry line manager is sleeping with the company owner and is effectively untouchable. So he just sits there and takes it, writhing in discomfort knowing all eyes are on him.

Throughout this attack I'm trying my best to pretend I'm oblivious. I've got my headphones in and I'm staring intently at my screen, not moving my head even slightly. I often think back and wish I'd spoken up there and then, though it would have spelled the end of my career at this firm and I was in no position to just take the moral high ground all the way to the job centre.

So what did I do? In a feeble show of sympathy and solidarity I send an instant message to Pete over the company's internal messaging system that just says CUNT BITCH. I wasn't really sure anything I could write would effectively convey how sorry I felt for him right there and then but I also didn't want to patronise him. The intent was essentially ""hey, this bitch isn't worth it, you're not the bad guy here, I'm on your side bro.""

Pete didn't get the message.

You can probably imagine by this point where it ended up.

In my quiet rage at this injustice I had neglected to double check where I was firing this message. It took just milliseconds to dawn on me what I had just done. Angry line manager had my name flash up on her screen with an all caps expletive laden accusation. CUNT BITCH doesn't leave much room for interpretation and as my brain frantically scrambled to work out a way to try and justify/salvage this I watched in slow motion as her face went from the smug look of someone who has just meted out unwarranted fury on an innocent rabbit in the headlights to the look of thunder that said ""you are about to literally die.""

She declined to confront me directly and just replied to the instant message with something along the lines of ""I am too angry to deal with this right now and am going to a meeting. We'll deal with this afterwards.""

My heart sank into the earth's core and right there and then I would have given any of my major internal organs to be immediately removed from the situation. She stormed off to have her meeting and I bolted for the door. It was late enough in the day for me to legitimately be going home, if a little earlier than usual, and I sure as hell wasn't hanging around to get served an even heavier dose of the assault and battery I'd borne witness to just moments earlier.

That night I couldn't sleep. I kept replaying the situation in my head over and over. The anguish and distress was eating away at me. How would I ever return to work to confront this woman, not to mention the owner of the company, lover of the enraged Cunt Bitch in question? What chance was there of salvaging my job in such unquestionably unacceptable circumstances? How was I going to pay my rent?

Well, in the end I got up and I went to work the next day, ready to take my medicine and fully expecting this day would be my last. I was of course pulled into an immediate disciplinary hearing where the details of my misdeed were put to me. The offending message was relayed to me several times to clarify the precise nature of my offence and I winced each time I heard it uttered. I had no real defence so what did I do? Front up and accept I was a total fucking idiot? Of course not. I lied like I had never lied before.

To this day I struggle to recall the precise nature of my convoluted cock and bull story because at the time it was spewing from my mouth as quickly as I could think it up. I believe it had something to do with there being rude words unintentionally stored in my clipboard having been browsing comments left on a client site which had been somewhat disparaging, and somehow I'd pasted said profanities into an instant message which had then accidentally been sent to angry line manager. To say it was stretching believability is a major understatement. It was clear bullshit and surely nobody in the room would see it for anything else.

My tale was recorded and I was told they would ""consider the evidence before coming to a decision.""

Now, remember that prior to this I'd had not one blemish on my record. I'd never missed a day, I'd never made a mistake in my work and I was actually running some pretty major client projects. It started to dawn on me that were I to leave with immediate effect it would leave them with a very big hole to fill, though I was adamant they'd pick that option ahead of letting me get away with it.

Despite being entirely certain my days were numbered, to my surprise the decision came back that I was to be reprimanded with a final written warning, meaning the slightest step out of line in future would see me done for. The absolute fabrication of a story I'd come out with hadn't fooled anyone, but it did leave them with enough of a reason to chalk it up to sloppy behaviour rather than acknowledge I had directly insulted my line manager in no uncertain terms and had nothing but disdain for her. 

In essence I was saved by my competence. The company ran a very tight ship and had no leeway to have others take up the slack if a senior member of the team were to leave. I carried on meekly doing my job, keeping myself to myself and doing my best to ignore the sword of Damocles hanging just millimetres above my head. My search for a new job had begun the very day the excruciating event had taken place and fortunately I was offered a new role at a new company within a month.

I was able to leave the business the right way, working my notice and thanking everyone as I left. We went for leaving drinks at the pub on my final day, as is customary, but neither my line manager nor the company owner were in attendance. I didn't have to pay for a drink all night long however, going down in folklore as the hero who let the angry line manager know exactly what everyone thought about her.

Back when she was around 9 years old and for some reason was using discord, she managed to send multiple pedophiles her nudes. This included a 14 year old boy who was 5 years older than her, she didn't hit puberty and looked like a CHILD. He just got her nudes then I assume blocked her or used her for more. This resulted in her mom deleting her old discord and keeping tabs on her. Fast forward to today where I am dating her, the same boy who is now 16 years old wants to be friends with her again. For some reason he had her sister's discord and managed to talk her into letting him talk to girlfriend for a bit. Now today she tells me that she wants to be friends with him and that he was ""so nice."" We have to keep in mind he never got anything to do his pedophilia solved. He used her to nudes and yet she wants to forgive him. Every single time I tell her it is a BAD IDEA and that he probably still has her nudes and might want to blackmail her she is like ""no he changed."" Keep in mind she only exchanged like 10 text messages with him. She brings up the fact that he was bullied and honestly I definitely feel like something is wrong with his story. She also brought up attempting to commit suicide before. All of the vibes I get are manipulation from his stories that she is telling me. With the amount of excuses she is giving me I wouldn't be surprised if she wants to cheat. She said she will give me access to her discord to monitor them, but for all I know they could end up using alts to talk as well. Another major excuse she has is that she was a victim, but the problem is she is too stupid to realize that she is falling for his manipulation again. I am 13 years old, just so you know I'm not one myself.

I tried everything but nothing worked. 

Just about some months ago I asked my girlfriend for some NSFW pics of her aka nudes....and she sent them, her pics helped me a lot to a point where I stopped watching porn for about 2 weeks but then I went back to it. After that I stopped again and same thing happened over and over but everytime I’m closer to end my porn addiction. 

About 2-3 weeks ago she opened up to me telling me how insecure and uncomfortable she feels cause I watch porn and we had a fight about it, after that day I made a promise with her and myself that I was gonna stop and never gonna do it again....which I eventually broke the promise. The day I broke the promise I felt gross about it, I felt like the worst human being, I know she deserves someone better but I wanna work on myself to be that person she deserves.

Some days ago she asked me about the promise and the truth came out, I told her how I broke the promise. She feels worthless and useless for sending me her pics to a point where she told me to delete them, and since I respect her body I deleted them.

I’m trying to make her understand that her pics were the best thing that helped me to end my porn addiction, I want her to understand how her pics were so useful and so much worth. 

Another thing, my porn addiction isn’t about jerking off everyday or something like that....I used to feel alone and bored everyday before meeting her so I used to watch porn to just kill my boredom, I rarely used to jerk off, it was more for either kill my boredom or just fantasize stuff.... but it’s still something I hate about myself, I wish I never saw that website when I was kid and I wish I never betrayed my girlfriend like I did with our promise.....I’m lost right now, I don’t know what to do.....but after I saw how hurt my girlfriend was I knew I had two options and the options were either stopping my porn addiction or leaving her so I don’t hurt her anymore....her happiness is my priority and she says she still loves me but she feels disrespected and worthless so I want to stay with her, And so I’m never gonna watch anything NSFW ever again. Not after I saw how hurt she is.

All I want to know is what to do or what to say to her to believe me, these days she’s been really cold and dry with me and I know I deserve it, they’re the consequences I gotta deal with after I brome the promise....but I need to know what to do.

I've hated myself since as long as I can remember. For six years I (18F) struggled with depression, anxiety and self harm.  I started self harming because my dad left me when I was twelve. When my mom told me that I was no longer wanted, she said it was because I wasn't becoming the daughter my dad dreamed of having. I understood because, at the time, I was a raging emo kid and stuck out like a sore thumb in family pictures. I blamed myself for my abandonment and began cutting as a form of punishment. If I had just played soccer, was a little smarter and didn't look like the grim reaper, I would have still been living with him. I moved in with my mom full time after my dad left me.

When I was a sophomore, I decided to change my life for the better. I worked hard to become a better musician and student.  I had no social life for a year because I spent my time studying or practicing my instrument. The only problem was that I had unreasonable expectations for myself. So when I didn't meet these high standards, I would cut myself again after being clean for over two years. It was my fault that I wasn't smart enough to get straight A's.

Finally my junior year hit and I was really close with this kid in the marching band. I really liked him because we would vent to each other about past traumas. It was nice to have someone who understands. He developed a crush on me but I didn't feel the same. One night I got too drunk at a party and needed a ride home. I called him to come pick me up. I trusted that he could get me home safely. I've known him for a year and we told each other everything so I had no reason not to trust him. Instead of getting me home safely, he drove me to an empty parking lot and took advantage of me. I couldn't handle what he did to me. I blamed myself for getting too drunk and calling him. I didn't start to self harm after this but I started to self medicate by smoking weed.

The first time I got high was when I was twelve, but it wasn't consistent. Even when I started smoking more often after my assault, I just did it at night to help me sleep. Eventually I became a smoker all day every day. I was getting high to help me forget about my assault and how much I hated myself for my past. I started to play around with other drugs and got addicted to pills. Luckily, I was put through rehab before it got bad. However, I continued smoking weed and eventually started doing psychedelics. Psychedelics gave me a sense of security and I convinced myself that everything is okay and I no longer hated myself as much as I did for so many years.

I felt so good that I decided to join the military. I stopped smoking weed, started working out and eventually made it through boot camp. Life was great. I was cured. I talked about my past issues as a friend I used to know and saw it as something I overcame. Now I'm in A school and the rush that I was on eventually stopped. I got back into old habits of blaming myself for everything that goes wrong. 

I got my friend from back home to send me acid because it's out of your system in a couple of days and I thought it would be fun to do on base However, my trip made me realize that I'm not actually happy. I realized that I've just been suppressing my depression for a year to the point in which I convinced myself that I was a normal human being. I feel so lied to. I feel like a fraud. All the self hatred, guilt and self blame came rushing back. I realized I haven't changed since I was twelve. I'm still some dumb piece of shit. I started to trip once a week to disassociate until I eventually ran out of acid. Then I couldn't handle it anymore. I couldn't numb my thoughts. I reverted back to cutting myself. I don't belong here. I can't be in the military and be so fucked up. 

I can't get separated because my family is proud of me for moving on and (what is seems) finally getting my life on track. I wouldn't be able to handle such failure to go home after concurring boot camp and being on my own for only a month. I would feel like such a loser. The only way I knew to escape myself was by getting high. I can't do that here. Though I already have just makes me want to hurt myself even more. If I were home, I would just dive head first into the world of drugs and start experimenting with harder substances or even give pills a shot again. I can't be a deadbeat. I can't bring such disappointment to my family after convincing them (and myself) that I'm okay.

I met her child in the park one day and he started swearing at me because he was not able to get sweets this Diwali because we did not grant her the Diwali commission . I don't think I am the asshole here but I am posting here because I might be wrong.So AITA.
Note:Diwali is a very big Hindu festival equivalent to Christmas for Christians and Eid for Muslims and this is pre-lockdown

Edit:this has been going on for months and we explained and warned her many times and talked to her directly and everyone here reply was ""my parents never told me to do this and I will follow them

Edit 2: to all those people who don't understand what Diwali commision is it is basically a gift on diwali but in the form of money so we didn't dock her pay in any way we just refused to give her the gift",0,0,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,nsfw,AITA for telling my house's domestic helper to knock before entering my room,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/l3u1lw/aita_for_telling_my_houses_domestic_helper_to/,promo_adult_nsfw,23.0

I (F23) moved in with my partner (F22) right after graduating college during the pandemic. My gf is one of the best people I know. She’s been there for me at my worst and my best. We haven’t stopped talking since we started dating. She loves my family and they love her. Things have been rocky in our relationship for some time as a result of my severe OCD causing me to become fixated on the idea that I had been abused as a child with no proof. This thought paralyzed me with fear and ruined our sex life. While I was harboring intense guilt for that, my gf was feeling frustrated understandably. Despite our issues, I was still head over heels in love with her and she for me. I knew things were difficult but we just had to get through this COVID shit. Shortly prior to this, she revealed her alcoholism to me and joined AA and I joined Al-Anon.

While all this was going on she began talking with a ""gamer friend"" online. She would relay different aspects about this friend's life to me (which were pretty fascinating) and we'd talk. One time when hearing them talking over stream and I questioned the status of their relationship and was reassured they were just friends. Over a few months time they went to see each other in person. I should note during this time I have become increasingly isolated, since my move to this city, I haven’t been able to make friends due to lockdown or become a member of the community. I spent a lot of time home alone. I tried to hold back my feelings and not be the paranoid gf. I had issues with control and snooping in the past and I wanted to be better. I asked about the relationship again and was reassured. 

More recently my gf has been super depressed. She finally cracks and tells me that in addition to being an alcoholic, she is a sex addict and did indeed pursue a romantic relationship with the person that I had convinced myself wasn’t happening. She was extremely guilty. We decided that when our lease ends (august), we will live separately until she can work on her sobriety and I can work on my codependency issues and self-esteem. A month passes. I lose weight and am extremely anxious. My gf and I have productive conversations about bettering ourselves. I still feel bad about it. 

Most recently, I finally come to the realization that the cheating was sexual. She has never given me the full story of what happened and that’s the obvious reason. I confront her and I am right. The continuous lying by omission is tearing me up inside. I feel like I am starting my grieving process all over. I don’t know how to live with her. We talk because she is my best friend and companion but laying next to me makes me so sad. Every time she leaves for work I am left home alone with my thoughts. When she’s here I stare at her and can’t stop thinking about her cheating. I fluctuate between extreme rage and sadness. What was left of my self-worth is destroyed. Trying to stave off the desire to engage in harmful or risky activity by getting a tattoo. I finally started with a new therapist so there’s that but in between I feel like I’m drowning. I cry every day.

I got out of a relationship in October that had me move across the country. I immediately tried to find someone else to date to fill the loneliness. Obviously that didn't work out and I realized I just needed some time without romance. 

I began looking for a friend with benefits. I tried my best not to come off desperate, but I asked that we hang out sometimes and have sex. I'm a super, super physical person (touch is my language of love by leaps and bounds). I'm also a super sexual person. I met a few guys on Tinder and Reddit (dirtyr4r), and made it clear I wanted friendship as well as sex. Out of the 4 guys I met up with, and we were intimate, all but 1 ghosted me.

So I lowered my standards. I advertised that I was looking for an occasional ""fuckbuddy."" I don't want to raise my body count any more than I have to, so just someone to come over sometimes and have sex with me. We can do other stuff if they want, but no pressure, and I'm definitely not looking for a relationship. And of course, the few men who took me up on it (including one that I pathetically made pinky-promise me he wouldn't ghost me) ghosted me. 

When I Google'd why this is, overwhelmingly it answered that coming off too desperate, or wanting too much from someone who just isn't into me, is probably the main cause. But I've made it clear all I want is sex. 

I like to think I have a good personality. I'm polite, clean, and I think I do just fine in the sexual encounter. I'm not the prettiest- I'm overweight, and I know that's a lot of the reason why I'm not ""date-able"" right now but I am ""fuck-able."" I've been completely upfront with every guy: I just want sex, maybe friendship, but it's no pressure. And every single guy, I get along with well, we have sex, then he stops talking to me either the next day or a few days after.

Please, please tell me how to remedy this. I don't want to keep adding to my body count. I also don't want to be used for a ONS (which I specify is not what I'm interested in). I have been blunt in my expectations, and either I'm attracting not-great guys, or there's something wrong with me.

My daughter and I were in our living room watching a kids' movie while I was scrolling through Facebook. I come across a post with a video of a guy who wakes up his girlfriend by singing to her using a karaoke machine. It's funny and silly and my daughter wants to see it, so I show it to her. 

She laughs and wants to see the next video which is of the same guy singing another song to his girlfriend. Why not, right?  Well, this is where I fucked up. The song starts out okay and I'm paying attention but can't really understand what he's saying at first. That is, until he gets to the chorus which is loud and clear: ""I'm not going to eat your ass."" 

He said it so fast and kept repeating it that by the time I was able to stop the video, he had said it 2 or 3 times. My daughter thinks it's hilarious and now won't stop singing it as loudly as she can. I tried to convince her that it actually says ""I'm not going to eat giraffes,"" but she knows I'm lying.

Last night, we stayed up talking to each other as we usually do and in a deliberate attempt to make her uncomfortable (don't worry I asked for permission before) I brought up increasingly sexual topics. We've never really talked about those sort of things so I believed she would quickly accept defeat. However, she did not. In fact, she seemed quite excited. I don't know if she had been waiting to talk about those sorts of things, but I myself felt quite uncomfortable.

I didn't tell her in the moment because of my pride but it was very... shocking to be discussing those sorts of things with not anyone, but the person that I genuinely love. I know if it was to go as planed, we'd end up here anyway but I simply wasn't prepared for it to happen so quickly or the sheer amount of information I'd be bombarded with. Information like she would enjoy giving oral sex to her partner and would prefer it as it's less intimate and she'd be better at it.

I know for a fact she is not at all interested in acting on her frankly lust-driven opinions, specifically with me as she outlined that to begin with, primarily due to fear, and partially due to the current situation (COVID). I also know that I am in no way interested in actually doing those types of things - again, I expected to get to this point, just not so quickly. Despite knowing this however, I am still finding it difficult to get rid of her out of my head. Before it used to be normal things like her smile and laugh. But, now it's taken a dark turn.

I want to stop thinking of her in a sexual nature and go back to being wholesome.

i leave to go to school at 7:15.

The dryer started at around 7:20-7:30

Also, am on mobile and sleep deprived. Sorry for the long post.

My boyfriend moved to a country for business related reasons 4 months ago. He's super caring, understanding, patient and supportive. Ever since we began this long-distance relationship, I have became touched starved and so did he.

So what did we do? Send nudes and help each other jack off, talked sexual things etc etc. 

But after a few days of starting the long-distance relationship, all he had ever wanted was just us doing sexual things. No calls, only texts. And he always seem to fall asleep after our ""sessions"". I have a serious trust issues and insecurities. I was also ghosted, cheated on and used only for sex by my exes in the past too.

So I started to lose sleep, stress and cry about how history could be repeating itself again. I told him how I felt (like I'm being used only for sexual favours) and he apologised, saying he was getting to greedy with his desires. We then promised to be more honest with each other. But somehow, from that day on, i felt like he has hidden a part of him away from me. He use to say that he loves me and texts me often but now, i'm usually the one sending more texts and saying ""i love you"" more often. I want to trust him I really do but i saw him liking other girls explicit and nude photos on Twitter once and I confronted to him about it. He confidently lied to me that there was ""no other girl than me"" and that he only ""looks at me"". He admitted after all the probing.He has then willingly deleted the account as he ""has no use for it"" anymore. 

Anyways, i got carried away. My point here is, I tell him everything about me and my day but he tells me nothing about his. Everytime i tell him that I want to do what couples would do in a long-distance relationship (like calling) or that i want to spend some quality time with him talking and bonding, he would keep trying to make it sexual with me and we end up either not doing what I had hoped for or just me having a one-sided conversation.

I’ve been with my boyfriend for about a year now and we’ve been sharing a bed and sleeping together for almost our whole relationship. He gets hot easily so he prefers to sleep with as little clothes as possible, whereas I prefer to wear a shirt or loose bra and panties. He has always just worn boxers to bed. 

About half a year ago he asked if he would mind if I would mind if he slept without boxers that night and I was like “sure, it’s summer so it’s hot” and thought he would just start wearing boxers after the summer. He hasn’t worn boxers when we sleep together since that one night.

I like spooning and being the little spoon, but doing it while his penis is rubbing against my but is not comfortable. Especially on days I wear thongs and it’s rubbing against my bare ass. He also gets turned on quickly so most of the time when we’re spooning I’ll have a boner poking me in the butt. 

I’ve asked him to wear boxers for a week once because I was noticing weird spots in my sheets and he got really offended that I was wanting him to be really hot at night and that I was blaming him for the weird spots (they were on his side of the bed where I don’t even come.) He hasn’t been over for a couple weeks because he’s sick and I haven’t had any of the weird sports return, even with me using the whole bed now.

What happened was, I have this pair of truck horns, which I got when I was a kid.  I don't have an air compressor, so there is a hand pump to blow air through the horns.  The pump needs to be pretty sturdy to expel enough air to get these things going, 50-60 PSI at minimum I'd estimate, as they usually would use like 120 PSI on a compressor.  So, the pump is made of steel, and fairly beefy.  It requires so much force that typically a smaller person won't get the second horn to go (low pitch and higher pitched horns are connected together to make a chord, the higher ones are harder to make sound with), but thankfully I'm able to.  

Anyway, on to what actually happened, since it's new years and this was a pretty crappy year, I'd decided to inform the entire neighborhood (and probably the surrounding city) that the new year was here, and brought up the horns from the basement.  I set them on the back porch, and watched my watch for the timing.  I had the air canister portion of the pump in my hands, and planning to slam the handle end into my leg to sound the horns, in hopes of making them be louder.  At exactly midnight, I slammed the air pump into my leg, the force depressing the handle into the pump, making the horns blow.  Unfortunately, this did not go to plan.  Remember how I said the thing was made of steel?  Well, it slipped right off my sweatpants, right into my genitals.  I didn't notice the pain right away, but it came.  Oh, I forgot to mention, the handle was shaped like an old fashioned ship wheel, so there was more pain than there could have been.  So there I am, laying on the ground in pain, wondering why I didn't just use the ground Instead.  

Turns out, that wasn't all the damage.  I hit my leg so hard there was even some internal bleeding, and two huge welts.  

TL;DR: wanted my truck horns to be louder and doing so caused me to almost be sterilized and caused great bruising to my leg

I've (29F) been with BF (37M) (not married) for 3 years. We've lived together for 2. He and SD had been living with his parents for 8 years. In October 2019 he bought a house. SD began living with us when the pandemic started. BF and BM (baby momma) have a parenting agreement, they split time 50% but BF has residential custody. SD is with us every other weekend and half the week.

Last Summer my phone broke. I got a new phone. We talked about giving SD my old phone after repairs, because at our new house we lived close to the park and she could go out and play. She was 10 at the time. I had major reservations, but we compromised that we would put Google family link on the phone. We can shut the phone off at any time and limit certain apps. Aside from her being on it almost all the time, and occasionally asking to stay up later, it's been okay. I can't see everything that she's doing or saying, but I know at least how long she's been on it. 

My reservations came from an incident last spring with her tablet. Christmas of 2019 BF got her a new tablet. 3 months later it broke because she took it into the bathtub with her and dropped it in the tub. SD had an older iPad mini that she used as backup. I got suspicious as to why she had the tablet in the tub with her. So I went into the iPad mini to monitor what she was doing. I found the app IMVU, a teen app, and she had basically been cyber sexing people on this app. She was 10 years old telling people she was 20. We had a very intense conversation with her, lots of tears, with a promise that she would behave and that we had the right to go through her stuff at any time because she was 10. She didn't get in big trouble because this was the first incident.

So that's what I was thinking of when BF proposed the phone. 

I've been trying to keep tabs on what she does. BF doesn't care at all. He will give her extra time whenever she asks. He lets her stay up on school nights if she asks, and there's no consequences or discussion if she gets up late. I have a problem with this. She's also been very moody, I think she's going to get her period, which does not help at all. 

I feel like I've been the disciplinarian since she moved in with us. I'm the one that cares if she cleans her room or not. I'm the one that monitors her phone. The only chore she has is to take out the trash which pays for her cell phone plan. BF gives into her, and I understand completely. He says he wants to be the cool dad. Well if he's the cool dad then that makes me the bitch stepmom. he's even told me that I should stop calling her out on things, like when she leaves trash in the living room or sneaks down into the kitchen to get snacks without saying anything to us in the living room. She had a friend over in the basement and didn't clean up for two weeks until she wanted another sleepover.

I come home from work on the days she's with us after school, and as soon as I walk in she goes up to her room. She talks back and argues about anything she has to do. She'll be in her room for hours saying that she's ""relaxing"". After her hard day of what?? She's in hybrid School so she doesn't go to school every single day. On the days she doesn't go to school she stays with Grandma during the day. it's a fight for Grandma to get her to do her work. This is coupled with the fact that she keeps forgetting things. She forgets stuff at grandma's, she forgets stuff at BMs. There have been two times where we've driven to Grandma's at the end of the night because SD forgot something, when it turns out it was in her bag the entire time. But I'm getting off track.

This morning I was checking her photos on messenger kids and saw something from her tiktok. Apparently she made a second tiktok which we weren't aware of. There are videos of her dancing in cosplay which are mostly appropriate. But in her bio she talks about ""yarichin"". I look it up and it's freaking anime porn. ""Yarichin Bitch Club"". I found an episode online and there's dudes at a school, having sex, showing full (blurred) penis.

So, I'm livid. We don't have SD this weekend, but I want to shut her phone off right now. BF is still in bed and I don't want to bombard him as soon as he wakes up with this. I'm just trying to find a good game plan on how to handle this. We talked to her once about it, I thought everything was okay, but apparently it's not. She doesn't know how to handle herself online. Why would you post that you like that anime as an 11 year-old on tiktok? She wants us to buy her wigs so she can start cosplaying as these characters on tiktok. She asked us for the stuff before I found out what it's from.

I could sell feet pics, I'm not sure I have the prettiest feet and most of the people who I've seen sell them are white (which I am not) so I'm a bit worried that might lessen my chances of making money. Also there are different people who give different rules like one who says don't paint your toenails and another person encourages it so the rules/tips are a bit confusing.  I'm willing to make videos of me stepping on things too (I've heard people pay extra to see feet step on cake and other foods).

I have also thought about art. My drawing/painting skills are improving and I've heard people (especially furries and people in the fetish scene) will pay good money for commissions. Is this true? If so how can I start get into this?

One more thing I've heard people pay for is erotica or commissioned stories. I am practicing creative writing and was wondering if when I feel I'm good enough would like to try it out. Is that 

If anyone has advice or suggestions please let me know!

TL;DR: I'm very broke and am looking into ways of making money (selling feet pics, drawing fetish art/furries/anything others won't, writing erotica). I just need advice as to how to get into it and any other suggestions.",0,0,NoStupidQuestions,t5_2w844,nsfw,What are some alternative things I can do to make money (NSFW or otherwise)?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/ktgl2o/what_are_some_alternative_things_i_can_do_to_make/,promo_adult_nsfw,6.5

I (20F) have been with my boyfriend (22M) for 2 years. He’s the love of my life and I can picture myself marrying him one day. When we first got together, the sex was great, and we would have sex every time we saw each other, sometimes multiple times, so probably between 2-7 times a week. For the past year though it’s just been downhill. I know it’s not as bad as other people, but I’m scared it’s just going to end up there. Now we have sex about once or twice a month. 

I have tried everything I can. I’ve tried multiple times to discuss this with him, as we’re very good at communicating everything else, but this just gets us no where. He used to come up with excuses and now he can’t even do that. Now he just gets mad when I bring it up. It seems like the only time we have sex is the day after we talk about it, which makes it feel more like a guilt fuck than anything else. It makes me feel worse. He always says he’ll “try harder” and then nothing ever changes.

I want to bring up an open relationship, because at this point I’m so unsatisfied sexually I’m just frustrated, but I know he wouldn’t take it well. I’m just at a loss of what to do next. I don’t want to break up, but I just don’t know what else there is to do. Nothing I try seems to change anything, and I’m getting more and more annoyed with the situation every day. He refuses to admit there’s anything bothering him or making him unhappy with the sex we have, and the sex we used to have was great, but now it feels like he only does it just so I can’t say we don’t have sex. And almost every time we have sex I’m the one who initiates. I want to feel like he wants me sometimes too.

15m don’t normally feel nervous when talking to girls and can hold a normal conversation fine. But holy fuck can I not flirt at all.

Then her and a friend were talking, her friend says she’s in a real mood to go with someone, and she says in a really loud obvious tone “yeah I really want to go with someone to!” And looks over at me. And again I fucking broke and stood there and looking back I’m cringing so fucking hard. 

I’m literally so useless at this shit.

I didn’t wait long enough to have sex after getting stitches removed, and I bled inside my girlfriend’s vagina. 

As I write this, I lay here in bed, next to my woozy girlfriend, waiting for the blue balls to hit me.

I noticed a small bump on my penile shaft about a month ago, and a little over a week ago I decided to figure out wtf it was.  I posted on r/AskDocs, but you know that everyone on Reddit has a tendency to assume the worst.  I knew for certain that it couldn’t be HPV or any other STD, but Reddit told me otherwise.  The next day (last Thursday) I went to the dermatologist to get it figured out.  

At the dermatologist, she identified it as a cyst.  She removed it, and the first time I had stitches, they were in my cock.  To add insult to injury, the nurse lady that helped was someone I had a crush on in high school.  

Anyway, I immediately think, “oh shit, I can’t have sex with my girlfriend for 8 days.”  We have a healthy sex life, and I wasn’t happy about having to wait.  

Eight days go by, and now we’re here – present day.  I’m so excited to get my stitches out.  In other words, the day I get to have sex again.  I double checked and asked the nurse twice if I could have sex.  She told me yes, everything is back to normal.  Oh hell yeah! 

Hours go by as I’m thinking about finally having sex again.  It’s great.  It feels amazing.  I’ve missed it.  As I get nearer to finishing, and I continue thrusting, I think to myself, “wow, she hasn’t been this wet before.”  I pull out to move positions so that the important pull out is easier: “uhh, babe, you’re bleeding.... or I’m bleeding.”  I looked on the underside of my dingaling, and sure enough, my closed scar was no longer closed.  

Blood covered my scrotum; it looked like we had sex on the heaviest day of her period.  I bled inside her.  She rushed to get me a bandaid, but she had to wipe herself up first.  Again, just to make it worse, she’s terrified of blood (she once passed out just from seeing a pimple bleed), so she has to take a break to breathe and try not to throw up.  

Well.. yep.  I fucked up.  If you just got stitches taken out of your dick, I know how horny you are.  However, give it more time than I did.  Don’t do what I did.  

[Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/C8bwDmU) for you weirdos that want to see.

EDIT: All is well.  Bleeding stopped soon after.  It looks fine this morning — no signs of infection.  I don’t plan on going back to the doctor unless it continually bleeds or has any other kind of discharge or discomfort.  I plan on routinely applying Vaseline and/or Neosporin.  Thanks for the comments and the awards.

(Also, English isn't my first language, so please bear with me. Also, I don't think my age would be relevant, but it's 25, and I'm not putting in my friend's age 'cause I don't want to expose her more than this, so let's just say we're all around the same age.)  
At the beginning of last year, my best friend matched with this guy on Tinder, they got along well and I think they talked a lot. She said he mentioned being interested in having an open relationship, and she told me that her answer was like ""yeah, I'm interested in *learning* more about it"", and I remember her telling me she wanted to learn more about polyamory before. It seemed like she was really into this guy and she told me that he seemed *very* much into her.  
Then, one day they scheduled to meet up at his house (it was before corona hit us), and she told me that she \[+18 flag\] gave him head, and he was so forceful she ended up hurting her throat and throwing up on his dick a little, but he loved it (???) and she pretended that everything was fine, even when she didn't get off.  
Up to this point there's not much to it, she said they both stated that they wanted something serious, so she wanted to keep dating him and all. But after that date, well, actually, the very next day, the dude met and fucked another girl. Without my friend's consent. I think that must have been what he meant with an ""open relationship"": he gets to fuck other women without talking about it with her, but that's totally not how open relationships work, like, at all. That was actually him cheating on her on the very next day after they had sex for the first time.  
After that, she broke it off with him and that was it. She got sad afterward but they weren't together for that long, so the sadness didn't last long. What happened did kind of traumatize her about open relationships though, which was something that she was interested in before, never got around to trying out, and then she met this asshole. I talk to her a lot about this, to ease her mind, but it's a long process, and I'm not going to rush her into feeling better.  
The thing is: my friend snooped around in his social media (unhealthy, I know), and it looks like he started dating another girl. And it's someone I know, we went to the same university, and she's a really sweet person. And from time to time, I think to myself ""I should warn her"". I don't know about you guys, but I think that it's very rare for someone to cheat only once, and only in one relationship, and I'd like to warn her about that possibility. On the other hand, maybe they're in an open relationship, and that's none of my business? Maybe what he did to my BFF wasn't that awful in other people's eyes? Please, leave your opinions below, and thank you very much for your time.  


Tl;dr: This guy dated my best friend, had sex with her for the first time one day, then cheated on her by fucking another girl the very next day.

This is a bit of a brag and a bit of an ask for advice. 
So I (M36) have been with my wife (F33) for 11 years. She was my first sexual experience which I really don’t mind and I am happy with it staying that way. I was a late bloomer but happy. My wife had multiple experiences with other people before me and I have never held this against her realising I was the less conventional one. 

Now she has a sister also 36 and she is quite close too. SIL is quiet, shy and as far as we are aware has never been romantically involved with  anyone. I understand the difficulties that being a virgin later in life can have on self esteem and how as time goes on it gets to be a bigger and bigger thing. My wife knows she is definitely a virgin and definitely heterosexual. 

We have never considered an open relationship and never really considered any type of threesome scenario etc. My wife had expressed before now that she feels sorry that I didn’t get to experience more. I am happy and content but I would be lying if I said I didn’t have urges. We are a happy couple and happy to talk about celebrity crushes etc. 

My SILs situation has been growing in my wife’s mind recently and previous to COVID my wife was taking her out to try and help her to making the first steps. SIL wants kids but like I said her concerns for time etc are growing. So my wife has now brought up to me that maybe I should “date” her sister and be her first sexual experience. The thinking is that I am a man she already trusts, I know what I am doing and I will treat her with respect and allow her the space to gain the confidence with men she lacks. The bonus for me is that I get to try something different. Her sister is quite different from her different hair colour, slim athletic figure with a flat chest. I see these differences as a bonus as my wife is my ‘type’ but change can be fun too. The SIL is also into yoga and super flexible! 

We are confident our marriage can take this new angle and I have suggested that if my wife wants to “try something different” as well. I will be fully supportive. Practicality wise we are planning a chat group between the three of us so all communications also involve my wife. Nothing would happen in our family home but at the SILs place. I would turn up, spend some time with her like a date and progress to the bedroom. There would be no possibility of a three in the bed scenario. My wife isn’t curious/incestious at all and isn’t sure of the three of us being naked together. 

The questions are how do we bring this possibility up to the SIL and are there any other pitfalls to this? 

Sorry for the long explanation and this is a throw away as you would expect.

So I have to go back a bit to explain the whole story 


It’s summer in Australia right now so it’s pretty hot, I hop in bed and start sweating so me being a smart intellectual person I take off all my clothes

So I’m lying there in bed sweating, it’s 2 am at this point and I’m pretty dehydrated so I decide to get out of bed and get a drink (keep in mind my bed is a bunk bed) 


So I sit up and start climbing down out of bed when I suddenly start feeling nauseous and dizzy, I can’t see anything because it’s pitch black and for some reason I still haven’t put my clothes back on


So because I’m nauseous and dizzy and I can’t see I end up falling out of bed onto the ground making a noise I can only imagine sounded like a bomb going off to the rest of my family 


Feet start shuffling lights get turned on and people are talking, then they all come in my room and see me laying on the ground dizzy and naked

Remember I don’t have anything clothes on and to make things worse my auntie is staying with us

So there I am lying on the ground naked and everyone is asking if I’m ok and then I hear a line come out of my auntie’s mouth that made my whole face go tomato red

All she said was “it’s sooo hairy” everyone stopped talking looked down and bust into laughter

They eventually go to bed after making sure I’m ok and I go to bed as well 

Now that you know the back story this is where it actually begins


So it’s a few days later and I’m in the shower where most bad memories emerge and I remember the incident from a few days prior 

So I decide to get some scissors and do a little grooming, I finish trimming and I’m feeling pretty good about my self 


So I put my finger through the hole in the handle of the scissors and start spinning them around and doing tricks like with a butterfly knife

While I’m doing so, I open my mouth as a pubic hair on the scissors comes flying off and enters my mouth 

I didn’t realise I had inhaled it until I tried to breath in, so then I start choking on this pubic hair that was on the scissors 

I’m trying to drink the shower water hoping it might be swallowed or dislodged (to no avail) 


I keep trying to cough it up but it’s not working, then a family member hears my coughing and asks if I’m ok, when they don’t get an answer they realise something isn’t ok and barge through the door

They see I’m chocking and start trying to make me cough it up, they tell someone to call an ambulance while patting me on the back trying to get it to come out

While all this is going on in my brain I’m just thinking “am I really going to die from choking on my pubic hair?” 

Eventually I start trying to make my self throw up by putting my hand in my mouth and after a good 20 seconds I manage to throw it up

While I’m sitting there catching my breath for a good 5 minutes the ambulance show up 

I have to explain to them that I’m ok now and embarrassingly tell them what I was chocking on and how I managed to choke on it

The ambulance leave and my entire family starts dying of laughter while I sit there going tomato red in the face

This whole thing happened about a year ago and we still joke about it now

I am nice to women in hopes they will, eventually, see me as a romantic partner. And even though I don't pursue any romance with them and just continue being nice and hope they'll make the first move, I get very angry when they completely see me as a friend. Thankfully though, I don't lash out at them and just rant about it on 4chan- and even slowly cutting contact with my failed targets.



After my most recent episode, I suddenly realized that I am a ""nice guy"" and immediately asked myself what the hell am I doing. I've been getting angry at a woman for seeing me as a friend despite me not doing anything to further our relationship.



 I realized I have been extremely idiotic. 



I guess my teen brain thought since women always moan about wanting a nice guy, I thought that if I was a nice guy, they'd immediately jump on me. But now I realize that's not the case.



What do I do now? How do I fix my thinking when it comes to romantic relationships? And especially on women? I understand they're just humans like us and have their strengths and weaknesses. But a conflicting part of me believes they're all whores.


I am sorry if this post upsets anyone. I genuinely want to change my ways before it's too late (don't wanna be like this in my 20s, 30s, and so on) but I have no idea where to start. How do you even repair a worldview?

I appreciate it as your comments have really opened up my mind and made me realize how toxic my thinking really is. Heck, in this post alone, I  subconsciously referred to women as targets and subhuman. Hopefully I'll be able to fix/change this thinking soon.

About a month and a half ago she had issues around her genitals and started showing symptoms.  She apparently tested positive shortly after without telling me, and lied / stretched the truth and said it was some sort of bacteria infection.  We went about 3-4 weeks without having sex because she wanted her ""bacteria infection"" to heal, and then we started having sex again (I had been wanting it, and she finally was comfortable and initiated it).  We always have unprotected sex and have been for the last year we have been dating.  This weekend she got very emotional and confessed to testing positive for Herpes.

I am calling my doctor first thing tomorrow to get tested. Our relationship has been okay/good for the most part but we've certainly had our ups and downs. There's been a few instances we've almost ended it, especially recently, but overall I do care about her deeply and have feelings of affection towards her. I don't think she cheated on me and that isn't really the issue here, plus according to what her doctor told her either one of us could have had this in our systems lying dormant so there is a chance I had it and was asymptomatic and gave it to her.

When she told me the news hit me hard, especially so because I've never had anything like this happen before.  It is not sitting well with me at all and quite frankly am thinking about ending the relationship.  If she had told me she recently tested positive for herpes I would have never consented to having sex with her, and if she told me a month ago I would have known by now if I have it. The thought of kissing or having sex with her right now is completely out of my mind due to the herpes - I don't know enough about it and the risks involved. I've also never been with someone (knowingly) with an STD so this is new to me and not something I am entirely comfortable with at this point, and least not without doing more research.

Her reasoning was basically that we've already been having unprotected sex for a year and since neither of us cheated, one of us had it the entire time and I likely already have it, and we would have never known if she didn't have a random outbreak. It was also that she was afraid of losing me if she told me. She has been struggling with the diagnosis as well as personal things and has mentioned to me that she was somewhat suicidal, and we had grown apart a bit during the 3-4 weeks without sex as she was colder and on edge and dealing with this alone. I can understand why she felt this way and I feel a lot of genuine sympathy for her, but in my opinion she absolutely needed to let me know about her STD before we had sex so I could truly consent to the sex and the risks. She had apparently been taking medication to fight/suppress the outbreak and waited until everything was supposedly under control with it before we had sex again. I know this isn't a life threatening STD like HIV and apparently it is pretty common to have but still I don't think there is a difference here when evaluating what happened.

I'd appreciate any input. At the end of the day I don't really want to lose her, but I don't think what she did was right and I'm conflicted.

Using a throw away for obvious reasons.

Earlier this year I got accused of sexually assaulting two of this person's friends when they were 18/19 (I am in my late twenties at the moment, this would have been in my mid twenties). It supposedly happened during a photo session. I am a photographer.

Here's a few issues I have. I have never been intimate with anyone 18 or 19, the small list of people I have been with have been older than me. When I was in my early 20s I went after late twenty year olds and as I got older I have been with women as old as 45. Still, maybe they changed the age to protect the person. Okay. I reached out to everyone I have been with to ask if our activity was consensual and they all said yes, but some thought it was weird I hit them up after not talking for several years. And is it possible that one person lied? Sure.

Also, my mental health is bad as it is, I have severe anxiety, I have an incredible amount of paranoia, so much that I even planned for something like this to eventually happen. I knew at the start of my photography that I never want to be alone with someone in case of a false accusation, so I mostly did casual sessions outside in busy parks where there was always hundreds of witnesses, parents, children, and even police patrolling occasionally. I am just going on a limb but if someone were to want to assault someone, doing it in front of a cop would not be a good idea, and I thought if all my shoots were in public then that could protect myself. Also, I use contracts and I check ID. When I got to bigger sets I would ensure a makeup artist, stylist and a set designer was around. I always encouraged people to bring friends.

I have also been raped in the past, and I promised myself I would never ever make someone feel how I felt that day. It's years later but I can remember it perfectly and it is terrible.

And another thing-I hate sex, I hate it. I have wanted to be a girl since I was 5 and I am now almost 30. Having intercourse is so invalidating, I don't go out of my way to seek it. When I did have sex it was because I wanted to appear normal. I wanted to fit in. If I had a sex life, people might not suspect I am trans, right? But if I don't get any, I'm okay with that. Now, I know it's weird I'd be posting in a men's group, but I live as a guy and I grew up as a guy.

Another thing I noticed it is hard for me to trust women now, and I \*want\* to trust women. It's hard because I have always said believe all women, but I can't say ""believe all women unless they're talking about me"". But what is the alternative?

But what scares me is the self doubt. What if I did do this? what if its my memories that are wrong? if I did it, I should absolutely be held accountable, but I have only had sex once with my camera out (that was an ex, not a client or a model) and I cannot believe I could have done this. I couldn't live with myself. I couldn't live with myself if I hurt someone. It doesn't make sense. Do I have such bad judgement of age that I mistook a 40 year old for an 18 year old? Did an 18 year old tell me they were 42 and I believed them? Did the person make this up? Why does everyone believe them? How does one prove a negative, that I didn't do anything?

I go to school for photography, and it seems like very little came from this. The individual never went to the police, or my school, though they did write all over social media. Surprisingly, a few people do believe it, but it hasn't seemed to affect me socially much, but I'm scared that might change one day.

If I lose my career, I don't think I could live with myself. There is nothing else I enjoy doing in life. I go to the school of my dreams, and I was under the impression they would comb through my life to find every little secret. I acted with the belief that if I did something wrong, it would be discovered. I did nothing to jepordize my career...

&amp;#x200B;

\----------

I also wanted to talk about my experience trying to get support and vent about it. It seems the only groups that will even let me talk about this on Facebook are groups with men that I am certain are guilty (the things they say exonerate them, don't) or groups where men talk about hating all women and are talking about being red pilled and calling me Chad and stuff (an ideology I don't agree with). So I feel especially alone right now. If I don't trust the accounts of the men in these supposed support groups for the wrongly accused, why would anyone believe me? What if no one believes that I've only shot outside during that period? I can produce all the images I want that were taken outside, it would be easy to say there's more I simply didn't upload because it didn't fit my narrative.",0,0,TrueOffMyChest,t5_2yuqy,nsfw,Being falsely accused has made my mental health worse,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/kuqugl/being_falsely_accused_has_made_my_mental_health/,promo_adult_nsfw,2.5

For example, man and woman are at a social gathering. Man and woman choose to go to to one of their places to hook up. Woman decides she doesn’t want to have sex, or retracts consent in the middle of sex, man doesn’t listen and rape has occurred. Woman goes home and doesn’t say anything for a little while, but ultimately decides to go to the police. What, realistically, is to be done about that situation from a legal standpoint? No proof of what happened except for her statement, and he denies that she ever retracted consent. 

It’s a really hard scenario, and it also happens to be the most common type of sexual assault. It’s one thing if a rapist is violent and aggressive and there’s physical proof of sexual battery. But in this case, it’s basically a choice between whether you believe the woman, or the man.

In my pondering I had this question to myself. If my daughter hooks up with a man in his 30's the day before she turns 18, does even make a difference? Is it still wrong? And if that's wrong what about 2 days before? 3 days before? Or even the day of her 18th birthday? I don't think a 24 hour difference still doesn't lessen the creepiness of it and would reduce my feelings towards it. I'd still feel like a grown ass man (or woman) abused my child. It's got me thinking that maybe 18 is still to young or the concept is flawed. Any thoughts? I know I probably didn't articulate this as well as I could

Edit** this isn't me being concerned about my daughter's particular sex lives. I'm just curious on the concept of a age of consent that's put at 18.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for 4 years now and he is a very hypersexual person and masterbates basically every night. I was curious a few days ago, I asked him what he thought about when he was masterbating. I was expecting a fun, kinky conversation but instead he went on to list 10-20 of his female friends and coworkers and how he thinks about them having sex with each other or having orgies together. Obviously I was shocked and had no idea what to say. 

I told him that made me uncomfortable since he is very close to his female friends and talks to them about relationship advice involving me and they play video games together all the time so it made me think he would cheat on me if it ever came up. He insisted he has never cheated and would never cheat on me. He told me I was overreacting and he is allowed to think about whatever he wants. I think that is true and he is flirting with his friends and is not hurting anyone, but I still feel uncomfortable and inadequate especially when we have an active sex life (3 times a week at least). The whole conversation ended with him telling me “respectfully agree to disagree”

I already feel so stupid for asking. I feel like everything would be okay if I had never wanted to know. I think about breaking up with him a lot now since I know this, but I would feel guilty if it was over something so personal like this. That has kept me up for nights in a row now and I have no idea what to do. 

How do I be okay knowing this? He says all men think about their female friends like this and its just nature. That worries me and I don’t know how to live accepting that. I feel so lost.

I’ve never known anyone who had Parkinson’s disease, but I suspect I might be at or near the same level. I can smell if someone is obese, or using crack, or a heroin addict, just standing next to them, because each of them, to me, has a very distinctive and powerful odor. (I’ve only known a few addicts, but it’s always the same.) 

I’d really like to be part of a study to dig deeper into this.  And the really bizarre thing is that my olfactory sense is this refined despite being a heavy smoker.  I’ve actually been low-key terrified of quitting smoking and becoming even more sensitive to scents.

I used to work on a big financial institution and every six months some of the employees used organize a very big party and was meant to drink your problems away, drink to make new friends, drink with your boss, and most importantly drink to try hookup with that person you were flirting (or all of the above) with for the last month on the company chat. This was the event of the semester, and everybody that didn’t have kids at home would be there. Important to highlight that this happens on Thursday night, and everybody had to work next morning.

I was in the category of people that was just there to drink a lot, but there was one girl that I had been flirting with for a while, but I never thought I had a real chance, just though we were being friendly and playful. A few hours go by and see this girl with two bottles of tequila in her hands just giving shots to everybody, and it finally was my turn to drink some. I drank without hesitation of course, but some of my friends were showing some resistance. This girl and I made a deal that we both would drink one shot for each person that drinks one too. Huge mistake, twenty minutes later we were as drunk as on can be. Blackout here
Next thing I know I’m outside making out with this girl, and my friends keep trying to get my attention saying they are going to Uber home and asking if I coming too (after party). I signal 👍🏻 with my hand and they share the uber fee with me but I never entered the car because I was still making out with the girl. A few minutes go by she asks if I want to go to her place with some other friends. I say hellyes. We get there with two other couples that quickly found a room, and I made the huge mistake to lay down in her bed while she went for water or something, 30s after that I’m puking on the floor, and she comes back to the sight of me laughing while letting all we drank out. She is nice about it and tells me to go shower while she cleans the room. She then proceeds to check on me in the shower just to find me sleeping standing up in the shower. She is laughing her ass off and saves me from drowning in the shower. While I was getting dry I was angry because I didn’t want to put clothes on and ran out of the bathroom naked! 

When she finally made me calm down we went to sleep ( I was still naked).
Blackout here.

Wake up Friday morning feeling like shit, not knowing where I am or why I am naked... she wakes up to get ready for work, I had a day off strategically on this day just to hangover on my own. While we are getting dressed she notices a lot of blood in the sheets, no clue where in came from. We look at each other for wounds or something but there’s nothing. We leave the room and her roommate is giving me a bad look and later I find out it’s because her dog ate some of my puke. Anyways, I go with her to work, because my place is very close to work so we leave in the same subway station, we say good bye and I head home.

On the way home I start feeling uncomfortable and something is hurting down there... oh no.. could this be where the blood came from? I rush home and go pee. When I start peeing I feel the burn of all that processed tequila coming out boiling my dick!! I say wtf, when I look down there a HUGE CUT from the tip of my dick to the middle. To this day I have no idea how... don’t ask me for details, it’s lost in my mind.

I start panicking and sent a picture to my friend who is a doctor and she laughs a lot and tells me it’s going to be fine, but would take a while to heal. I told the girl from the party about it and said I’d pay for the dry cleaning because it was my dick blood, she laughs even more and says it’s ok.

On the bright side we started dating for real and took three months before we had sex for the first time, and we are together until this day.

My dick has healed fine and there is no scar or loss of sensitivity if you were wondering that, took almost a week to not feel pain while peeing, this was the worst part!

Edit: Now when somebody asks how we met each other we just say “from work” and sudden war flashbacks from this day comes to mind.

I was a virgin (she wasn't), and we ""courted"" a la the Christian anti-dating book ""I Kissed Dating Goodbye"". We occasionally kissed, but we didn't have any other sexual contact before our wedding night. We did get really close once or twice. I was the one that pulled away in those moments, telling her it would be better when we got married if we waited to have sex (that's what the aforementioned book had claimed, and I thought that's what God would have wanted).

  


We got married, and sex was exhilarating at first, but before the honeymoon was even over, some harsh realities hit: my wife has endometriosis, and had some deep trauma after having been in a sexually abusive relationship in High School. I knew about these issues prior to marrying, but hadn't imagined they would hamper our sexual relationship as much as they had. Sex was pretty infrequent, and was spent largely focusing on my wife and her needs, physically and emotionally. Anything other than sexually touching her and missionary intercourse was off the table for her. I read books like ""She Comes First"" by Ian Kerner to try and be a better lover to her. She became more open to cunnilingus, but still didn't want sex very often (once a month if I was lucky), and only on her terms.

  


Alright, montage time: Fast forward 7 years, I have developed a drinking problem, decide to nip it in the bud get sober (still am, almost 5 years!), leave the church and join AA. 6 months later, my in-laws have a nasty, messy divorce, and my wife has a breakdown. Shortly after this, she, too, leaves the church, and comes out as queer (the closest she can get to explaining it is some overlap between demi- and bi-sexual). She confesses that she kissed and was propositioned by a close female friend of ours. She didn't go through with it, but it hurt a lot to be...soft-core cheated on? We start couples counseling. She doesn't feel like sex is something we need to talk about in or out of a session, and any time the subject is brought up, she shuts down. Within the last two years, sex is almost non-existent. She tells me that ""sex was only something that I thought a good Christian wife was supposed to do"", which hurt me a lot. Here I was, trying to be respectful and thankful for what little we had, while she secretly didn't want that at all.

  


We've talked about the possibility of opening up our relationship for her to explore her sexuality with women, and she suggested it could be for me too, to get my needs met, but we haven't officially agreed to anything. I'm not opposed to her exploring her sexuality, but don't want to be a door mat. I'll admit that the thought of us opening up and dating again is terrifying and thrilling. I do still think monogamy can be great, but I really just want to be wanted by my partner.

  


With all this in mind, I recently had a very sobering moment. I was reading a book called ""The 7 Principals for Making Marraige Work"", and it asked a question along the lines of whether or not you would do it all over again with your spouse, knowing what you know now. I couldn't answer. And if I couldn't answer yes, then my answer was actually no. And that really freaked me out.

  


I know that as a relationship matures, love is more often a choice you make, rather than a feeling that sweeps you up. I don't want a divorce. I still try to love my wife. I really have never stopped loving her, but her romantic disinterest is really affecting deep parts of me, and I don't know what to do.

  


Looking for any advice, perspectives, insights, or personal experiences you may have with handling personalities and/or individual needs changing in a marriage.

  


**TL;DR -** Wife and I married while devout Christians, then both left the church, but seemingly in different directions. Feeling lost and wrestling with what our marriage is now.

First off, I'm not kinkshaming my SO or anyone else who likes this stuff!
What you like is what you like, there's no shame in that!
With that being said, my SO is into some kinky stuff.
Bondage, BDSM, latex, chastity, being dominated, it's the only way they can get sexual relief.
The thing is, I am completely not into that but have tried to please them regardless since I'm kindof a people pleaser.
I have a coach helping me with mental stuff, which also happens to include setting boundaries for myself.
My SO and I have been together for almost 3 years now.

Here's what happened (all through discord chat bc that's how we usually communicated):

I confessed to my SO that I really didn't like the aforementioned kinks, and that I'd no longer want to provide their satisfaction regarding these kinks.
SO then gets upset because they feel lied to, and proceeds to call me a manipulator, claims she's been lied to and wants compromises (other lesser kinks that I sadly don't want to take part in either).
They even claimed they felt worthless because of the statement, even though I repeatedly told them they were not worthless at all.

They later calmed down, and I could sense that they tried to say things to make me stay with them, such as not needing the kink and how they'll be obedient.
A year back they tried the same thing when I was visibly disturbed about some other kink I didn't like to take part in at all, so I transferred ownership of our server to them and left the server (it was a private server with channels and such for music bots and such).
I needed to collect my thoughts, and eventually asked a good friend for advice who suggested this subreddit.

Now I am here, essentially stuck between two choices.
I can either leave them and think about myself first in what feels has been years, or I can stay with them and try to please them.
I feel both choices are wrong, I don't want to see them sad but I also don't want to bend myself yet again to something I thoroughly do not enjoy.

What do I do?

Okay, you probably find these things abnormal and repulsive, but every kink and fetish is about something ""different"", what the majority of people find scary, weird or disgusting, that's why they are called kinks or fetishes. So you are not alone if you think these are disgusting and you never want to try them, and that's okay.

Her pediatrician reccomended Pedia-lax (stool softener for kids) make the job easier when the time came. So 2 days of OTC Pedia-lax and still no poop. 

Then comes day 3. Everything is normal and on schedule. Nothing out of the ordinary. Potty time comes and Twin A is in and out in about 5 minutes. Twin B's turn. She seemed tense. Like more tense than usual. She holds the potty seat on the toilet and locks her knees together. She's clenching. So to help the process, I hold her legs up so she has no way of clenching. She's getting upset and angry. I try to tell her to just let it go. 

Then I smell it. I pick her up and there it is. The largest poo I have ever seen in my entire life. I was shook. I clean Twin B up and get her settled in the playroom. Then make my way back to the impossibly gargantuan poo my little princess dropped off. I didn't know what to do. If I flushed it the toilet would definitely clog.

Well, that's not gonna work because not only is it long and poking out of the toilet water like a choco crocodile but it also has some girth to it. I'm freaking out at this moment because I know what I have to do. I grab an old steak knife that no one loves and attempt to cut the poo log into smaller ""poolettes"". 

It's like clay. The smell is horrid. I start dry heaving. My 2 sons and husband are all laughing hysterically. This is hell. I'm in hell. I get it down to about 4 slices and toss the newly dubbed ""poop knife"" in the trash. Then, with plunger in hand, I flush. It went down no problem and now I am 100% invested in helping Twin B have a regular poo schedule.

I am traumatized.
Never again.

TL;DR:

To avoid clogging a toilet I chopped a record breaking log of poo (courtesy of my 3 yr old daughter) in to 4 pieces with a steak knife. Which I quickly found out was my worse nightmare.

I've tried to be sexy, but when I try he.. Laughs.. Like I'm just a cute bean... Its really off putting.. I suggested buying toys but he doesn't want to buy a $80 dildo (a body safe and good sized one) and he's usually too tired to try and ""help me"". I can literally jerk off, naked, next to him and he'd prefer playing the game. 

It's causing my self esteem to go quite a bit, and I've told him, I've told how I don't even wanna try to be sexy anymore because it just feels.. Embarrassing.. Especially when he laughs or he's I look good and then do absolutely nothing. 

Now even when we do have sex I just get really put off, hell tell me how sexy I am and I just feel like he's lying. Or I remember when I tried actually being sexy he didn't care.. He'll say how much he loves having sex and I just want to call him a liar because he obviously finds it a chore. I don't know. Its really messing with my head space, self esteem and confidence. 

I just wanna know, is it a me thing? Do I need to work on myself? Is it him thing? Relationship thing?

Earlier in the day, I was manscaping because it was about time, I used the razor for the groin and scissors for delicates. I ended up nicking my nutsack. I checked to see the damage and came to the conclusion that it was only a little cut that would clot up quickly and that'd be that. Nope!

I had to go to work later in the day so I changed and left. After a while, I was thinking that felt wet beneath the belt. Part of my work includes physical labor outside so I just wrote it off as sweat on my freshly trimmed balls. It wasn't until I got home to change did I realize I had a bloody pair boxers!

I (19) came out of my room at 2pm and hear moaning a couple rooms over. I didn't say anything but I felt sick because I knew it was my dad and his gf (I hate his gf more than anyone I know)
I didn't say anything but after it happened 3 more times all in the middle of the day for the next 2 weeks I politely talked to him about and said I didn't want to hear that. Especially in the morning or lunch time when I'm trying to eat.
He simply said ""okay, won't happen again... BUT YOU BETTER DO YOUR CHORES""
...okay then

Weeks go by and I started hearing the moaning 3x a week minimum feels like every other day. After he said it won't happen again.
And keep in mind you could hear it by opening the front door
When I bring it up again I'm pissed already. He then says ""oh forgive me for having an intimate moment with my girlfriend!"" And to that I say yeah fucking right... Cause they argue every time they're in the same room with each other. So good relationship my ass.
He then proceeds to say this would happen in any given household. So I asked my mom if this happens at her house... She said no. I confirmed with my brother.
I asked my best friends and they all said no and that they would say something.

He also mentioned that I've never had a problem with it before. And that's because it's never happened before...

So his arument and reasoning is out the window. And now I'm being told if I don't like it, I'm a sensitive bitch and I need to get out.

So am I the asshole? 
This has been causing me alot of stress lately on top of other things so feedback is much appreciated

Update: because we argued instead of taking $400 for rent he took $540
Update update: it's been a couple days now and he's acting like nothing's wrong as If i cooled off... I knew this would happen cause he does this with his gf all the time. they would yell loudly and call each other names but the next day they are perfectly fine.
I don't want this to happen with me because it's avoiding the actual problem.
 To anyone telling me to just leave. Yeah that's why I'm here asking the questions.
I feel like he doesn't actualy want me to leave and obviously loves me but refuses to give in which is why this is difficult. Considering christmas just passed every time I look at a gift he got me I cry cause I know he put effort into getting that for me.

 This happened around 2010. My girlfriend at the time had an extremely abusive mother who had been arrested a few times, her mother was alcoholic and would physically and verbally abuse my gf. My gf had been living with me for 3 years because she had moved out of her aunt's home to get away from her family. 

After the 3 years her mother had seemingly changed her ways and supposedly been going to therapy groups and gotten sober, even her family believed it. But I still hated her because of how she was and how quickly it all happened, hurting a child and abusing one can never be forgiven. So after spending a bit of time with her, my gf wanted to invite her to stay at our place for a night or two against my wishes.

While we were at work the next day, my gf's mother decided to have a few drinks, and revealed in the worst way possible that she had ""relasped"". Well while my gf was in the shower to help calm her nerves, her mother got irrate and angry with me. She started yelling about how it was my fault her ""precious child"" had been taken away from her, and actually hit me hard in the eye, so I ran to our bedroom, and locked the door. 

I knew she was gonna follow, because of her history being violent, and had a small pistol in my nightstand. I pulled out my phone and started recording, knowing what I was going to do, and I was actually happy for this moment. I yelled out the typical ""don't come in or I shoot"" and other phrases so that it would easily be deemed self defense, especially after getting hit. My gf's mother finally broke down the door and I unloaded about 4 rounds in her chest. I felt no remorse, even as my girlfriend screamed at the situation and had a full panic attack. I was so calm because it was like a dream come true, I was excited. 

Even after the emergency and cleanup services arrived, I was still secretly proud hours after all the cleanup was done. After the investigations were done, I was let off as it was immediately deemed self defense. My gf's family was in pure shock as they were fooled too. I hated that woman so much, and after about 2 years of the incident, I married my girlfriend. She still doesn't know my true feelings and intentions. I'm so glad I got to finally shoot the bitch who made my wife's childhood so miserable, and so horrible that my wife had even been hospitalized. It felt so good to actually remove the world of scum.

Let me start by giving you some background: I'm living in a country where I don't speak too well the language, I know well enough to survive here, but some specific words for some services are completely new to me and I get completely lost often. Like, I had to send my rug to dry clean, I ended up saying that I wanted to give a dry-bath on my carpet. Somehow it worked, but I learned some new words that day.

Ok, now back to the story, I hurt my back working out a few days ago. It has happened before, but this time the pain wasn't going away, so I decided to hire a masseur/masseuse to help me recover. Important to say that ""hot-massages"" are somewhat common here, but I never used that service and honestly, I thought I never would. To be sure, I looked up for a physiotherapist and I found one that was well recommended.

I got there, he was very polite, he didn't speak English, so communication was pretty much going on with google translator. He told me to take off my clothes and lay on the table, I did, keeping my bra and panties on, like all the massages I did before. He came back and asked me what was the problem and which kind of massage I wanted. I said that it could be a full body massage, but focusing on the spot that I hurt. He then told me that he was gonna take off his clothes and left the room.

My brain was like: wait, what? ok, maybe he will change for more confortable clothes. But 2 seconds later he came back and pointed to my bra and panties (important to say that he pointed for both of them) and said ""you have to remove all of your clothes"".

Then it made more sense, ok, I removed all my clothes and laid back on the table. I thought it was a little odd, but I already had masseurs/masseuses that would give me that choice so I wouldn't get oil on my underwear. I felt a little embarrassed since it was my first massage with him, but, again, I was trying to relax and don't overthink it.

He came back, started the massage and then he said something that I understood as ""Did you liked me?"" I said I didn't understand but he translated and it was ""did I confused you?"". Then I was more confused, I was able to tell him that I didn't understand and he said ""well, you're naked"".

I asked him if I did something wrong, if he wanted me to put back my panties and he said, ""no, it's ok, I just want to make sure you're confortable with this"". Well, I was, before that weird talk, but ok, he kept working on my back, all good, but when he moved to my legs, I realized he was massaging a little too close to my lady parts.

He asked again ""are you ok?"" I was already very relaxed, so I said yes, and then he touched me on my lady parts. I probably made some weird sound because he stopped and asked if I was fine and if he should continue. And then it started the weirdest google translator conversation I ever had, he asked again if it was a full body massage I wanted. I said yes, he said that if it should include the intimate zones, I think my face was so red that I probably made him feel embarrassed too, that man's face turned red so quickly that we both were just trying not to look into each others eyes while we typed on google translator.

He said that it was part of his job and it was up to me to continue or stop. I didn't want to offend him, but also, that was not what I signed for, so that was the longest 10-20 seconds of my life. I told him it was ok, but I would rather not include the intimate zones. He said ok and continue massaging my legs, but I think we were both feeling so weird that I couldn't relax much more.

We are long distance, about four hours apart, and have only met once. We've been together a year now and are starting to talk about closing the gap and marriage and such things. Since the first few months of out relationship I have known that he is asexual, likely because of his past experiences. This usually means that he feels absolutely no sexual attraction, however he does have sexual urges. We've set boundaries of course, no penetration, only foreplay.

During the one time we were together we engaged in some foreplay, but because of his history, me being a virgin and time limitations neither of us finished. We were just trying to explore each other a little. I believe during this time he started to question his sexuality a bit. This was about a month and a half ago, and since then he has started making comments about wanting everything. 

Last night he told me that before we met again he wanted to take a performance enchantment drug usually used by older men, so that if  he gets nervous while having us time he won't have to stop. Immediately I was against this idea. To me it feels as if he is trying to force his body to do things that it does not want to do, and thus making our experience together too similar to those bad experiences he's had in the past. I explained that I don't want him to continue if he isn't fully enjoying what is happening and that this isn't something we should just try to push through. I also expressed that I am worried that if I allow him to do this he will unconsciously resent me for going along with it even if it is his idea.

He expressed to me that he really felt like he just needed to push through it, get it over with and prove to himself that it isn't all bad. It was mentioned that I've never had a fear like this and wouldn't know how to handle it, and that is true, but it felt very wrong to me. He told me that if we don't do it this way then we likely won't ever have us time and even though that is perfectly fine with me, it isn't with him. He told me he couldn't see why I would think he would resent me for it, and halfway through the conversation he cut out and would not talk about it anymore. I knew better than ask if he needed space, so instead I asked if he wanted to talk about other things.

We talked for awhile after that, until it was very apparent to me that he was having a panic attack. When I told him that he seemed to be panicking and tried to help him calm down things got heated again. He told me that I was babying him, treating him like he was broken and that I needed to stop. Things calmed down again, but I'm at a loss. I have no idea how to help him, and I doubt that if I brought the subject up again so soon that he would talk about it.

 My current GF of 2 months and I have started fucking recently, and we're both a bit insatiable, still on the few times a day phase.

We spent most of our relationship hanging alone in my place, but my GFs parents are sweethearts and love being with their daughter and don't mind me one bit, so we're spending a few days here. 

I know how important it is to be a good guest so I always try to make the perfect impression, cooking a few meals, helping with the dishes, taking part in small talk, reinforcing the parent's self confidence, all the good stuff.

The house is tiny and carries sound too well so our sex life is a former tinder to great roaring flame it once was.

Our master plan was to sneak in to the basement to fuck while watching TV loudly. We got away with it twice, the second time we got interrupted by the mom calling us for some snacks but we managed to finish. The third time, which was the next day, the dad came down to watch some stupid shit on TV, my man it's your house you do what you want, but get the message when your panting red faced daughter is cuddling with her BF under a blanket.

Idk what he thought we were doing but sex wasn't on his mind and he just plopped down beside us and offered us popcorn.

 As we shuffled inconspicuously under the blanket, I reached out and popped a popcorn in my mouth, extra buttery goodness filled my taste buds, all was forgiven.

But there was a problem, I'm a horny bastard.

I've only been in here for a few days and there were just a few more to go. I'm not a sex starved animal, but suddenly cutting me off made me a bit horny for a self handy.

 So here I am in the guest toilet, just trying to rub one out while watching some good old-fashioned Reddit porn with my volume all the way down. I double check to make sure all wireless audio outputs are off as to not embarrass my self.

 As I'm about to reach the apex to some good shit I found, my entire body flexes involuntarily, and I push back in to the toilet of the guest bathroom.

It was man against bowl, a force of nature against the white porcelain of comfort, a large mass against a shitty contractor's bang up job.

 Who would win?

It wasn't the toilet. The water tank somehow came clean off lodged itself partially in to the back wall as it emptied it's contents all over the floor. 

#**tl;dr**

No way I'm flushing myself out of this one.



* **Edit 1:** Cleaned up the bathroom, spoke to my dad's contractor buddy, he's coming over tomorrow with a new toilet and wall stuff to help me out. I did it so I guess it's my responsibility to take care if it (not a pun).

 I'm making them a steak dinner, some chocolate chip scones and hot chocolate for desert. I'm gonna break it to them after. 
I thought about surprising them with a fixed bathroom tomorrow, but it'd be strange if another strange man from a strange land came and messed with their family's plumbing.

* **Edit 2:** Bathroom is fixed contractor bud didn't charge me a cent. Gotta get him a pack of beer.

this happened a few months ago but I thought it would be good to put here

context: my school is fully remote. I'm not exactly having the most fun at home, either. 

ok, lets get into the juicy shit. so it was towards the end of the day, and i was getting tired, not to mention I had a shitty day (and week). Now, for some reason my percussion class brought up the topic of 2020 (this was in like November of last year) and of course covid came up. for some dumb reason, my teacher said something like ""well at least  we're all still alive"". So of course, my dumbass said ""speak for yourselves"". Why did i say this? no fucking clue. I have no idea why I thought this would go over well or they would be able to tell it was a joke, especially since they couldn't see my facial expression since my camera was off (not that that would have made it any better). My teacher asked me ""what do you mean by that?"" and that was when I realized what I just said. I desperately tried to play it off and make it obvious that it was a joke. Sadly, my attempt failed. Finally after what felt like the longest hour of my life, class ended. I though I was off the hook. Boy, was I wrong. 

A couple days later I was at a special lunch for students who were new to the school last year, lead by the dean of my grade. It was pretty boring, but whatever. I was about to leave when the dean said ""(my name), can you stay back for a minute?"" My brain started going through everything I had ever done and said in my entire existence, but the incident in percussion a few days ago didn't even pass my mind. Unfortunately, that's what she wanted to talk to me about. my teacher reported my dumb joke to the fucking dean. THE DEAN. It ended up being fine, she just wanted to make sure I was ok, which of course I lied about and said I was fine. But that's not it. 

About a week later, a school counselor emailed me about setting up a meeting. I wasn't worried about it, since she made it clear it was just supposed to be a regular check in. So i went to the virtual meeting, she asked me about my home life, how I'm balancing school and mental health, all that stuff. Then she brings up the joke that I had completely forgot about. Turns out Mr. Can't Take A Joke emailed both the dean and the school counselor. I had to explain to her (AGAIN) that it was a stupid joke and I didn't mean anything by it.

I hate that I can't even go without a cell phone or some sort of connection to the outside world without 99% of the people, friends included acting like I'm some sort of jerk just because I don't want to be up Mark Zuckerberg's ass or down with circlejerking the overlord firms that have us constantly sucked into every type of social media platform whether it be tik tok or YouTube. 

I'm sick of every day if you don't follow 300 different influences you are the pariah of society. Do all of those things necessarily apply to me personally? No.

 But I see others weighed down by it constantly and it sucks. and people all around vibing with this toxic af nurturing of societal pressures they insist they can't live without is ridiculous. 

On their profiles they'll insist they love nature more than technology and they're ""disconnecting from society"" although their $5000 Nikon with Bluetooth and wifi built in and their 700 Instagram photos of them slurping up a starschmucks vente fucking Frappuccino proves otherwise. 

I hate the fact that some of the leading causes of pollution destroying our planet is in fact the industrial plants used to create the materials and chemicals needed for integrated circuits and circuit boards and LCD screens and yet even the protestors go home at the end of the day to a house full of frapple TVs and unnecessarily powerful computers of which they will never even use 10% of their capabilities other than running a fucking bench test to make sure it can handle the next up and coming video game that just keeps us glued to our wall sockets and microwave radiation that we hail every time we shove our wireless buds in our ear balls so we can suck up every repetitive note of the next algorithmic inspired pop song.


Rant...over. for now.


Edit: don't get me wrong. I love how helpful technology can be and I wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for medical technology or cell phones, and I'm glad that technology helps less fortunate people get an education and further developing minds. I just don't like the direction it is headed or what it has become.

When we were together I saw he had a dating app on his phone. He told me he forgot to delete it and then deleted it. I had told, someone I trusted, a few months ago about how when I got with him I was still in love with my ex who left no due to our relationship. It was for the first three months but those feelings went away. I told my partner I still stay in touch with him but I knew he didn't like it very much. Well, that got back to him and he was mad so I told him a few other things that I had been keeping from him, like that my other abusive ex had called me and I talked to him a bit before telling him to eff off. There was also that a friend of mine admitted he was in love with me but I didn't feel like that at all towards him. Anyways, now to the present. He was showing me something on his phone when he went to the search thing on his phone and one of the siri suggested apps was the same dating app he had deleted before. He said he redownloaded it during our ""fight"" (really when we broke up). I had told him that he could tell me if he wanted to see other people but I understand that can be a tough conversation. I realized on my way to work that those apps typically don't show up unless you've used them recently. I called him and talked to him about it and he admitted he talked to people when he went home for vacation (which he got back very early this year) but said he never sent any nudes, much less slept with anyone. I told him that I didn't like being lied to and he brought up the stuff I had kept from him. I had thought we had resolved that but I can be the same way and hold on to stuff. It really hurt and I want to trust him. I told him to show me the app when I came over tomorrow, which I admit is probably too far, and he got upset at me and said he didn't have to show me anything.

We were polyamorous but needed consent from each other to do anything with anyone else. 
One day we pretty much went to me and went “we’re having sex with our friend, E, tomorrow. It doesn’t matter if you join or not but planned for you too. Either way, I’m sleeping with him.” 

I didn’t want either C or myself to sleep with E. I tried telling C this but he really wouldn’t listen, so pretty much he gave me some alcohol the next day to calm my nerves, was telling me how badly he wanted to do this, and how he expected me to be okay with it and it was sad that I wasn’t. He said I was controlling. We had sex with E.  It was good sex, just something I felt pressured into doing. E didn’t know I was pressured, he thought I was consenting to ALL of this and had known about it for several days. 

Months go by and another situation similar to this happens with our friend, T. T didn’t know I was pressured into the threesome and that I was afraid to say no because I didn’t want C to leave me. 
It became a regular thing for me, C, and T to have sex with each other, I was now consenting to this very openly unlike the first time it happened. 

This was all almost a year ago, I left C because he was a manipulative controlling dumbass. Me, E, and T are VERY close. 
We had an emotional talk the other night and I told them that in the beginning, I was slightly intoxicated and pressured into having sex with the them. They had thought I was sober and enthusiastically consenting to the whole thing. I don’t blame them at all, they didn’t know. If anything, I feel bad for lying to them/letting them believe untrue things. 

T and E both feel very very guilty, T even cried. They both basically keep saying they should have known and are sad, I think they honestly are starting to think that r@ped me, which they didn’t at all! 

How do I explain to them that they aren’t at fault at all? That I’ve never blamed them, only my ex and myself?

We had a six AM flight out of Los Angeles and the only ride we could get from a friend was at around 11 or 12 the night before. On the way there my best friend produced some fancy marijuana chocolate bars (of the premium and high potency variety) — the both of us ate a half of one or so. Maybe a little more. I don’t know how well informed you are about premium marijuana chocolate, dear reader, but you’re only supposed to have about one fucking Hershey square lest you wish to have your soul forcibly removed from your body by Satan, and then dangled in front of you like a carrot on a string that it feels like you’ll never catch again. Otherwise, maybe you just know how to handle your shit. Idk. 

So, we get into the terminal and I find the little kiosk thingy to check in to the flight. I pop my name in that sucker get our boarding passes, and with good timing as I completely forget who I am or how i happened my way into this particular material plane of existence no less that 5 seconds afterwards. Blink. I’m splashing water on my face in the bathroom trying to pep talk myself into remembering who I am, how badass I am... trying to talk my ego out of completely fucking off for the night. Blink. I’m scrolling through Instagram on my phone and nervously eyeballing security cameras in the terminal, absolutely certain that they are somehow scanning my body for its THC content and automatically notifying the SWAT team. Blink. I wake up and there’s a woman who doesn’t speak English asking me for something. After as many caveman grunts, tears and hand gestures I can manage, I offer her my iPhone charger which she happily leaves with, never to return. 

And then the kicker: after I manage to coax myself out of a panic attack and try to sleep for a couple of hours before security opens, I wake up with a HOMELESS WOMAN ON TOP OF ME TRYING TO UNZIP MY PANTS. My best friend later said that he saw her climb on me, and try to ostensibly do the do with me, but he couldn’t get himself to say anything because he was so fucking high he’d forgotten how to talk. Thankfully, she wasn’t able to wrestle anything out of any fabric containers before I was able to shove her off of me and move on to another terminal to nap in, but I think I’ll refrain from ever eating massive amounts of edibles in a publicly accessible space again. :)

Throwaway for obvious reasons. Also I’m on mobile so sorry for any formatting issues 

TLDR: perfect relationship with partner but I’m not sexually satisfied. 


So I’ve been dating my partner for over two years now and we met over bumble and it’s mostly been great. Of course we have had our ups and downs over the span of our relationship but through each hurdle, I’ve found myself to be even more in love with him. We are both very open with each other and he’s so respectful of me and in general is just an amazing person. Like seriously I could marry this guy today.

The issue that I’m having now is the fact that our bedroom is so boring. Like so vanilla sex and I’m just not that type of gal. I desire extreme sexual intimacy so lots of touching, eye contact, passionate foreplay, maybe even some kink! Basically I would like him to be so excited to see me naked that a primal reaction comes out of him. Lols. At first I thought maybe he is just nervous around me and it’ll get better when we’re more comfortable around each other— long story short, he’s not.

We RARELY have sex. And I mean rarely. Maybe once a month at the most. He often doesn’t care if I’m naked or not, there’s very little foreplay (no going down on me either) and honestly it’s affecting me more than I would like it to. The only time we passionately make out is when we do have sex. It’s to the point where I question his love for me and even his sexuality. 

I don’t necessarily want to break up with him over this but I’m young still and I want an exciting sex life. I would really like it to be with him. To be honest, I’m fearful that I won’t find anyone better than him in terms of emotional chemistry. Like truly we are best friends and I love him dearly. I just wish our sex life was more exciting. 

Has anyone else gone through this with a partner? How did you guys overcome this hurdle? Or did you end up having to break it off cuz there was so sexual satisfaction ?

My boyfriend (M) and I (F) are both in our twenties and have an issue that I’m sure a lot of people have: I want to have sex as often as possible, but my boyfriend can’t get aroused regularly due to a low sex drive. The issue is made a little more complex due to the physiological and psychological aspects that lead to this; my [hypersexuality](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/compulsive-sexual-behavior/symptoms-causes/syc-20360434) makes me crave sex over and over throughout the day, but he has a low drive and can only get physically aroused twice a week at best. He’s often psychologically aroused and is happy to help me whenever I ask, though there’s a significant difference between what he can do and what I want/need when he can’t “get it up.”

My big issue is that I can no longer afford the therapy that was helping me manage it, and I am now on a medication that worsens the hypersexuality symptoms. I cannot stop taking this medicine as it’s the only thing that has successfully helped me manage my paranoia, hallucinations, and delusions due to schizoaffective disorder, so I need to live with these side effects. 

My boyfriend and I have talked about this before, even in recent times, but we can’t seem to meet each other halfway; he has no insurance to see a doctor (I’m genuinely worried about him and want him to get a hormone panel due to other issues), and I can’t turn my hypersexuality off. I’ve been really good about taking care of my own urges whenever possible and respecting his “no,” but it’s starting to wear on me since my needs aren’t being met. Nowadays we’re averaging only once every week to two weeks... if I’m not mistaken, that’s pretty low for even for a standard couple in their twenties. 

I love him so incredibly much, he spoils me rotten, he’s the sweetest person I’ve ever met, and I can genuinely see myself marrying him if this issue gets resolved. I’m happy to meet him halfway, but how do I bring up this topic in a polite way that stresses how much this affects me?

I'll be honest, looking back, quite a few of them are lude, and younger me definitely jerked to them. One day one of my friends is over and sees my phone when i'm showing them a meme, they see the collection and demand to know what it is. I tell them and they demanded to take a picture of it at the threat of them telling the people in it. I was scared so i obliged and didn't think much of it, I figured he thought what i did was embarrassing/funny since he wasn't very interested in the actual pictures.

Fast forward a few years, I have long since stopped saving them for various reasons. I honestly completely forgot i ever had saved pictures of people at all. I somewhat recently started getting texts from all of these girls that my collection was disgusting, fucked up, objectifying, deplorable, that I was a creep, pervert, misogynist,  who betrayed their trust. I felt so sick. This friend and I had long since had a falling out so I guess his way of getting back was letting every girl I knew in HS that I jerked off to that i jerked off to them. 

Am i actually an asshole? I sure have a lot of people telling me i am. They made it a mission to let EACH person on there know I wanked to them and I've lost so many friends because of this. I honestly never considered if it was wrong to enjoy pictures that people posted, I always thought it was just kind of normal to get off to people you knew, especially when you're young (high school)and still figuring everything out. It's not like they were nudes or private photos, they were mostly just thirst traps or people hyping themselves up i guess. 

On the other hand I can see where they are coming from. I have no clue what it's like to find out someone has got off to you, especially if it's someone close/you know. I can understand how that might be uncomfortable. But it's not like i ever intended to tell them.

I have been put off responding to any of the girls for a while because I firstly don't know how, and secondly don't really agree that what I did was so awful. But maybe it was and I need to accept that I did something shitty in HS and move on. I just need peace and I feel like these people deserve an answer.

In November I go to a tinder dates apartment to hookup but we end up clicking like two bestfriends who have known eachother for 10 years. We click so much in fact that I spend the next 3 days with this girl in her apartment (I went back home for extra clothes in between). 
We basically vibe on every level aside from a few things such as her wanting to persue a poly relationship, which I have never tried. Basically shes almost to tee exactly what I want out of a potential partner.
Even after I go home we text constantly and she calls me all the time. Our calls can go for hours and I just feel like I've found my next girlfriend. 

However, she starts to realize that I'm really looking for this to go somewhere after I keep asking if it's going somewhere. She expresses to me that she just got out of a abusive relationship and she doesnt feel ready for something new nor does she want something new. Says she would love to stay friends (with benefits) and continue to be as close as we are. I agree to this and we continue seeing eachother with each time we do being several days together. 
I eventually find some good reasons we shouldn't even consider dating anyway such as her feeling like she can only feel romantic attraction to women, wanting something poly, and to top it off wanting to move to Spain in a few months. 
So I try to stay her bestfriend and this works for a while. Even to the point where she suggests we live together until she leaves for spain because one of her several roommates drive her crazy and she knows I need a place to live asap. 
I feel great, I have a new friend who I adore and I get to have some pretty great sex with them (the best either of us have had in fact). What could go wrong? 

Heres where it goes wrong. 
So this month of December she goes on vacation with her family (during a pandemic, I know and she knows its absolutely stupid). While shes in Florida she has a threesome and then continues to sleep with the man from the threesome for the remainder of the trip. So for like a entire week my stomach is a pit. Saint that she is shes happy to talk about my feelings of jealousy even after she gets back. I  voiced that it just made me feel replaceable or like I wasnt special to her somehow. I wanted to know I had value beyond sex to her, that I had something this man couldnt also provide. Also sitting at home on your pc while your crush gets railed doesnt exactly feel great.
She made me feel better about these things and assured me that I'm one of her bestfriends shes ever had and that I'm absolutely not replaceable to her. 
However, my jealousy has made her not wanna move in together anymore which stung a lot. Especially since I was never nasty or toxic with my jealousy, I didnt wanna control her I just wanted to talk it out with her. 

Even when shes back I dont get a total reprieve from jealousy because one of her roommates wanna sleep with my friend. My friend also wants to sleep with that roommate given the chance. Hasnt happened yet but this girl will be flirtatious every now and again towards my friend, even in front of me or will do things like sit between me and my friend. So I have to deal with the constant feeling like that could happen anytime and they very much both plan to have it happen soon (shes told me so). So I assume that'll have happened by the next time I see her. 

After a few days of being back in town and a negative covid test we finally get to see eachother again. We've spent new years together and I've really enjoyed my time with her. Shes telling me how much shes missed me and is super affectionate. 

However, I know that I'll have to deal with my jealousy again at some point. Shes a highly sexual person and she doesnt turn down advances when they come her way. 
I just wanna be able to be her friend who can high five her for getting laid rather than get uncomfortable but I dont know how to kill these lingering feelings. 
In the past with any FWB scenario I've been able to just turn off catching feelings if I know they arent allowed to mix with my interactions with the person. I dont know why I cant do that here. But I shall get no breaks because even this morning she mentioned wanting tinder again. 

I know this story isnt very coherent but I'd appreciate any advice provided. Just wanna preemptively say I am not willing to drop her as a friend lol. But any advice beyond that is definitely appreciated. 

TLDR:
My hookup from tinder became my bestfriend (with benefits) but I still caught feelings for her that I logically know I shouldn't have for her because we wouldn't work together. Yet I'm still getting jealous when she has encounters with other people and idk how to get rid of those lingering feelings causing my jealousy.

I met this guy on a dating app about 1.5-2 years ago, went for a date with him and it was fine, decent enough to go on a second. I was admittedly quite flirty on text prior to the second date - suggestion of me going down on him, which was because I was single and horny and I don’t know I was in a weird part of my life then. Anyway, I end up going to his house to watch a movie and eat pizza for the second date. He’s not particularly engaging and I end up getting into his bed (fully clothed) to watch a movie with him. Anyway, things get heated and we end up kissing, and then I’m naked. This is where I don’t know if it’s just regret or not - I’m sitting on top of him, naked, kissing him. Suddenly, without any warning, he’s inside me, without any sort of protection. I’m taken aback but within about 5 thrusts he finishes inside me so I didn’t really have time to register what happened. He then asks if I’m on anything (thank god I was) and then spent the rest of the ‘date’ watching the movie/sleeping as I’m lying there confused, used and feeling a bit shit about myself. Not that it’s important but as soon as he was done he was done with me, nothing else really, didn’t show any further affection. I left shortly after, didn’t speak to him again (he did text me asking to hang out after work but I shot him down saying I didn’t want sex and I knew that’s all he wanted). 

I don’t think it was rape, but I’ve always felt a bit disgusting about how it happened because he just fucked me without any warning or any protection (I did get myself tested afterwards).

Would it be shitty of me to not mention that I'm a sexual abuse survivor when explaining my boundaries?

I (28F) just started seeing someone new (30M). Let's call him Brian. We met about a month ago. I really like him so far. He's kind, smart, funny, dresses well, has a steady job, and we have so many common interests. The relationship hasn't gotten sexual yet for a few reasons. One of those reasons is that I have sexual boundaries that I feel need to be discussed beforehand. One of those boundaries is ""absolutely no anal under any circumstances"". It's a major trigger to me because my abusive ex-boyfriend did something horrible to me. But beyond being a trigger, it's also physically dangerous for me. Because of what my ex did to me, I needed multiple surgeries and various other medical procedures. Any kind of anal penetration could cause the most serious surgery I had to fail, which would be an absolute nightmare. I've had a bunch of surgeries throughout my lifetime and that one was by far the most brutal. The concept of going back to dealing with excruciatingly painful flare-ups followed by going through that horrible surgery all over again is absolutely terrifying to me.

So, I obviously need to have this conversation with Brian before we decide to take that next step. However, I'm unsure of whether or not I should tell him why I set my boundaries. On the one hand, I think it's important to be open and honest. On the other hand, I feel like if someone has sexual boundaries, their partner should respect that no matter what. It shouldn't matter why. I kind of want to see how he reacts to essentially being told ""You cannot do this thing to me because I'm uncomfortable with it"" (I'm not actually going to word it like that, don't come at me please). It's important to me that the man I'm with respects my boundaries because he respects me, not because he's afraid of forcing me to have another surgery and potentially facing legal consequences for that. I recognize that I said earlier that I really like Brian and think he's awesome, and you would think based on everything I said that I should just trust that he'd be respectful. But...I can't do that yet. I know from experience that some men are really, really good at pretending to be kind and caring. Nobody gets my full trust super early on anymore. I can't take that risk. Nothing personal to Brian.

My one friend told me that she thinks that it would be unfair for me to test Brian when he's been nothing but fantastic so far. But is testing someone in the infancy of a relationship necessarily a horrible thing in absolutely all circumstances? I personally don't think so, but I'm open to hearing from people who disagree with me on that. I absolutely intend on telling him the full extent of what happened to me at some point (provided we become official), this isn't some deep dark secret, I'm just trying to figure out how to handle this at the present time. So, if you were me, what would you do here?

Me and my ex had a pretty good communication about the things we were interested in sexually. We were both pretty new to that world and, in turn, pretty vanilla. Regardless we still enjoyed it, and it was a healthy enough space where laughing and giggling wasn’t uncommon when silly things happened. 

She would joke about a lot of things outside of the bedroom, like the idea of choking and butt stuff, but when seriously confronted we both admitted we weren’t about it (ironically im into choking now but hey😅). One time she says she’s gonna start referring to me as daddy, to which I say “nah I never understood why people like that, it lowkey makes cringe”. Her hearing this, she now begins to randomly call my daddy sarcastically because she finds my reaction hilarious. Soon enough she brings it to the bedroom and jokingly calls me it in the midst of sexy time, giggling the whole time. 

After this goes on for some months, we’re chilling in our living room, I ask her to pass me the remote, she says “sure thing daddy” and I’m instantly at attention. My eyes widen after realizing what incited this. I say nothing and observe the next few times she says it and sure as shit, like clockwork my little worker gets up and ready to go to the office.

I'll try to keep it brief, but i'm pretty wordy.

**Trigger warning for discussions of self harm, suicidal thoughts, cults, abuse, and sexual abuse/grooming beyond this point.**

From the ages 6-10, my mother was dragged into a cult and took me along with her. Even from an early age I wasn't buying any of the things they were selling. I mean, who could blame me? I had to leave my friends, my cat, and my otherwise normal life behind to go live on a school bus with a bunch of musty hippies telling me how I needed to worship a bunch of indian gods I knew absolutely nothing about. 

As one could expect, I was sort of the black sheep of the group. The cult leader always targeted me, told me how I was possessed by demons and how I was going to hell for all the things a normal kid would do. Whenever he gave lectures he'd sometimes specifically make lectures centered around my own flaws, using me as an example of what not to be. 

The only reason we left the cult was because I eventually stood up for myself, and as a result was threatened to be given up for adoption by the cult leader. My mom refused, and we were banned from ever associating with them again.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to age 11, in a new town trying to have a normal life. I've still pretty fucked up from my undoubtedly shitty childhood, and just now getting accustomed to society after having been isolated from it for so long. Still, I proved that I wasn't a bad person to the cult leader, and thought I'd proved everything he said about me wrong.

Then I entered public school again, after having been taken out of it for years. The last time I was in school was in 1st grade, and now I was in 6th. I didn't fit in, and the kids made it evident. I was bullied by literally my entire grade, and truth be told I honestly don't blame them now. When I was getting into the internet I started becoming obsessed with creepypasta and was basically trying to act like jeff the killer all the time. 

But back then, I didn't understand what was wrong with me. And it felt like all those things that the cult leader had said about me being an awful person were right.

&amp;#x200B;

Age 12, 7th grade, and I moved back to the town I lived in at age 6. I start going to a new school, make a new friend who I get really close to. However, this is also the time that my underlying mental illnesses are beginning to take form. I have anxiety attacks on a regular basis. My emotions control me more than I control them. I get baker acted since the principal didn't know what else to do with me, and am forced to stay in a psych ward against my will for two weeks. Nobody knows what's wrong with me, especially my mom. After being baker acted I drop out of middle school.

Over the summer, I become even closer friends with that friend from middle school. We hang out as much as we can, doing basically everything together. At one point, they even told me that they'd take a bullet for me. I said I'd do the same.

I go back into school at age 14, this time a freshman in a small ""alternative"" high school. My mental issues are really starting to get the best of me. My anxiety attacks occur more often, and I'm in a deep state of depression. I start hearing a voice in my head, saying that he's a guardian angel and I become obsessive over him. Someone from one of my classes spreads to the whole school that I'm schizophrenic (something that was evidently somewhat correct). I dump all my feelings onto my best friend, and eventually they can't take it anymore and snap. They never talk to me again. Can't say I blame them, I regret what I did a lot.

I get a psych eval done later on in my life. I'm diagnosed with C-PTSD, generalized anxiety disorder and schizoaffective disorder. I also find out I'm on the autism spectrum.

&amp;#x200B;

After my best friend left, I start getting a huge fear of being abandoned, and as a result a desperation to make people happy. Later on, a new online friend enters my life. This friend was 18, and I was still around 14. This friend started using my own delusions against me, saying that she could channel the spirit I was supposedly hearing in my head. This friend allows the spirit to ""speak through her"". This spirit tells me that they love me. This spirit tells me they want to see me. More specifically, this spirit asks for me to send nude pictures of myself.

I sent them. I want to make this spirit happy, after all.

A few weeks afterward, the friend tells me she made it all up, and they gave me no explanation for why she asked me for nudes other than ""she wanted to"". I block her. I feel betrayed. I feel scared. 

But still, I want desperately for someone to love me.

And so I entered a whole slew of online friendships and online relationships, with them all ending the same way: me bending over backwards for them, and them always eventually leaving after one depressive episode of mine too many. It's like no matter who I meet, they start to hate me.

And I just want desperately for someone to finally love me.

(Some good news, I eventually got on anti-psychotics and the delusions I had eventually stopped.)

&amp;#x200B;

Age 16, and I meet someone online who says that they love me. He's from a different country, but that doesn't matter to me. We begin dating. He tells me on a regular basis how much I mean to him, how he wants to get married and start a family with me. At least this time, he's around my age.

He also ask me for nudes. Naturally, I send them.

He starts becoming more and more demanding in their requests, asking me to do deranged things for him that I can't even name here. I don't want to do any of these things, but I keep doing them just to make him happy. I keep hoping eventually he'll stop, that eventually I'll be able to stop. I even try to tell him no sometimes, but he keeps pestering and pestering until eventually I cave in.

Our relationship lasted a year, which is sadly the longest relationship I've ever had. 

Then one day, he decided to break up with me. No explanation besides ""I'm not ready for an LDR,"" despite having been in one for an entire year. Naturally, I'm devastated. I have a mental breakdown for weeks on end. I don't expect to live long enough to see myself become an adult. I try to stay friends with him for awhile, just in the hopes eventually he'll love me again.

But then... I start remembering all the things he did to me. And I tell his friends about what he did to me, even showed them the screenshots. His entire friend group disowns him. I disown him. And most of all, I feel disgusted for having ever done any of those things for him in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

Age 18, soon to be 19. I've made far too many toxic friends online throughout all of this to even count on my fingers and toes. They've all made the same false promises, all gave me the same false hope. I can't count how many times I've heard ""I won't leave you like the others"", or how many times they've told me that they ""can't wait to finally meet in person"". They always say the same things, and they always end things the same way: by telling me how much of an awful person I am.

And throughout all of these friendships, I bent over backwards for them. I'd apologize 10 times a day for things I didn't even do, I'd self harm whenever I felt like I'd disappointed them, and overall I was just an emotional wreck. I don't blame them for saying a lot of the things they said, given my current mental state. But it still hurts when it keeps happening. When, like I said before, it constantly brings up that childhood trauma of being told that there's something fundamentally wrong with me and I'll always be a bad person.

But now... now I'm tired of it all. I'm tired of being hurt, I'm tired of being told I'm not good enough. I don't want a relationship anymore, I don't even want friendships anymore. It's like just being mentally ill alone is enough to attach a magnet to myself that attracts abusers. 

I really, truly haven't met anyone I've felt safe around. Even with these friends and relationships I could see the red flags from the very beginning, I just got so used to them that I thought I was just being paranoid. And truth be told, if I have to keep trudging through the same shitty people over and over again... I don't want to. 

The amount of people who I've let hurt me over and over again has proven to me that I can't trust myself. So I honestly don't think finding the ""right people"" is worth it if I have to keep going through this same pain over and over again.

&amp;#x200B;

If what they've said about me being a bad person is right, then I don't care anymore.

I want to be the bad person. I'm tired of trying to make people happy.

It's about time I make myself happy, no matter how many people I turn away from me in the process.

**TL;DR: after a traumatic childhood that caused me to develop a slew of mental illnesses, I became desperate for someone to love me. As a result, I allowed myself to be dragged into dozens of manipulative or even abusive friendships/relationships, all ending horribly. And throughout all of them, I was desperate to make them happy through the bitter end. Now I don't want anyone in my life anymore, and I don't care if that makes me a bad person.**",0,0,TrueOffMyChest,t5_2yuqy,nsfw,"After spending my whole life being hurt and told I'm worthless, I became the people-pleasing pushover.

I need some serious advice here. I’ve been with my boyfriend for 4 years. We lost our virginities to each other and I love him dearly but I’ve never once reached orgasm when we’ve had sex or fooled around. The first few times, I felt bad that I couldn’t get there so I faked it, and now I’ve been faking it for 3ish years. 

Everything we do together (fingering, penetration, etc.) feels really nice and it’s pleasurable for me but I just can’t orgasm. It takes me a long time to get there when I’m by myself and I find it even harder with a partner. I can’t orgasm by penetration alone, and I think that’s the main reason I started faking it—he could so easily orgasm and I couldn’t, and I didn’t want him to think that I wasn’t enjoying our time together. We were young-ish when we first started having sex and I definitely had problems communicating what I wanted/needed to orgasm, but now it’s been so long. 

How do I handle this? I love my boyfriend very much, and he’s very kind to me and supportive of me. He’s essentially my perfect match, we’re best friends.

 so me (18M) and my gf (18F) were close friends for a few months before we started dating. we were pretty close considering i had moved to a new school and she was the first friend i made and we just talked and enjoyed each others' company alot, this slowly turned to become more and more intimate as we started talking about more intimate and sexual stuff we grew closer. then we started making out behind the school every few days all secretive and fucking around of sorts but we were still too friends, it was too intimate to call it being fwb.

 i grew feelings for her fairly quickly and i could tell she did aswell but i wasnt 100% sure if she wouldve wanted to jump into a relationship with me because she seemed to enjoy not being tied to one person in reference to how constantly she would tell me how she found other guys attractive and all (in detail) it got me jealous and annoyed me usually considering i was very into her. 

so i decided one day to just stop talking to her and distance from her to lose feelings for her which she noticed literally the first day i tried to. we were in school and we saw each other in the corridor and she called out to me and i promptly ignored her which was probably very obvious considering we're both pretty tall and just walked past her to go to the library. she followed me in to the library and kept asking me ""what's wrong"" ""why are you ignoring me"" and questions of sorts. i told her that i liked her but i wanted to lose feelings for her because i wasnt sure if she felt the same for me. she started turning immediately confrontational and loud (which gets me really anxious and nervous) and started screaming at me telling me how much she does like me and all i could think was holy fucking shit im so into her because she was being so direct and emotional and wasnt holding herself back. at that moment i felt myself falling in love with her (eventhough i was very uncomfortable and there was another person in the library tryna read a book lolol).

 fast forward few days i asked her mind being my gf and she was ecstatic and so was i. corona lockdown came around which was amazing timing. we spent the first few months happily dating and playing games together and talking late at night and sleeping on call and pretty much spending 24/7 with each other. things got serious and i was all in it for her and i could tell she was all in it for me too and i loved it. it was just us two and no one else kind of love we didnt even bother to have friends for fucks sake it was so real and down to earth it hurt to be away from each other.


 we started planning a future and telling each other we are so spending the rest of our lives with each other (lol this wasnt some first relationship so that initial love be hella intense shit no we've both been through shit relationships and gone through the ups and downs of love). something about being with her felt so comforting to me and how she was always there for me and i was always there for me it was fucking intoxicating and i couldnt imagine her not being there for me. 

fast forward few more months she cheated on me she didnt call it cheating but it was pretty obvious what it was when i read their texts. i felt her getting distant so i interrogated her a bit and she showed me their texts and it was all so painful. she told me she thought this is how it was with my best friend (who ill call S from here on) at the time who she got very jealous over and told me she felt uncomfortable with S around me and so i told her ill limit contact with S if that means she will be more comfortable and less jealous and less insecure. when i read their texts i felt a part of me dying because it completely crushed my self esteem. it wasnt some fling or hook up i could just see as a mistake and go past it was clear she liked him and she kept denying it and i told her just stop talking to this guy lets please move on. it hurt alot. this was the last thing i imagined would happen because we felt so much love with each other but where did this guy come in i just couldnt fucking understand. confusion turned to alot of anger.

 i love her and i knew she loved me so i tried to forget it and trust in her love for me. it still made me immensely insecure and unconfident about everything from there on. then she tells me outta nowhere she dpesmt want S around me anymore as she overthinks alot gets jealous and insecure easily so i got rid of S quickly and quite impulsively and told S that im doing this cuz id rather keep my gf and the future we planned and S didnt know i was going to stop talking to her but i had made my choice and it was always my gf over anyone else. no more best friend. 

fast forward few months im still trying to get over what happened and progress was slow but being made anddddd one day she starts acting more distant and numb like (veey unusual for her and a red flag) and again i interrogate her for a bit and to simplify the stupid cluster fuckery fuckfest that occured  i found out she completely lied to me about not being in touch with him the past few months and went on call with him and to apparently ""give closure"" as to why she stopped talking to him which by the way you dont need to go on call for an hour explaining shit just saying.

 it was obvious she missed him and she started acting numb around me again. tried to forgive and heal. she understood what she did and took responsibility but she didnt change. and schools open and we see each other again it was nice for awhile then S and our mutual friends approach me and we talk a bit except me and S and i didnt know my gf was watching from somewhere but apparently she was and S pulls me aside asking why i stopped talking to her and why it was so awkward i was like its just how it is and she said fine okay and thats all we conversed and how closure was deliviered in a matter of a minute and my gf witnessed all this and she had a meltdown and she insisted i let her talk to H (H is gonna be the guy she cheated on me with) and i went with it whatever makes her happy.

 it hurt me but eh it is what it is. she did so much for him but it is what it is. week passes by i still hesitate alot and overthink and get anxious and all that fancy shit. then i notice shes being VERY numb around me just no interest in anything when im involved whatsoever so i start pulling her aside a few times ask her if things are okay is she feeling okay is she sick does she need a hug and im genuinely worrying and scared what happened. one fateful wednesday i found out what happened we were supposed to meet for break but she doesnt show up and i text her and nothing so i just walk outside lowkey worried as shit but i go out and there she is on a bench very happily  with this guy and i see shes not numb at all theres all these emotions flying around and theyre just gazing deep into each others eyes she was practically eye fucking him and i walk up feeling absolutely great yknow and it takes her a minute to notice me and she goes heyyyyyy and H goes heyyyyyy sit with us and i look over at him about to grab his skull and smash it into the fucking bench and i realise a few things. she used to find him sttractive before we were a couple she would tell me how nice and brown his hair and eyes were and it would piss me off and i mean i saw it he had nice pair of golden brown eyes and why she was gazing so deep into them and i felt so envious and insecure and by comparison i had the darkest coloured eyes not even dark brown just black pits even under very bright light and the sun they were just black. i felt envious and really insecure and really anxious and so i just walked away and she kept following me telling me shes sorry. i kept walking around in circles trying to compile my thoughts together. we got into an empty class and i acted too rash and rough with her i was so angry and felt so shit but its no excuse. she kept trying to hug me and i didnt let her i kept pulling and pushing her off. shes sensitive and i shouldnt have acted how i did. i scared her and raised my voice a bit and i felt guilty for it so i told her im sorry and pulled her in to hug her.


 i felt broken after that. i didnt know what to do. later in the day she told me she liked him and i felt like i was fading and i was terrified. TW cutting. i started cutting to relieve the stress of it so i could feel something and it was a nice feeling. i couldnt take the anxiety i felt with her and how much i overthought and how i couldnt trust her and i hate it so much but i loved her so fucking much. she did nothing to fix nor change it. i felt bad getting in between them lolol. i told her i wanted to stay. she told me she was going to still be friends with him. it baffled the fuck out of me but ok then ig i just wanted to her to be happy. she wnted to lose feelings for him so she decided to do it by sharing a diary with him and writing feelings out in it. also kinda fucked with my head but what can ya do. the last few months i spent dating her were me crying to sleep almost every day because i hated who i was and i hated how much i loved her but i couldnt manage to keep her in love with me amd i was so anxious and worrying and i hated it so much and i lost so much faith and trust in her. i tried to rebuild it but i felt like she had her priorities wrong she tried to fix herself around him but forgot that i was there aswell and all she told me was ""breakup with me if you want to but im not choosing either of you"". i hated it so much because i had to live with him being around. 

i spent the last few months basically in a haze like it was a blur of me just being constantly self conscious and so fucking envious and nothing helped and i couldnt find distractions or anything to ease the anxiety thay came with it. i broke up with her mid jan and i miss her alot its so fucking weird to stop talking to someone who you talked to 24/7 for like a year straight and it all feels so lonely and im pretty sure ill go back to her at one point and i told her i needed to break up with her cuz i need the time to heal and find myself and confidence in myself again and how she didnt change or clear my doubts or comfort me she just waited and waited. she told me so many things and she kept telling me she will do anything but it all felt so forced and i know she loves me and i love her but i csnt breathe under that sort of anxiety anymore its so painful and suffocating so i did it. it felt better to not he committed to her and we talked a few times afterwards when she needed comfort i comforted her and it was honestly really nice but she said afterwards lets just completely stop talking cuz she didnt see how this will heal me or whatever and we blocked each other everywhere and now here i am. 

how do i heal. how do i stop feeling that sort of envious if i were to get back with her which i really want to.

i know her and i know that she loved me genuinely and i know the difference when its not and when it is so i have faith that she can be better but idk how to approach this",0,0,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,nsfw,i love her so much but im not sure what to do anymore,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/l4ruqw/i_love_her_so_much_but_im_not_sure_what_to_do/,promo_adult_nsfw,18.5

Just read a thread where someone commented the following: “because a child cannot consent to an adult. She may only have been a few weeks away from turning 16 but a 15 year old cannot consent to a 22 year old.”

So a 15 year old can consent to sex with another 15 year old, but not to a 16 year old? What’s the difference? How are these numbers decided on? It seems ridiculous to me to be calling 15 year olds “children who cant consent” then a few weeks later you’re suddenly a 16 year old “adult” who is free to decide for themselves. 

I was about to turn 16 when I lost my virginity to my boyfriend who’d just turned 17. It was consensual, but apparently I was never allowed to decide for myself because I was a “child”?

Suddenly he had put his finger into it and started playing around inside me there. I didn't excatly dislike it, but I signaled him to not do it and so he stopped without complaining.

He told me very cutely that I couldn't understand how amazing it is and so on, but that didn't explain it to me.

My gf (25) and I (25) have been together for 5 years. Our relationship is like a fairy tale and I can honestly say she is my best friend and she says the same about me. Our sex life is how should I say frequent and amazing. The only hiccup is that in the 5 years we’ve dated I’ve never received oral sex. I have asked, but that was probably 3-4 years ago, I remember the convo. I asked for it and she was quiet and explained her nervousness to which I said you come to me when you are ready I won’t bring this up again. This shouldn’t matter because relationships aren’t about keeping score but I go down on her every chance I get. I vocally exclaim how much I love doing it. 

It’s sad in way because for a couple who talks about everything, such a silly thing like a blowjob is so taboo. 

I guess an important piece is that I’m my gf’s first sexual partner so I GET the awkwardness but then again it’s been 5 years.

Is the only solution here to grow some balls and talk about it? I’ve hated this elephant in the room for years and just want to put it to rest. I’d be fine if she said ‘I’m never going to give you a blowjob’ but it’s the awkwardness and avoidance from both of us that frustrates me the most.

Recently, it occurred to me that this video might've just been tip-toeing around the subject of autoerotic asphyxiation (which I didn't find out about until 8th or 9th grade, meaning that I wouldn't have picked up on any hints when I first watched the video). To give you some context, this was screened in a public middle school, so I would imagine that both the teachers and the filmmakers would've been worried about parental backlash if they'd directly referred to and/or depicted masturbation, let alone masturbation combined with choking. I would also surmise that there were concerns that some kids could've taken the video as instructional rather than cautionary if they'd actually explained the mechanics of AEA.

Furthermore, is asphyxiation by itself really so enjoyable that teenagers would willingly choke themselves within an inch of their lives? At the risk of sounding callous, that just sounds like natural selection at work. I get that the lightheadedness feels good when combined with masturbation, but I can't imagine any kid being so self-destructive and so desperate for a high that they'd almost choke themselves to death without doing anything else to augment the experience.

So, TL;DR: In 7th grade, my PE teachers showed me and my classmates a video about the dangers of ""the choking game."" In retrospect, I get the feeling that this was just a PG-rated way of discouraging autoerotic asphyxiation. Is it just me?



_(EDIT)_

I've seen a few commenters cite anecdotes about kids choking each other out or hyperventilating as some sort of daredevil game, and I should clarify: the video that I saw was talking about kids who choked themselves with some sort of ligature in their bedrooms or basements, not kids who were jokingly strangling each other or hyperventilating around friends. Given that these kids were by themselves with makeshift nooses around their necks, I kind of get the impression that something else was going on aside from the so-called ""choking game.""",0,0,NoStupidQuestions,t5_2w844,nsfw,"When schools warned us about ""the choking game,"" was that just a euphemism for autoerotic asphyxiation?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/kzxm34/when_schools_warned_us_about_the_choking_game_was/,promo_adult_nsfw,22.0

She suffers from severe depression and social anxiety by the way.

After that incident she cut herself multiple times and was beating herself up for hurting me so badly, so it ended up being me being there for her more over what she did than her being there for me.

About a month ago however, she started feeling as if the relationship was too revolved around sex, and wanted to take a break from it.

So normal day at home with the homers when they decide to go out and leave me alone for an hour or two. Both parents and my sisters? Fantastic I say, have a great time. Time to nut, obviously. It’s not about whether you need to or not, it always about opportunity. Why waste one. 

So, like everyone, I have a routine. So I go up to my parents bedroom with the biggest TV in the house and start the process. Nothing too bad, just the usually denim rubs and nippy tugs.

Now, the unusual quirk I have is I like something wrapped to be around my penis that’s not just a hand. Could be a sleeve of a lovely glove or could be the generous opening of a vase. A silken scarf works well also since you can constrain and temper the grip. Any port in a storm and all that. Maybe not too unusual but that’s my process.

So anyway, in my parents room i start to move onto the second part of the phrase. I get something on my phone that I’m in the mood and stream it to the tv. I think I hear a sound from downstairs so I stop for an second, like a sniper in a enemy terrain. Shallow breaths, ears tuned. 
Probably nothing, right?

I got back to the task at hand. I begin to looking for something easy to clean that I can jam my yoke in but there’s nothing around. Nothing in my parents room that I can mess up anyway. But then I spot it. A huge, throbbing collection of DVDs.

Now, i have a pencil like penis that tapers out to a fine nib so I think...and it’s a terrible thought, but I think maybe it’ll fit in the small circular slot in the center of DVD. The sharp, circular center I might add. So still playing and fiddling on my instrument i limp over with my trousers around my ankles and try and choose the DVD that I’m going to make sweet love to.

They have a massive collection from old westerns to rom coms to Disney. But it’s gotta be one that fits with the mood. I don’t wanna stare at Paul Newman’s surly face while I’m making my signature sauce. I can’t decide. Like having hundreds of porn videos in front of you, you get overwhelmed with choice, thinking your missing by not watching them all. So I choose one at random. A Disney one. Fuck it (literally) it’ll do. I take out the DVD and jam my sword in there. Feels good. I keep going. The case of the DVD catches my eye as I finish. A house and some balloons on the front.

We’ve been together for awhile and his job is pretty demanding so I understand when he’s exhausted and doesn’t have the energy to see me.

We live separate btw

2 weeks ago I believe he made up having Lost his taste/smell symptoms so that I wouldn’t come over due to Covid. Then miraculously the next week he wanted to see me and his Covid symptoms where gone? Last night he called me to complain about how tired he was and how he planned on going home and just sleeping after work.. which is fine... but ignored me earlier in the day completely when I asked him if I could see him last night. 

I’ve been in a state of elated happiness because we’ve passed a milestone of time I’ve never passed with any of my past relationships. So I think I’ve been pretty heavy with the affection. But I realize now that maybe this milestone actually has him reconsidering our relationship. I have no idea what he’s thinking about and every time I ask him what’s on his mind, he’ll avoid talking or he’ll just talk about his work stress. 

I noticed that he retreats the more affectionate that I get.  I haven’t been paranoid about this and I don’t believe that I’ve been overbearing. I’ve been giving everything he says and does the benefit of the doubt till now. 

What is the best next step?

Talking to him has become difficult for me because I feel like I never know the right thing to say but it's also the easiest thing ever.

The plan was to live in staff housing together than after the season is over travel around the country before finally settling down to get jobs. We were both living in staff housing together until recently. My girlfriend found a new job she really wanted to do and wanted to take the opportunity. But in order to do so she would have to quit the job at the ski resort and move out of staff housing, it was a total change from our plans, but whatever I like it here and I want her to be happy. 

It was all fine until just a couple days ago. She got really mad at me and said I don’t come visit her enough. FYI we only took one car out here, hers, because we figured we’d both be living together and wouldn’t need two. So she has her car at her apartment, which is like 20 miles away. She has been driving to come see me like every other day or so, but said she doesn’t want to do that anymore because she is spending too much on gas and that I need to come to her more often. 

Problem is, the only way to get there is a like hour long bus journey. And to get to the bus stop is like a half mile long walk from staff housing, then I have to wait for the bus and ride it to another bus station where I have to get on a second bus that would take me to her house. It wouldn’t be that bad, but by the time i get off work it is completely dark out, and like 10 degrees or less and windy. So it’s freaking freezing and not a fun trip at all. She also said I should come visit her on my days off, but I only have two days off a week and they are the only days I can snowboard, so that’s what I am going to do. We planned to come here together so we could ski and snowboard together. I’m not wasting a day off to come visit  her when we could have just been snowboarding together if she hadn’t quit and left me living alone in staff housing (now they’re also going to put me with a random roommate since she moved out of my room).

Edit: Also I was never really that supportive of her moving out. I told her that I’d rather her not move out and we just stick to the plan, but that it was ultimately her decision. We had been planning it over a year. Honestly it really hurt my feelings when she wanted to move away from me in less than a month after we moved in together. We had been planning to do this for so long together and also had so many summer plans we had planned to do after the season was over, that are now all ruined. 

I didn’t even want to come to this ski resort in the first place, I wanted to go to one in Utah. But we chose this one because she had friends who worked here and she wanted to work with them.

But the thing is: that's from you. It was once appetizing food, you've taken everything you needed from it, said excrement has sat within your body, it enters a bowl of water which is flushed clean repeatedly, but we're opposed to handling it because...It's poo?

&amp;#x200B;

People:

""Link"" \[24M\]

""Marco"" \[24M\]

Me/OP: \[24F\]

""Janet"" \[not sure... 23F?\]

""Miss Awesome"" \[24F\]

""Roger"" \[24?M\]

""Jessica"" \[F, not sure of age\]

&amp;#x200B;

I dated a guy for 8 years, ""Marco,"" we were high school sweethearts, he was my first love and my first everything else. But we hit an incompatibility last year: he wanted to be polyamorous and I wanted to be monogamous. We tried to make it work for a few months, but the relationship got toxic and so painful. So we split on October 5th last year. We'd been living together since we were 19, had plans to get married, house, kids, everything. In the early days of my relationship with ""Marco,"" there was another guy, ""Link.""

&amp;#x200B;

From the moment I saw ""Link,"" my brain shattered. The only thing I could think was: ""WOW."" We have several mutual friends, so I saw ""Link"" a few times a year at social events. I forced myself to keep my distance from him because I was very committed to my relationship with ""Marco."" But my god, ""Link"" broke my brain every single d\*mm time I looked at him.

&amp;#x200B;

After ""Marco"" and I broke up, I was insanely depressed. Slept a lot, couldn't bring myself to do much of anything. After 2 months I started getting myself back on my feet, and I started talking to ""Link."" I knew it was a bad idea, I mean, I've had like an 8 year crush on ""Link,"" what did I expect to happen?

&amp;#x200B;

I fell hard for him, of course. 3 months after my break up with ""Marco,"" I confessed my feelings to ""Link."" ""Link"" was very upfront with me about his emotional baggage, he let me know it was a very tumultuous time for him romantically, he'd just found out the girl he adored, ""Janet,"" had gotten married behind his back without telling him. ""Link"" and ""Janet"" had been in a not so healthy relationship together, which i won't talk about because ""Link"" confided that in me. He didn't eat for a few days, locked himself in his room... he was heartbroken.

&amp;#x200B;

On Wednesday, a week ago, I checked in with him, and he told me about the excruciating pain he was in. We talked on the phone for six hours, it felt like 5 minutes to us both. He asked me what my plans were, and I told him I had none. ""Link"" invited me over to go for a nice walk outside. By the time I got to his apartment, it was really dark, too late for a walk. I brought him food and Starbucks, and instead we sat on the couch and watched anime together and enjoyed our meal.

&amp;#x200B;

I have BAD social anxiety. Normally I get the worst knot in my stomach, I get antsy, nervous, terrified... not this time. This was my first time being alone with him, and I've never felt more safe, more comfortable, more relaxed. Even when ""Link's"" roommate, also a guy I've never met, came home, I still felt safe, and warm and comfortable. We spent the night cuddling and telling each other ""I love you."" We decided to be exclusive together that night, he cut contact with ""Janet."" I think I asked ""Link"" a hundred times if he was okay, if he was feeling whiplash or nervous or uncomfortable. He asked me the same, we both felt fine.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't go home until 3 that morning. We kissed each other goodbye, and I headed home.

&amp;#x200B;

Here comes ""Miss Awesome."" She's VERY close with ""Link,"" she's married to one of ""Link's"" very long time friends and she's a mutual friend between me and ""Link."" If the name didn't give it away already, she's awesome  ""Link"" chatted with her about me, he said he didn't want to mess things up this time, that he wanted to do it right. ""Miss Awesome"" told him it'd be best if he and i take things slowly, not rush in, do things ""right."" I asked her for advice too, and she messaged me this:

&amp;#x200B;

""I respect you so much for asking me. Like I love that you asked me. For the longest time ""Link"" has tried to make things work with people that try to make him into something that he's not. And that is the problem. The girls that he has been with love the idea of him that they create and can't handle when he deviates from that. I strongly support you guys. With that being said, I think you both would be doing yourselves an injustice if you didn't take it slow.  Personally I know ""Link"" can be rather difficult to navigate a relationship with and just as much as I'd hate you you to hurt him, I'd also hate for him to hurt you. I think you both need to in a way, court each other. Spend time together but also, spend time together with other people around too. It can be amazing falling for someone when its the two of you, but being around friends with him is important too. I can honestly say that your relationship with ""Link"" is very welcomed and I'm so happy that it's you.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Link"" and I agree with her, we should take it slow...

&amp;#x200B;

We didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

After that Wednesday, ""Link"" invited me to meet his older brother that weekend. We had a great beachside walk, ate ice cream, laughed about the music that was playing. We headed back  to his apartment after, where ""Link"" played his guitar and sang to me... his roommate ""Roger"" came home with ""Jessica,"" who is ""Rogers' "" girlfriend. ""Roger"" looked at ""Link"" and I and said ""Wow, this is the cutest most cliche thing I've ever seen."" We laughed. ""Link"" played his guitar and sang to me for awhile, ""Roger and Jessica"" clapped and made whooping noises for the first song, then they went to ""Roger's"" room.

The night with ""Link"" was wonderful, he loves cuddling and so do I. We talked, we cuddled... I knew where it was going next, he did too. We had sex together in his room. ""Link"" was worried about me, how I'd feel, if I'd regret it (I didn't). I knew there was a possibility that he'd just want sex and then leave me cause that's all he wanted... and you know what? I didn't care. I wanted him so badly that I didn't care if he was using me or not.

&amp;#x200B;

We took a shower together after and talked for a bit. I asked if ""Roger"" would judge ""Link,"" and ""Link"" said, ""oh, definitely."" I teased him and asked how many girls he'd had stay over with him.

&amp;#x200B;

Zero. He'd never had someone stay the night before... and the last time he'd slept with someone was over 2 years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I stayed the night. The next morning, ""Link"" started up his record player, and picked out his favorite records to play. We were going to make breakfast for everyone, from down the hall ""Jessica"" exclaimed, ""...is he playing his records?!"" ""Link"" and I laughed, he shouted: ""Yeah?! So what?!""

&amp;#x200B;

Well... turns out ""Jessica"" is WAAAY better at breakfast than us... so she made breakfast for everyone and ""Roger"" helped as much as he could. The whole time, ""Roger"" and ""Link"" were singing along to the record player and picking different songs. The four of us are breakfast together, and I headed home around 3pm.

&amp;#x200B;

Another one of our mutual friends asked ""Link"" over the phone, ""How are things going with OP?"" So er, cats out of the bag, our friends have been spreading the word about ""Link"" and i...  pretty quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

We set up date night at my apartment this weekend, ""Link"" is staying the night at my place and I'm making him homemade macaroni for dinner. Sunday I'm taking him to my favorite restaurant, which I have a gift card to so it doesn't cost either of us much.

&amp;#x200B;

Guys... I know, I know it's stupid to be moving this quickly, I know I've only been single for 3 months, I know ""Link's"" probably not over ""Janet."" I can't stop thinking about every day I've spent with him. I've never felt so safe and so secure with anyone before, ""Link"" says he feels the same way.

&amp;#x200B;

So here's where my question comes in: in your opinion, have I met my soul mate, or am I just being a naive hopeful idiot?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: got involved with a guy too quickly after both of us got dumped by our old partners, spent all day with him Wed., had sex with him a few days later, plans for a third date this weekend. Am I in love? Or am I an idiot?

Other question: How should ""Link"" and I proceed from here? How do I handle the honeymoon phase we're in and how do I make it less painful to be away from him?

Note: i don't regret anything so far, except any negative emotions I might have caused him over this last week, or confusions.",0,0,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,nsfw,Did I [24F] find my soul mate [24M] or am I just being an idiot?,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/kwz2m3/did_i_24f_find_my_soul_mate_24m_or_am_i_just/,promo_adult_nsfw,4.0

We started dating as I was graduating high school. It was a mess at the time—I had just ended a very emotionally abusive relationship and immediately jumped into a relationship with this guy (let’s call him “John”) because he was my best friend at the time and felt familiar. We were kids—young and naive and definitely weren’t right for each other. But, Joe felt safe and comfortable to me at the time. He was someone I was close with for years when I had been dealing with a couple of unrelated yet VERY traumatic events.

As the relationship went on, things started to go very downhill very fast. I won’t go into particulars, however there is one instance that has been on my mind more and more lately. 

When we both became sexually active, I noticed that he would start slapping my ass all the time. In public? Yes. At home? Yes. At a friends house? Yes. 

Every single time he did it, I would tell him “Stop doing that.” Or “No!” in a very serious tone, but he would just giggle and say “but I love your butt so much!” And would continue doing it. It even lead to multiple serious sit down conversations where I would calmly explain to him that it both made me very uncomfortable and I did not like being constantly
objectified. Again, he would respond the same way with “It’s not a big deal. Your ass is great! Don’t take it so seriously.” 

Eventually I gave up and realized that nothing I can say would stop him. Please don’t ask me why I still stayed with him—I was still very young, immature, and processing a LOT at once. 

It wasn’t until recently with my current partner (“Steve”) that I noticed my negative reaction to it still. I was getting dressed a couple of days ago and Steve came up and gave my ass a little pat and I IMMEDIATELY jumped and asked him to not do that. He apologized and assured me it would never happen again.

Now that I am in a very healthy place (in therapy, on medication, living on my own and in a healthy relationship with a man who honestly loves me) I am starting to reflect on past relationships again. I never had given much thought to this particular situation before and I’m unsure of how to feel or think about it. The thought didn’t even occur that it could be harassment/assault until last night as I was lying down for bed. This morning I shared the story with Steve, who was appalled by the mistreatment I had experienced. Now it’s really starting to stop me in my tracks again as I further process it and I am trying to wrap my mind around what it was. Does anybody have any insight or a clear definition? 

TL;DR ex boyfriend slapped my ass despite my consistent negative reactions and asking him to stop.

I was 16, living at home with Mum and Dad. It was School Break/School Holidays so staying up late and waking up later was the standard procedure. 

This particular weekday morning, id woken up feeling particularly horny so decided to grab my magazine of choice from my Wardrobe and hammer one out. This was circa 2000 so magazines were still the way to run, Pornhub wasnt quite on the scene yet. 

Deed completed, i was about to follow my usual post rub ritual by putting the magazine back in my wardrobe, and as my bedroom was right next to the bathroom, go in there and clean the deposit off my hands and down the plug. 

But i was stopped short this time, my Mother who had yet to go to work started calling my name while walking up the Hallway towards my shut Bedroom door. 

She kept calling it, and she kept getting closer, and closer, pretty soon she was going to be opening my door to say bye before she went to work. 

The issue was, i was in the middle of the Room, too far from the Wardrobe to rub the deposit somewhere in there, but also too far from the Bed to rub the deposit on the sheets. With Mumma Bear about to open the door and catch me with a hand full of her Grandchildren, i panicked, chucked it down the back of my throat and swallowed it. 

Mum walks into my room as soon as the gulp had taken place. ""Im off to work now love"" she says.
Feeling a little awkward, the taste of man paste still loitering in my mouth, i say ""Ok Mum, have a good day"" then kiss her on the cheek with my wad tainted lips.

It starts with my wife of many years and her obsession with big dogs. She loves the damned things, the bigger the better. Although we have an average suburban 3-2-2 house with the average (not much) suburban back yard, I eventually relented and we got a big, derpy Golden Retriever. All was fine except for her insistence on getting the dog a partner. We simply don't have enough space for another big dog but she would continue to press.
The TIFU part happened one afternoon while driving around town running errands. We saw a couple on the sidewalk with two big Black Labs. Obviously that was followed with ""see, he let her have two large dogs!"" Being one with a tendency to talk first/think later, my response was quick and concise:

""True, and I'll bet she still gives her husband blowjobs too!""

We're polar opposites and we like different stuffs but we usually just try to meet in the middle. I really love him and i have been really attached to him. He's really loyal and i never doubt him. 

One of our differences is our libido. My libido is low (Due to stress and pills). He, however, treats sex as a need and is ALWAYS always craving for it. Always. Morning or night. Sex is his love language and he cannot show his full love without it. I have to admit that our sex life didnt start well because of problems with consent. We tried to adjust and though it was slow, we made progress over time. He respected when I say no or Im not in the mood. I do say yes once a week but it seems insufficient for him. I have to be honest that it is hard for me since we started in a way that i would not like to remember. 

When the pandemic started, we went LDR because i lived in a different part of the country. We then continued to argue more about sex. He insists that I view sex as ""disgusting"" and that I wont understand him. I don't really think that way about sex and I would glady give it to him if he doesnt act like he's ""guilt tripping"" me whenever I say no. He says that I am the cause of his depression is and the deprivation of his needs. Im really hurt knowing I caused it. But the more he acts like that, the more withdrawn I feel. Im trying to understand him and i do want to understand him. Im really worried about him and I do feel sorry for him. 

Regarding his mental health, he did not want to go to therapy mostly due to financial concerns (really expensive here). I cannot force him to it and he convinces himself that he will heal through time (and me, unfortunately). 

I really love him and Im really worried of what might happen if I leave him. I want to give him what he needs but I cant force myself to do what I dont want to do.
I really dont know the question to ask here. Should I stay and hope it all magically changes or should I leave and be a desperate mess and worry about what he would do to himself although I really am attached to him.

We have no issues talking about sex and both our sex drives are very high, which is great for us when we're together in person. But during COVID we have been living in different countries and barely been able to see each other throughout last year. 

Which brings us to the problem: I can't get myself to enjoy sexting again. Or phone sex. Or sometimes even taking sexy pictures. By again, I mean that I used to very much enjoy it in previous relationships. I do get horny throughout the day, I'm attracted to him and we send each other flirty messages, but as soon as the chat drifts towards sexting I'm out. 

I've had a handful of negative experiences with my previous partners.. being pressured into sex when I didn't feel like it, them asking me to text them a sexy fantasy so that they could get off, them bursting into an argument when I tried to tell them what I like in bed and so on. And I think this might be the reason I just can't get into sexting anymore. As soon as my current partner hints towards the fact that they are horny I feel an overwhelming amount of pressure that I now have to act on that. Or when we do try sexting I feel like there's an expectation that I have to touch myself and get myself to climax (even if I didn't feel like it.) And of course there's a fear to disappoint them. 

I just don't know what to do. It makes me feel hopeless. I enjoy sex and I love my partner and he turns me on, but I feel that no matter what he does or how the topic is approached I always feel this pressure, even though he has never pressured me into anything.

Ten minutes ago I found out. Ten goddamn minutes ago, I found out that a worldview I've held my entire life is, in fact, not true, and apparently I'm just a weirdo.

You see, whenever I exercise, something goes haywire in my brain that spikes my libido to something ridiculous. Think Jekyll and Hyde. That's weird for me to type, because my entire life I thought that was *everyone.* I legitimately thought that was just a common thing: people exercise, and as a result get turned on.

And you know what, in my defense how could I not. What are workout ads if not ""grr sweat lookat this sweaty sexy body grr,"" and like 30% of all porn involving women in their 30's (which is like 90% of my porn) can be summed up with ""hey you know what goes great with pilates? penis."" I thought you people were like me, who legitimately got turned on through exercise, because why else would you advertise it like that and have so many euphemisms? Dafuq is wrong with you? But apparently I was just dropped on my head too many times as a child or something.

Fuck. Now this is a FUCK UP because as I'm typing this in real time, I'm remembering all the times in my life I've tried to incorporate cardio into foreplay. No, you idiot, not like ""hur dur lets do planks in bed before we blast our triceps,"" but christ, ugh this hurts so damn much to type now that I know it's *all a lie* but shit like getting bootycalls and responding with shit like ""mhm lemme do a quick workout first"" OH GOD I'm realizing how fucking stupid that is if there's no context WHY DIDNT ANY OF YOU TELL ME THIS. I THOUGHT SHE UNDERSTOOD AND WAS ON THE SAME WAVELENGTH BUT INSTEAD I WAS THE FUCKING FOOL WHO WAS DOING SQUATS IN THE GYM BEFORE SEX. DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I DID THAT SHIT THINKING THEY WORKED THE SAME WAY AND EXERCISE ALSO GOT THE BLOOD FLOWING AND WAS THE MOTHER OF APHRODISIACS AND

Oh god. Oh god oh FUCK. ink;efwerioj'ewij'oderwo'ijerfij'eruhotrijepr I'VE TOLD THEM TO WORK OUT BEFORE TOO. Oh my good Jesus Christ I

I can't believe I did that. Oh my god save me I didn't know. I LITERALLY TOLD GIRLS I WAS WITH, thinking in my STUPID BRAIN, my STUPID STUPID BRAIN, that it would be hot if they worked out beforehand. *I told them they should work out more.*

What the fuck was I doing I'm literally melting in horror here right now. I'm remembering it all; I literally thought it would do the same thing to them as it did to me, make the sex better, make everything better, but instead, INFUCKINGSTEAD I'm the goddamn JACKASS who probably came across as 'HUR DUR TONE UR ABS BEFORE HAVING SEX WITH ME' or some nightmarish nonsense. Like some hellish dudebro straight from the bowels of the foulest yacht club fraternity. FUCK. How the FUCK did they put up with that. How the FUCK do I apologize for that, because what the fuck am I going to do just call them up and be like ""hehe hey yeah Angie I know it's been five years since we've talked and I know you're in a lovely relationship but I wanted to tell you those times I tried to get us to go on a jog before sex wasn't because I thought you were fat but because apparently something's wrong with my brain.""

No. No, I can't do that, I have to live with that. For the rest of my life, my goddamn life I have to live with that. Why didn't you tell me. Why didn't any of you tell me. All the 'workout euphemisms' I've used with girlfriends. Oh god their blank stares make sense now. Fifteen years of dating, fifteen years of blank stares. It all makes sense now. It all makes sense.

Oh god. oh fuck.

TL;DR

Christ. Something is odd with my brain in that exercise of any form spikes my libido, and from workout ads, euphemisms, etc, I believed everyone on earth worked the same way. So I've incorporated that into my relationships and flings, like a goddamn idiot, my entire life, much to their confusion. No one corrected me. Found out just now that no, it doesn't work like that.

*Edit: I’ll respond to these comments later, I’ve got some... apologies to make first. Not sure how I’m going to go about “I’m sorry that I made us jog before sex” sound sincere, but I’ll think of something.*  


*Update: Apologized to an ex I'm still close with about this, she thought it was the funniest thing ever. Apparently she just thought I was 'super into my body,' like an egomaniac. Which is...... better? I dunno, glad I closed that up but don't think I'll message the exes I'm not on good terms with; that would be too dumb to just casually bring up after five years of not talking.* ",0,0,tifu,t5_2to41,nsfw,TIFU by mistakenly believing exercise turns you on for nearly thirty years.,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/l80g8l/tifu_by_mistakenly_believing_exercise_turns_you/,promo_adult_nsfw,29821.0

I also often times misunderstand certain things. I can tend to go off topic, so please forgive me for that.

I’m almost 15(male). And I’ve been talking with another person on Discord for months now. She’s 14 as well. So I was on my Switch playing Splatoon 2. I saw someone who had their Discord name tag as a username. I sent them a friend request. My memory is pretty muddy to remember what we were talking about. We slowly started to open up to each other. Learning more of who we are. It pretty cool knowing someone who was living in Mexico and I was in the U. S. We did play some games together but never vc’ed.

Eventually though, she began opening up to more of her life. Several things that were extremely shocking. She’s been having suicidal thoughts in these past few months. I tried to help her as much as possible. Making her feel better. She also had a boyfriend that had manipulated her. With making her share nude pics, leading her into the comfort zone and completely destroying her mental state, keep motivating her to kill herself, and some other things that I unfortunately can’t remember off the top of my head. I’ll bring up an update with going back to older conversations to see what he said to her. She and so many other females have been victims of giving nudes to this guy. They have all dated him. So another ex of the girl I’ve been talking with was offering a deal. What they’ll help with is beating up this one guy that has manipulated all of these girls. But in return, they all have to give nudes to these to these two males. She’s been asking me for advice in so many of her recent situations. A quick thing I want to mention is, me and her have multiple illnesses. But it’s extremely hard for me because I’m a terrible guidance. It’s that I’m afraid my help will do far more harm than benefit.

Another issue she’s been needing to deal with is her own family. Her father has sexually abused her in the past. Now he doesn’t live with her anymore. The step-dad is different, but not in a good way. I want to talk about her mother first though. Her mother often times is always insulting her. Whenever she forces her to be something else, she begins to get physical with her. What I mean is her mother often times tries to mold her into a certain personality while she wants to be her own self. Everyone over there is always about wanting to show their sexuality. Girls tend to wear clothes that show lots of skin. She on the other hand, isn’t like that. So her mother keeps forcing her to be like everyone else. Her mother always gets clothes that are sexy rather than her daughter getting clothes that she wants. She isn’t like other females her age. Moving away from that, her mother is always constantly giving death threats to her and such. Back to her step-dad, this girl I’ve been talking with has told me that he’s a complete idiot. He does nothing around the house, has no job, constantly gets drunk while watching T. V., and always puts himself as if he’s perfect. From what she’s told me, her brothers are ok, but her younger sister. She always says that she’ll never be able to get a boyfriend that truly loves her, always gossiping, and saying she can’t be as successful as others.

She’s been getting professional help for a while now. Taking medications to control her mental illnesses and trauma. She’s been talking to me that she doesn’t want to take them. Again, I’m horrible at helping others. I really do want to help other people, but often times I do more bad than good. I’ve taken multiple meds for myself and they’ve helped me a lot. So I tried to convince her to take the meds because they’ll help you with your current mental state. That I’ve taken them for year now, and they’ve helped me with my mental health. She keeps saying that she doesn’t need any help at all from anybody, she only needs me to feel better. That she can act completely normal without any meds. This goes on for a while, until I stop because I feel like I’m trying to force her now rather than it being help. I know that I can’t do as well as the professionals. They’ve had the experience and training for this over several years. I know that psychologists can be a double edged sword, but they can help her far better than I can.

Shifting away from the psychological part now. She asks me for so many important life decisions. Like should she travel to France or Germany so she can study there. I really can’t “help” her in this situation. That’s really something she has to decide for herself. Because this is about what she wants learn about to prepare for her future. She wouldn’t stop insisting for me to choose. Things like this, she always asks for my advice. I really want to help. I really do. I’m just scared that I’ll do more negative than positive. She also has her uncle that occasionally visits her to help her with emotional support, so I’m happy about that. A quick thing about the psychological part, she can’t be truly honest with the psychologist of what her mother does. Because if her mother finds out, she’ll give a major beating.

Recently though, in these past couple of months, things have been getting intense. That her mother will send her children to an orphanage or send them to juvenile hall. Close calls with fights. Saying that her mother saying she will kill her grandmother. Her mother just won’t leave her alone. If she ever goes to her room go cry, her mother will come and spontaneously ground her taking away her phone leaving no communication between us. There have been some other things with her mother, that sadly I can’t think of out of the top of my head.

Yes, I have suggested to try and contact the police. But the police department is over two hours away by foot. And her mother recently hasn’t allowed her to leave the house at all. Even then, if she gets the police to arrest her, there are several downsides. One being that her mother has threatened to kill her if she ever gets the police involved. There’s no real way to completely prevent that be because the police need to make a case. So that’s gives her enough time to do kill her daughter. Another big downside is her step-dad won’t do anything to take care of her and her brothers and sister if her mother ever does get arrested. Most likely no family will want to take care of them all and won’t have any patience to do it anyways. And some more very bad downsides.

Now, I want to talk about myself for a good while now. I’m really sorry for going off topic for way too long about this. But I feel like all of this next segment is definitely worth mentioning. I need to do so many things throughout the day. I manage high school with some decently difficult classes. Having homework to do immediately after tons of schoolwork is already stressful. But I’ve been playing piano for about six years now. So I’ve been also having to find time to practice piano to be able to progress and learn new songs. I take martial arts because I’ve been physically bullied severely. Needing to stay physical and practice these movements so I can defend myself. Yet I still have to take tutoring for help on certain areas in school. I have so many different classes I have to attend in the evenings. With the occasional practice of signing at times. Somehow, I still find the hours in the day to mainly play League of Legends and a few other games. It’s really hard trying to juggle so many different things and complete it all as quickly as possible while being efficient. But I always feel like it’s never enough. That I can’t do anything right. Practically anyone can do what I do, but so much better and faster. I really want to be better. Be smarter. Though, I always feel like it’s never enough. Everyone knows something that I don’t know about. It’s really hard to express what this is, but hopefully someone out there will understand what I mean. I’m trying to get straight As so I can try to take community college. That way I can start to get my first degree as soon as possible. However, I feel like anyone else knows far more than what I know of what I want to do in university. When it comes to academic areas, I often times never got the opportunity because I am “mentally retarded”.  I am wanting to be a professional gamer for League of Legends. Afterwards, with the degrees(hopefully) that I’ve received, I can start to create video games. Really quickly, I have several mental illnesses that I’ve needed to try and work around them. One of them, I wouldn’t consider a mental illness, but it’s deep depression. I’ve suffered through this my whole life, with always wanting to have the intent of wanting to suicide. There’s plenty of other stuff that’s wrong, but I don’t think they’re worth mentioning, like going through child abuse by the K-3 teachers. Sorry about that little part, I just thought it was worth putting that out there. Anyways, my parents, especially my father, aren’t the most supportive in the beginning of my planned future. My mother lately has been far more supportive. With getting me everything I need to be a successful gamer and coder. Still, my father is in the complete opposite side. He always discourages me that I’ll never be able to compete against the best of the best. That I may be pretty good, but I’ll never be able to be part of the best. He’s also being extremely sarcastic to my family. I know that both my parents love me and my little sister, a lot. But there’s just these parts of them that makes he question them. My mom has been insulting me repeatedly and always makes herself look like she’s perfect. It’s really hard to have someone to talk to without them making me feel even worse. I also don’t want to talk with this other female that I’ve known for months now because I don’t wan’t her go carry my stress. I’ll admit, I have no friends. I’ve never had any in person nor any online either. Except for this one person. Another female who’s 21 that I met through a Discord server has been my friend for a while now. She also mainly plays Splatoon 2. After a few days of talking, I wanted to open up more. I did. She helped me feel a little bit better about myself. No one was willing to try and help me with true sincerity. Not even my psychologists were able to help me as much as she did. She didn’t do any teasing to me like most of my psychologists do. She’s also an extremely nice and patient person to me. We’ve played before with vc and it was an absolute blast actually vcing with someone that wasn’t toxic at all. Like she was a friend to me. I cried a few times while vcing unfortunately because I wanted to open up more with my personal issues. But it could’ve been late at night and she was tired, but wouldn’t go to sleep until I was ok. She’s been really helping me with continuously fighting against the thought of me wanting to suicide. She has been a really great friend to me. That’s out of the way now. Sorry for that unnecessary stupidly long segment.

Back the the original topic, with the female that I’ve been talking with. These recent weeks, she’s been far more laid back that it’s ok now if anything goes wrong and she dies. This is very obvious that this is not ok. I keep trying to help her, but she keeps saying not to worry. I’m really nervous that she might want to take her life away. She’s told me that she’s been wanting to try and cut her arms off. A lot of her close boy friends are constantly telling her that it’s best to suicide, that’s an incredibly useless person, that she’s been really lonely lately, her mom is being mean more than ever now, and to not worry about her that she’ll be fine. She did try to turn the conversation around with saying that her mom is buying her cosplay. But still, I’m really worried. That for her, it’s normal to just get scars and cuts. She’ll begin to become what her mom wants her to be. She’s been telling me she hasn’t been watching anime nor playing video games that way she can do more of what her mom wants her to be. That if she ever “loses the fight”, it won’t be of my fault, rather someone else because they hurt her a lot. Yet, she still says to not worry about her.

I really hope someone can help me and that this post doesn’t get lost. I don’t want her to take away her own life.",0,0,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,nsfw,Helping someone on Discord (mostly),https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/l5qtoc/helping_someone_on_discord_mostly/,promo_adult_nsfw,2.0

Do you feel this same uncomfortable/hard to pee feeling afterwards? Or can you pee 100% normally?

My nose started gushing blood when I was giving head to a guy on our official “first” date

So, the guy in question is the guy I have been talking too for over a month. We began as strictly causal and platonic but it did not last long. We had only had sex prior to this and it’s been a roller coaster emotionally for us both as the feelings we developed for each other were completely out of no where. We’re still trying to figure it out.

However, today he took me out for dinner and had me tag along with him to go to Walmart so he could buy a dresser for his room. It was a very simple night and probably the best date i’ve been on. 

We’re about to conclude the night and we start making out. He makes it known to me that he has to pick up his sister from her friends house and that he has to get going. Me being me, I ask him for one more minute and then start to tease him. 

He asks if I can give him head before he goes and doesn’t care if he’ll be a little late, he just wanted me too. I was absolutely down to do it and was hoping he would ask. 

I start going at it, things are going great, he’s enjoying himself a lot and i’m being a champ. He’s close to finishing and then.....

My nose starts gushing blood. I mean gushing. I immediately stop and put my hand over my nose while trying to find something to catch the blood like a tissue or anything. I end up taking my black cardigan off and using that while I grab a tissue from my purse. He’s holding it to my nose and deeply concerned about my gushing nose and my hand, cheek, and arm being covered in blood. 

He asks if i’m okay and I explain to him that I get bloody noses all the time during the winter because having heat on makes my nose dry and bleed. He had the heat on high in the car and my nose decided to bleed. He tells me that he doesn’t care about himself and that I can be done and I don’t have to finish. 

I say to him, “I’m gonna finish what I started just let me put a tissue in my nose so blood doesn’t keep coming out.” He just looks at me shoving the tissue in my nose and compacting it so no blood comes out. 

Blood still on my hand, arm, and cheek. Nose still bleeding and yet

I did absolutely finish what I started. Then shortly after, I was hit with a massive wave of nausea and shortly vomited in the parking lot shortly after. I had a 20 minute drive home. 

Chick-fila, cum, and blood do not go well together in your stomach. At all. 

I’m not sure if he sees me as wife potential or insane...or both.

TL;DR: I was giving head to a guy i’m in a romantic situation with but not officially, it was our “first” date that wasn’t just casual sex. My nose starts gushing blood as he’s close to finishing. I stop and compact a tissue up my bleeding nostril. I proceed back to giving him head and finished what I started despite my nose actively bleeding and blood being all over my hand, arm, and cheek. Shortly after, I violently vomited up Chick-Fila, cum, and the blood from my nose in the parking lot.

EDIT: I’ll provide an update of his feelings regarding this situation as I have yet to ask but I just did!",0,0,tifu,t5_2to41,nsfw,TIFU by giving a blowjob while my nose was gushing blood,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/l5udwh/tifu_by_giving_a_blowjob_while_my_nose_was/,promo_adult_nsfw,50.5

I've tried my best to help raise her and make her feel loved but I've had to give up 6 years of the prime of my life because of my mom's mistakes and sometimes it's hard to be partial to what I've lost too. 

My mom now tries to kind of be in my younger siblings' lives every so often by trying to buy their love. She bought my sister a phone when she was around 10, because I happened to have a very bad situation where one of my mom's fb friends sexually harassed me I didn't want my little sister to be exposed to this, I put parental controls on her phone. My mom bothered me for over a year before I decided since at the age of 13 it removes them anyway I'd remove them as a birthday present. I deeply regret that I failed her by doing this.

 I went on her phone today to try and find a picture she had taken at christmas that she never sent me and was going to send it to myself. As soon as it connected to my hotspot tons of notifications from a new game app she downloaded with messages from an 18+ group started flooding the phone. 

I couldn't get them to load because my hotspot connection is poor but the very inappropriate group name with 18+ in the title was enough. I decided to go through her phone and found a conversation in her facebook messages with a young man who is older than 18 and clearly knows better was asking her for nude images and was sending her dick pics. She seemed hesitant to send any back but she did ask him for pictures and talked about ""loving sex and porn"" (I know she hasn't done anything physical as I am with her almost every second she isn't in school)

I'm furious but trying to cool down because just getting angry at her isn't going to be productive and will just teach her to try and hide better in the future. I feel horrible that I didn't protect her well enough, How do I broach this with her in a way that will be stern but also productive and give her the chance for help if she needs it?

Me 24(f) and my boyfriend 26(m) have recently started experimenting with anal/prostate/male g-spot activities. We have been dating for a year, live together, and want to liven up our sex lives.  We recently got one of those strap-ons that goes in the girl and the girl essentially has a penis and the first time we used it he said it felt like it opened up a new world of pleasure. (I am obviously very open-minded and willing to do what makes him feel good because that makes me feel good - within boundaries of course;)). I want to get better at satisfying him in that way but need some advice.

I have a few questions/pieces I would like advice on.

1. So I know when putting a butt plug inside of my bf I am supposed to lead it in with my finger to avoid pain right? Do I keep my finger in there until it is fully in or just until the base is in the push from the bottom?
2. Sometimes it has been hard keeping the strap on inside me (female) for the part that goes inside me and falls out and ruins the experience. It is ""tight"" so wondering if there is a better brand or something? I have the underwear you stick it through to help with that part.
3. I need to figure out how to use the fake dick/strap on properly. This morning, I was just going to use my hand instead of putting the strap-on on me and whatever I was doing didn't feel good. Of course, It is large-ish and I know that wiggling smaller things side to side stimulates the prostate helps too. But for the larger strap on fake dick, any advice? Should I just go slower? Make sure I lead it in all the way? angle suggestions?
4. Any advice on how to stimulate female libido, but any tips from people that have renewed their sexual desires and have cool ideas/fun ways to bond with your partner to improve intimacy? When we met, we couldn't keep our hands off each other and I am having a real hard time getting in the mood. It definitely may be stress-related.

Earlier I decided I was going to eat some pizza for lunch, so I grabbed it out of the freezer and tossed it in the microwave and defrosted it for 4 minutes (this wasn’t a frozen pizza, but a pizza that we had ordered a few weeks ago and couldn’t finish). After it defrosted I cooked it for another 4 minutes because it was still cold. Now this, is NOT the fuck up. These 3 pieces of pizza turned out fine but I was still hungry so I stuck the last piece in, except instead of defrosting it, I accidentally cooked it normally. I didn’t realize this and then proceeded to cook it for another 4 minutes just like last time. If I have any mathletes out there, that puts it at a grand total if 8 minutes (in an 1100 watt microwave). I opened the radiation box and was immediately punched in the face by an ungodly smell and a what my friend thought was a 15 year old cum brick. I thought it right into the trash but after smelling it for about 5 minutes I couldn’t take it and just doused it with Lysol. Naive me assuming that would do the trick was completely wrong and decided to just take the nowhere-near-full trash bag straight outside and into the bin. No I just hope to the god I don’t believe in that the smell with be gone by tomorrow morning.

This first concussion already hindered my thesis writing and I think a second one is very likely to alter my degree completion timeline.

I am 21 years old and I have an ex (19) whose in a rough spot right now and contemplating suicide everyday.

Here's some context:

When she first wanted me to be her bf, I refused because I wasn't that attracted to her but she became really sad and I took pity on her. So I decided to be her bf and thought maybe she 'd realize i am not good enough or anything and it will be easier for her to break up and have some closure. However, around this time, another girl who happened to be her friend also wanted me to be her gf, I accidentally said yes to her too. Let's call the girl I was talking about before A and this friend of hers B. My plan was to break up with A in a few days and solely go for B. However, since they were friends, they found out I was cheating on them. Now i was really guilty about this and tried to apologize and win them back. They then agreed on having a polyamorous relationship with me. I was lonely, stupid and desperate at the time so I agreed. However, B soon got diagnosed with Cancer and she refused to take treatment so her mother got angry and kicked her out of the house. A really cared for her so B traveled to her and started living with her. Things were always grim and i soon realized that i was not happy with this relationship and it was affecting my mental health. However, I went along because i wanted to be supportive in their time of need and didnt want to break up at such a bad time. However, this is when things took a turn for the worst. One of A's room mates who she lived with really liked B and had a crush on her. He was jealous of me for having her. I was pathetic and couldnt defend myself or her when he accused me of not loving B enough. After spending some time with her for a few days, one day he got drunk, drugged B and raped her. An hour or two before he did it, he mockingly told me what he was going to do and send me pictures of the pill he was going to drug her with and everything. It was so sickening. I tried everything I could to stop him and warn B but B was offline and couldnt get my numerous calls and messages. This was an online long distance relationship and I didnt have their location so i couldnt call the police either. All I could was message and call B and warn her which i did but she was offline and didnt get them. So the sickening act happened and then the room mate disappeared without a trace. Then a few weeks later, B cancer gets worse and she also finds out she's pregnant from the rape. I tried to help them as much as i could by offering supportive words and looking for support / charity websites and sending their links. They always thought my help wasn't enough but i never understood what more i could do. It was an online thing after all. I was pretty stressed by the relationship at this point and wanted to distance myself so I stopped chatting with them as much as i did before. I got busy with college too so i couldnt chat much anyway. I only replied to their messages if they sent any. A and B always told me that the three of us will always be together and made me promise to it which i half-hazardly did. I had planned to break up soon now. I was already so stressed by everything. So one day, A tells me that B died. I was so horrified and sad. My mental state was really stressed out at this point so i stupidly decided to break up with A right then and there. I just couldnt handle any more of their misery. She didnt handle it very well and blamed me for manipulating her and not truly loving her. She then threatened to kill herself and leave a photo of me by her corpse. I was so horrified. I didn't want to be charged with murder or anything like that. I tried to calm her down and told her that I still love her as a friend. She didn't buy it and then just told me that she hopes i move on smoothly. For weeks I was anxious that she might kill herself and pin it on me. I started to move on a little as i got more busy with college. A few weeks later, I deleted all my messages with A and B and deleted my discord account (this is where it all started and happened online). I still get anxious from it now whenever I remember it. This leads to a few days ago when I messaged her anonymously to check up on how she's doing. Everyone has disowned her and shes all my herself living in her car. She's depressed and traumatized and still hasnt moved on from the relationship. She still thinks I manipulated her and everything and blames me for ruining her life. I am afraid its only a matter of time before she tries to end her life again.

She's still at the risk of killing herself. Her life is ruined. She has no one and her friends and family have disowned her because of her hysteria. I am so worried for her and for myself. My mental health isn't that good either and was one of the reasons why I broke up with her. I just couldn't handle it and wanted to move on.

However, I have been told by the people at suicide watch that this is a common pattern and that I am being emotionally abused and terrorized and I should stay away from her as much as possible because she would do anything to ruin my life if she could get away with it. I still want some more advice on the topic and what precautions I could take which is why I posted here. I know I have made a lot of mistakes and I swear to never do them again. Please don't judge me and help me out. ;-;

Also, if there is a subreddit where you can talk to people for advice and sympathy in a confidential way without being judged no matter what you did, please let me know.

I have this problem alot, so I had recently bought some Gold Bond body powder to combat this issue. While I was buying the body powder, I had also noticed Gold Bond sold some medicated foot powder so I decided to pick that up as well because, well why the hell not. The important part about this is that the bottles look extremely similar (look it up) they just are different colors, and I kept both of them on my nightstand. Anyways, I come home and grab what I believe to be the body powder and lather on a generous amount all over my nether regions. Within a minute or so, I start getting an uncomfortable feeling down there and the area starts getting irritated. It’s at this time when I look over at the bottle on my nightstand and realize my mistake. The uncomfortable  feeling quickly develops into brutal pain, and within the next minute or so it becomes borderline unbearable. I haul ass out of bed and sprint into my bathroom while stripping naked and jump into the shower, all the while my nutsack is screaming in blistering pain. I grab the shower nozzle and try to blast the stuff off my nuts to stop the agony, but it doesn’t get much better. I end up curling into a ball on the shower floor clenching my teeth and waiting for the pain to subside, which took at least 2-3 more minutes. After the nightmare was over, I went back in my bedroom and threw that fucking blue bottle across the room to ensure I would never mess up that bad again.

I think I need to break things off with him, but I’m not sure if/how I should do it or if I should give it some more time to see if I can look past it.

I feel terrible. I’ve been seeing this guy for about two months, taking it slow, things have been going pretty well. A few nights ago, he sent me a naked picture of himself for the first time and it’s like a switch went off in my brain and I lost all attraction to him. His penis is very small and without clothes his body is also very petite and it just makes me uncomfortable and it wasn’t what I expected or what I’m attracted to. I’d only ever seen him in thicker winter clothes and without the extra padding they give his body he looks almost prepubescent.

So, obviously, I’m not going to say “The way you look turns me off so we can’t be together” because that would be awful. I was just planning to tell him that after trying being “official” for a few months I just wasn’t feeling it and I didn’t see it working out between us.

I know I shouldn't drag it out longer but I really want to avoid making him self conscious about it too.

I feel like such a shallow, terrible person because of the way I was instantly turned off of him entirely from purely physical stuff. I’m torn between breaking things off with him (gently, with no insinuation that it’s related to his body/penis) and giving it some more time to see if I can get used to it. Thanks in advance for any advice you have for me.

*""You can't morally criticize anything fictional, because morality doesn't apply to it. If you want to say you didn't like it, that's fine, but you don't get to cast aspersions or jump to conclusions because of that.""*

Sorry, but if the people who made the anime tried to make a joke where the setup is a 17 year old character getting sexually assaulted, that means that multiple people involved in making that scene believed it was acceptable and within moral norms to portray sexual assault on-screen and it was fine because it was a joke.

That very DECISION is both a political and moral statement, just as is the classic portrayal of Superman as the all-american who doesn't kill people is, and it being fictional doesn't mean it gets some magical immunity shield where you can't discuss the morality of the action within the scope of the work, nor the morality of the production company for making the collective decision of ""it's fine to make jokes about a woman getting groped against her will.""

If the topic of the portrayals of depression, self-isolation, and social commentary can be had about anime, then discussions about whether or not it's acceptable to depict rape, sexual assault, or other themes are fair game, too.

Susan (pseudonym) and I have been friends since high school. She was in a bad spot in those years because of family issues and I was always there for her. She became dependent on me and started developing feelings, but her feelings were never reciprocated. It was only after when we were in college that she confessed to me that she liked me before. Even though it was obvious through our interactions, I still wasn't certain she actually liked me. During college, we were still very tight, despite studying in different countries. We maintained contact via messages and occasional facetimes. We also both go back to our hometown for long breaks, and we'd meet up quite often. We both had romantic relationships had back in college, but her's were more of a fling, and mine were somewhat committed relationships. Over the years, I think I also started develop feelings for her. But they weren't strong impulsive romantic feelings that you would get from a crush. It's closer to a sense of comfort, knowing that this person can do no wrong, and I would be willing to spend the rest of my life with her. I haven't act upon this feeling because I'm scared of breaking such a good relationship, and would like to postpone doing anything rash until I'm certain that a romantic relationship with her is exactly what I wanted. I've never confessed my feelings for her.

Actual Story: 

On New Years Eve, the plan was to get some drinks with her friends, watch some fireworks and call it a night. Throughout the night, the conversation was heavily directed towards me and Susan. They were all curious how we maintained such a healthy platonic relationship and why haven't we dated (everyone asks us the same question). To which, we both give out the standard, boring answers such as, ""We just don't have that kind of chemistry"" or ""It doesn't feel right"" etc. A few hours in, they were all getting pretty tipsy by the time we left the bar for fireworks. Her friends were still hammering me with questions, while Susan clung on to my arm, barely maintaining her balance. As we walked towards the firework location, Susan's friends were pumped for the fireworks and went ahead for a better view, while I was trying to drag Susan to catch up to them. Then the alcohol kicked in, and Susan also started giving rants. At one point, she blurred out, ""Wouldn't it be a lot easier if we just dated?"". I didn't really respond to her; I just pretended I didn't hear her and told her to move faster since the firework's about to start. At that point, I was genuinely confused. Normally, she was very adamant about this relationship being platonic to others (as demonstrated at the bar). Also, our dynamics weren't quite the same in comparison to the one we had in high school. She was in a much better mental state and didn't really relied on me. I couldn't tell if she meant it or maybe the alcohol was screwing her head. 

Either way, the fireworks ended and it was time to go home. Her friends went their separate ways and Susan and I went back to my place (As I'm writing this, I actually don't know why she didn't just go back to her own place. At the time, it just naturally happened and I didn't question it, or I forgot why. Don't put too much emphasis on this). We got home and quickly took a shower and went to bed. We slept on the same queen bed, with two separate blankets and pillows. This wasn't the first time we slept on the same bed, and nothing has happened previously. It was quite cold that night and my heater was broken, and the blankets were pretty thin. I was shivering and finding ways to keep my body warm. Susan on the other hand was handling the cold perfectly well, as she curled herself up and slept like a baby. I think all my rolling and repositioning must have woke her up. She moved closer and asked if I was cold, which I said a little. She proceeds to move even closer, covered me with her warm blanket, and clung to my arm. At first, it felt weird because we never got to this level of physical intimacy, sharing the same body temperature and physical contact. All this intimacy worked me up, as I turned around to face her and put my arms around her, and we started cuddling. I thought we were both really comfortable with what we were doing. At some point, we started spooning, me being the big spoon. My hands were around her waist, and sometimes on her boobs. Suddenly, she took my hand off her chest, and brought it inside her shirt and on to her naked chest. At this point I should've stopped myself and backed out, but I didn't, and I went with it. I started fondling her breast and squeezing her nipples. She made quiet moans and didn't really stop me from playing with her boobs. This is the furthest we went, after that we just fell asleep naturally. The next morning I called a cab and sent her back home, and we never talked about what happened.

These few days, I felt distanced by her. She's been replying slower than usual, or maybe the guilt is playing with my head. Right now, there's a lot of guilt and fear inside me. Guilt because I let all this intimacy happen because of my selfishness. And I fear for our friendship changing into something irreparable. 

Things that I'm uncertain about:

Since we never talked about it, I'm not even sure if she's conscious about what happened that night.  And if she does, I don't know how she feels about the whole situation. My biggest fear is either she wasn't conscious about it or she was actually extremely uncomfortable the entire time but didn't speak up about it.

I do plan on confronting her soon about it.

I’m in my final year of uni and afterwards want to go travelling and live a pretty free life. On top of this, I have found that I am less and less interested in having sex with her. My sex drive has never been out of this world but I could happily go 7-10 days without sex even if I see her everyday. 

On top of this, I have been on medication for my depression for the past 3 years and over the past few months have found myself feeling like I did before I was medicated. Not saying she is the cause, but rather the situation could be? I’ve tried to do it once before but she broke down and it broke my heart to see her that way so I proposed a break instead. I haven’t been acting off with her so feel if i spring this on her it’ll seem like it’s coming out of nowhere. 

I know I’m young so there will be plenty of other opportunities to meet other people but I don’t want her to be the one that ‘got away’, but I also don’t want to just keep her around in fear of that, whilst depriving her of having someone who will treat her as their no. 1 as she deserves.

I'm sitting on my couch browsing reddit reading someone else's tifu post when my wife, who should be sleeping, comes out of the bedroom holding her checkbook.

In my stupidity, I forgot everything once I got over to her.

We've reached stage two. By using my powerful observation skills I learn what the check is for. Now that my curiosity has been satisfied, I may as well try to distract her by pulling out my dick.

She laughed and apologized, but I ended up waving it off because I knew I was charged, so my fault. 

Tldr: got off the couch that gives 10,000 volt static shocks and then exposed myself to my wife. She booped my dick and I died.

Initially he told me he wanted to wait to have sex (because of personal and religious reasons) which was no problem, except that he kept initiating sexual contact. Most of the time when I initiated something sexual, he'd say he wants to wait for sex, which frustrated and confused me. I'm not sure what changed for him, but a few months ago we started having sex semi-regularly (initiated by him). 

The first time we had intercourse, I wasn't really expecting it and later learned he wasn't wearing a condom (something I believe is very important). I didn't think I could ask him to wear one now that we'd had unprotected sex, so I didn't. (I now understand I can set whatever sexual boundaries I want, though.)

So just last week, we had a pregnancy scare. I was really upset over it and told him so. Especially given how unclear our boundaries have been in the past, I opted to tell him explicitly that we needed to start using two forms of protection like I have in the past -- my hormonal bc and condoms. He said ok, and we discussed it again later in bed, and he agreed to wear them. But right after this second discussion, he tried to have sex with me without a condom, twice! I stopped him both times, but he didn't have an explanation. 

It was hard to trust him sexually in the beginning, because his words and actions were so at odds. But now, after he's directly gone against my request, I don't know that I can trust him at all.

I don't know what to do.I moved out of my house and started college 30 minutes away. I truly do not feel like I was ready to go to college. My senior year of high school ended abruptly in March and I didn't graduate until August. I moved out a week after graduation. I declared my major as graphic design, but after about a month and a half of college I gave up. I was in a toxic relationship and developed a dependency on weed. I no longer attended any of my seated classes, and after a while didn't even attempt to go to Zoom lectures. There were so many excuses; I couldn't get out of bed. I couldn't motivate myself to leave my room. My anxiety was so bad that I couldn't interact with others.

My mental health became awful. I have struggled consistently throughout my life with a multitude of symptoms; I was informally diagnosed with major depressive in high school. I began noticing even more symptoms become more severe or emerge as a result of extreme stress. I began seeking therapy and taking medication again. Once again, I was informally diagnosed, but this time with bipolar II. I scheduled a psychological evaluation to get a proper diagnosis. I have had suspicions I suffer from BPD or ADHD. The evaluation turned out to be a bust; the psychologist claimed the tests were ""inconclusive"" due to me answering the diagnostic questions incorrectly. I feel like I have truly made no progress in improving my mental health and it is affecting my quality of life.

I was in a relationship with one of my closest friends, and my mental illness destroyed it. Ultimately, I drove him away with my toxicity. However, he decided to befriend somebody that I was in a long-term abusive relationship with. I began to have nightmares about them every single night. They are so realistic and vivid that they distort my perception of reality. I feel so anxious whenever I wake up from them that I feel physically ill for a few hours in the mornings. I only really other have one peer in my life (my ""best friend""), and I am beginning to question my friendship with her. Everything she does has started to drive me crazy; the way she chews, the way she drives, the way she talks too much, the way she licks her fingers. Not only that, but she is codependent on me. She constantly talks about how excited she is to move into a house with me, but also how excited she is to *live in a house with me for the rest of my life.* I am a queer woman, but I have never felt or shown any romantic feelings towards her. She makes a lot of sexual remarks towards me and is very touchy, and it has began to make me feel uncomfortable. I do not want to move in with her as we discussed, but I have not yet figured out a way to tell her.

Not only that, but I have been sexually assaulted multiple times. Two occasions occurred in the past 6 months. As a result, I am trying to work through the trauma and anxiety I feel. I feel nervous being around adult men, especially in close proximity or alone. Any type of graphic sexual conversation makes my skin crawl. I cannot stand to even think of myself or anybody else in a sexual way without a feeling of dread in the pit of my stomach. My best friend knows this, and I have communicated with her how her comments make me feel, but it never truly improves.

My best friend also got us in trouble with the law. She picked up a habit/addiction to shoplifting, and I was often roped into going to stores with her. We went to a chain craft store one day, and she pocketed about 200 dollars worth of merchandise. I was extremely uncomfortable and wanted to leave, but she kept going. She (unsurprisingly) set the alarm off, and we got chased outside by the manager. Long story short, the cops were called and we were issued a court date. I did not steal anything, but I was being charged since I knew she was doing it. That was my mistake, and I regret it so much. (The court date was Jan. 28, but it has to be rescheduled due to COVID). I have extreme anxiety over it every single day. I am unemployed. I had a consistent and easygoing job at a local cupcake shop, but the owner became quite abusive and controlling and I left right before Christmas. I have been desperately applying for jobs, and I have a few interviews scheduled, but I have no idea how I am going to make enough money to pay for the fine. I am truly scared.

I am close with my family, but I have maintained the lie that I am doing well in school. They are aware of the state of my mental health, and have been nothing but supportive. I have brought up the idea of dropping out of college with them, but they wanted me to at least stick it out for the Spring semester. It has not gotten any better. I haven't gone to any of my classes, and I even dropped a few of them. (I accidentally dropped too many, and realized I was not enrolled for enough credit hours to live in the dorm. So, once again, another source of stress I have to deal with). I do not want to disappoint them. I feel extremely horrible and guilty for wasting their money; I truly was excited for college. I was doing so well, and everything fell apart. I worked hard to earn scholarships, a good ACT score, and good grades. I was a decent student. I can hardly focus on reading a paragraph nowadays. I have been trying to get into consistent therapy, but every therapist I have found has scheduled me an initial appointment but won't have another opening for months. It is extremely frustrating.

Last week, I also got in trouble with the residence life at my college. I had been drinking, began to throw up too loudly, and had to pretend I was having a panic attack to multiple RAs. Not only this, but my friend's roommates had left a can of white claw on the living room table. They had to write an incident report. I am currently at my family's house, and I have gotten multiple messages that RAs were knocking on my door. I am shaking with anxiety as I type this, lol.

I don't know what to do to get out of this point in my life. I have considered admitting myself to a hospital in order to get a proper diagnosis and treatment, but I cannot because of court and because of the fine I will have to work to pay off. I have to find a job, and I have to start consistently working. I want to drop out of college and move back home to get on my feet, but once again, the fine prevents me from doing this, as well as my fear of disappointing my parents. My medication is not working, and I have been too anxious to call my psychiatrist. I feel extremely hopeless and discouraged, and it feels like switching my meds would not work, and thus be a waste of my time, causing me to spiral into hopelessness even more. I don't know what to do. I feel like it will improve with time, but I can barely think about what I am doing tomorrow without feeling nervous.",0,0,TrueOffMyChest,t5_2yuqy,nsfw,I am stuck in the most miserable point in my life.

My wife just asked me to get a divorce again after me denying her sexual advance last night. I think overall, she uttered the word divorce more than a dozen times in our marriage each time more seriously than the one before. This time though, I said yes, and today, she pretty much avoided me all day without bringing that up again.

She had been saying that she needs physical touch and intimacy but I am not providing it.  The thing is, she says this if I skip just a few days of having sex. I have really been trying. I hugged and kissed every time she leaves or returns from work (I work from home every day due to COVID while she works outside every day). I have sex with her and spoon her during sleep even when I don't want to. However, I'm actually often depressed (as I have a serious ongoing family issue with my parents/brother and other career related issues) and cannot bring myself to do this sometimes, so time to time, I say no. I admit sometimes I am a bit aggressive in saying no. For example, I physically shift my body away from her. I think this is mostly due to the frustration coming from realizing that she can clearly see me in a bad mood and still tries to force sex on me. In some extreme cases, she got drunk and forcefully removed my clothes. I remember one time I had a very painful sex that I had to concentrate hard on finishing so that she could stop inflicting more pain on me grinding very hard on top of me.

Anyways, after I responded yes to her asking a divorce, it felt... good actually. Our marriage did not start with the typical proposal and a ring. It started when we were very young due to her pregnancy (with my child) and her father being a known religious figure (not in the US) couldn't afford his daughter being a single mother. I always hated this circumstance that forced me into this marriage even though I loved her so much.  I think maybe I had been regretting this marriage without realizing it?

I have no idea what to do now though. She's avoiding me. It would be easier if she actually hates me and is preparing a legal form for me to sign, but knowing her, she'll probably just go back to herself in a few days and this issue will repeat.  I cannot imagine myself initiating the divorce process though. I really want her to start it if it's going to happen. Or it will just never happen. One silly thought I had was hoping she would cheat on me, then I will at least have a good reason to initiate the divorce process haha (\*sad chuckle).

So some backstory to this, my dad wanted me to keep a gun on myself anytime I went outside on our property for the rest of the week because we’ve had some trouble with people coming near our house and land unbeknownst to us.

Now for the actual story. So today was real normal, get up for online school, eat breakfast, shower, you know morning stuff, but today was different, my dad wanted me to take our .357 magnum revolver out of the safe so I had a gun ready for anytime I left our house. Keep in mind that I didn’t take it off our property. I go outside for a walk in the woods like normal besides the gun.

We’re close to the FU now, I take the revolver out of its holster to get a feel for it’s weight and how it’s hammer feels, I cock it and uncock it feeling pretty confident then the hammer slips out of my control and hits the firing pin just barely too hard sending it into the primer firing a round off. Anyone who knows things about revolvers knows how revolvers work knows that the cylinder holding the rounds isn’t touching the barrel so it creates a blast out the sides too.

Here’s the FU, my hand is next to the front of the cylinder which blows the top of my ring finger to shreds and my palm is burned severely. I freak out because I’ve basically been shot without a projectile and it’s bloody as hell. I go inside and clean it up and find out I can see the muscle in my finger. (This is kinda gory sorry) I sterilize it and get some bandage and gauze around it and end up missing two of my classes. This is what’s happened as of now so I’ll update if anything happens,

TLDR; I had a revolver’s hammer slip out of my thumbs grip, the gun fired with my hand near the cylinder basically shooting myself in the hand without a bullet.[pics](https://imgur.com/gallery/iQjU5hd)",0,0,tifu,t5_2to41,nsfw,TIFU by shooting myself in the hand,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/kxcvof/tifu_by_shooting_myself_in_the_hand/,promo_adult_nsfw,34.0

Basically, 6 months ago I met my now BF “Kyle”. Kyle and I met thru our friends and just flirted a little. Kyle had liked me for 3 years prior while I was just getting to know him.

Literally a week after I met Kyle, I met “Dustin”. Dustin and I met and hit it off right off the bat. Ever since we met, we would hang out almost every day. 

Whenever I was with Dustin, it was like a movie. My most memorable moments are with Dustin. With Kyle, I sort of started dating him out of convenience (we shared the same friends and he was friends with my professor). 

Once I told Dustin that Kyle and I were dating, he told me he liked me too much to be my friend. We had already fucked at that point, so we were sexually close as well as emotionally close. We stopped talking.

Kyle and I continue dating. I miss Dustin and for a month straight I had cried over him. Kyle and I donr have any major advances in our relationship and I feel like I want to break it off for Dustin. Then 2 months later, Dustin pops back in my life. We hang out. We kiss. He tells me he missed me, he has never felt like this for anybody, life is best when he’s with me, he wants to treat me like I have always wanted to be treated. I truly felt the same way and told him so. He tells me I have to break up with Kyle to be fair to everybody - he tells me this in a friendly manner.

Basically I never broke it off with Kyle because then he told me he loved me. I felt bad. I kept it going and now I love Kyle - I think. Dustin told me he couldn’t be friends with me any more (again) because I’m still dating Kyle. I think about Dustin every day and miss him to pieces.

I always hung out with the boys growing up. when I started to grow up it was a slow prosses do to health problems. I was that person in the group who never had sex (I wanted to wait for marriage) I never touched myself in any way like that I never looked at anyone boy or girl and wanted to have sex with them. (there are characters in shows and moves I like but never like that) I thought this was because of how I grow up. I started dating this person (26M) 3 years ago. I told him from the vary beginning even before we started dating that I wanted to wait for marriage he said that was fine because he did to.

Now hear is the thing he is my first boyfriend ever. Last year I joined a discord full of LGBQ+ people and while talking to a few people they told me I sound like an Ace so after weeks of looking it up and talking to other Ace I figured out it wasn't the way I grow up I was just Ace. I came out to my parents first then my boyfriend. He asked what that meant for us? (If we where braking up) I told him ""no we didn't have to brake up and I still love him. That it just explained why I get so unconfutable when he wanted to do things like make out and touch me sexually (he pushes this because he thought we would be moved in together and married by now)"". I can tell he is frustrated with me because I don't do anything intermit with him unless he starts it and even then I stop it before it gets to far along because I am unconfutable. The words ""I'm sorry I'll try better"" come out of my mouth a lot. He is upset because he is vary into sex (even as a virgin) and I am not I rather sit on the couch and watch tv/moves or watch him or myself play videogames.

&amp;#x200B;

After 3 years of dating he doesn't understand why we cant have sex. he told me at one point marriage is just a paper and he doesn't understand why he should have to pay 1000s of dollars to ""show me he loves me all the way"" I don't think he understands what it means to be Ace and I don't thing he ever looked it up because just taking 20 minutes to look it up he would get it a little bit.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just frustrated because for the past year and a half he has been pushing me a lot more to do things sexually and then gets angry when I say no. He has never hit me but he has jokingly (although the more I think about it I don't it is a joke) called me a bitch several times after saying no. It makes me feel like he just wants me for Sex and I am angry he wont stop pushing me to do things I don't want to do.

But I do my research. I feel like since I am not part of these groups, people would lash at me at me and tell me that my books are bad representation. 

Where I live, mental health is poorly understood and it is very anti lgbtq so I am afraid of writting about such topics but I see way too many crappy books about my own country about people who know nothing, and bad representation about mental health and lgbtq, I find it stupid for my characters to only be heteronormative, when clearly some animal species are lgbtq too. But I am not sure if I should write in my own language since english is kind of my second. I don't feel quite confident enough but it would target a larger audience. 

I feel like people in my country would hate me since people are very cold and have very judgy attitude towards anything they don't understand - LGBTQ, METNAL ILLNESS, ECCENTRISM AND WEIRD TASTES-and tend to get agressive towards it, due to my adhd I have quriky behaviors which cause frustration and not once or twice have been the victim of peer agression, assault and psychological and verbal bullying for pure fun of the agressor who can afford it since I can't or couldn't do anything to defend my self and had a few people to fight against, which was not only unfair but also terryfying. My ADHD and certain fatal tragic flaws I have also make me an unlikeable person which makes sense for me to write characters who could be on the spectrum of lgbtq or have a certain disorder and have liking for certain topics and animation to cope with the huge hole in my heart and forced loneliness upon me

i do not want to show my face and for people to know who I am though. I just want to sell books and inspire people and for them to think my books are interesting. If they dislike them that is okay too, I can't make everyone like me or love my writting, and I may sound cringy in english which is what I fear but I see many americans on youtube having huge ego and self esteem despite not knowing how to speak their first language and making tons of gramatical mistakes, and not knowing the difference between words like their,there and they're and using them interchangeably makes me cringe a little. But I know I make mistakes too, and we're all people and we all make mistakes.

I don't know what to do, I have the main plots but many issues like, should I publish it, where can I find an editor, who would want my books, what cover should it have, who would buy a book from a author who is not popular or cool, people thinking I am crazy and my stories are lame bother me

if you have any suggestions or explanations please share. I am kind of scared to write people of colour and lgbtq or people with mental illness purely because of my country which hates such people and treats them badly, and my country is known to be a bad one so even though I am not black or asian I have still heard racist and weird remarks  about my country when I was  on visits to France, Germany and Austria because of school, like we are all poor and smell,we don't know what smartphones are and live like it is 1970's and have old and outdated view of the world, that the women don't know what a condom is and freely make children,that we steal food, that it steals money from Europe, that it has no culture, and other kinds of bullshit, it made me sad.

I am apprehensive, but am trying to keep an open mind. the problem is anal sex makes me REALLY uncomfortable. enough that I get disgusted or queasy if I see it in porn. I avoid it at all costs. I can’t watch it. I might be willing to try but I don’t know how I could ever get comfortable enough to even do that. I hate the idea. 

I want him to feel satisfied and be able to explore with me but it feels like a hard limit, especially since he set a hard limit with butt stuff for himself (ie. during blowjobs)

Please read the first part first to understand it better.

So when I found out my boyfriend had been jerking off with some random guy on instagram, I feel cheated that he's been e-flirting behind my back especially when i've looked on their messages; they are mostly sending nudes, dick pics, and even videos of them jerking off aswell as how much they love each other. I'm not homophobic or anything but cheating is cheating so it doesn't matter if he's been into with a guy or a girl and also for the fact that exploring his sexuality doesn't mean a free pass to cheating. It's perfectly okay if he ever comes out as bi before his death.

So i chatted the guy on instagram and informed him about his death from covid as my boyfriend never told him this before which left him worried and confused. He was shocked to find out he's dead and said which is why he hasn't replied for months now.

He also apologized to me as he loves my boyfriend but he didn't know that he's in a relationship with me. We chatted a little more for a while about this and after saying goodbye, I then deleted my boyfriend's instagram so that I can move on with my life.",0,0,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,nsfw,UPDATE: My [15F] boyfriend [17M] died but the I found out he's been jerking off with some random guy [18M] on instagram,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/l9esm0/update_my_15f_boyfriend_17m_died_but_the_i_found/,promo_adult_nsfw,3.0

We dated for about a year before we got married. Everything was completely fine then, we were going at it like animals, spend hours kissing in the park, and there was so much love. He felt like my soulmate, and still does in a way but... Towards the wedding, and especially after, his libido just dropped to zero. I learned very quickly that his love language is not sexual interaction, as it is mine, and he is fine with just hugging and holding hands. Which, if I would have known, I would have heavily considered marrying him. 

I was really confused at first, and hurt as more and more I'd get rejected when I tried to initiate sex.  I don't even need good sex, like just something, or like any intimate activity past a peck or a hug. Of course I know the honey moon phase can't last forever but... He has never once initiated anything, but I thought it's fine because I'm a person with a high sex drive and he said he liked that about me. I just can't take being rejected anymore and basically have a sexless marriage at the age of 24. Pretty much every time I ask, which I have stopped asking because I know it's fruitless, I am rejected. And if he even feels like I am trying to initiate something, like if I start touching him just a little more firm, he just goes distant and cold until I stop. We've only had sex once out of the last three month, due to my basically begging and being very clearly upset about it. Before that it was only once every one or two months. It also just contains like no passion. We used to spend hours in bed, but now once he's done, it's done. No kissing, no foreplay, nothing. It was just to appease me or something. I am so unsatisfied its uncomfortable. Yet, he still says how beautiful I am and how much he loves me and loves his life with me, despite not even really kissing or doing anything. I believe him but...

I just don't know how long I can stay, as I really can not feel loved/close without being sexually active with my partner. I don't feel attractive, wanted, nothing anymore. I just feel like a roommate and constantly feel like I'm nagging when I keep trying to explain to him HOW important having a healthy sex life is to me and if there's anything we can do to bring fix it for our relationship to continue. He says he'll try and that's he sorry for making me feel that way, but that just equates to like kissing me for more than a second maybe twice in the next few hours after the discussion, then nothing until I break down again a couple weeks later. He just says it’s not a big deal, why don't you just go jack off or something to feel better and he doesn't understand what it's like for me since his libido has always been very low. But sex, kissing, etc is not about the pleasure for me, it's how I feel love. 

Now I'm just depressed when I see other couples having what I don't and fantasizing about sleeping/being with other people everyday. I just am not seeing my future with him anymore if this can't be fixed, what should I do? I still love him of course, but I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel and I don't want to cheat. I feel a bit stupid for wanting to leave because of sex, but it's more like I'm just hurt he doesn't even care enough to try to meet me halfway when I purposely use his love language (happiness, cuddles, and quality time) daily.",0,0,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,nsfw,Should I (24F) leave my Japanese husband(23M) because a lack of sex?,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/l9ewg1/should_i_24f_leave_my_japanese_husband23m_because/,promo_adult_nsfw,20.0

This is hard to talk about for me, so I’m looking for advice and guidance. 

My boyfriend (m23) and I (f21) have been dating for a year now. I love him a lot, and feel that this is a great relationship that is going to last. Though recently, we have not been sleeping together often (not even once a month). We used to about once a week, but we both are essential workers and the pandemic has increased our workload, making us more tired: I think that’s normal! I’m actually on the ace spectrum, so this doesn’t bother me, at least until a couple weeks ago. 

I was asking my boyfriend what he likes (ex. lingerie, toys) because I was think of getting us something for Xmas. He became very defensive and upset? I had asked what he liked/would like in bed, and he said “whatever you like”. I found this answer slightly annoying since I want to do something special for him, since our preferences in the bedroom aren’t the same (he likes things rougher than I, and we trade off/find a balance), and so I clarified that I’m wanting to do something nice for him that he’ll like. But he kept insisting that I should do what I like, and he walked away saying “I’m not dealing with this”. I was so confused: I feel like I’m missing something huge here? Why would he be upset? 
When we met I was a virgin (in the heteronormative sense), and he was not, he is my first. When he was younger he had been very sexually adventurous. It should also be noted that he has bought things for me before. 

I talked to him again a week later saying that I was confused about that conversation. He had said that he feels bad that he’s tired all the time, and he appreciates that I don’t pressure him, but that was the end of the conversation. he wouldn’t talk any more about it. I tried asking the same question again, but he became defensive again and just reiterated “whatever you enjoy”, like, I don’t know what I enjoy I’m new to all of this. Now I’m feeling insecure. I’m concerned that he may not enjoy sleeping with me and isn’t telling me. When I have tried to initiate recently, he usually turns me down (which doesn’t bother me, what concerns me is that he seems emotional about something and I don’t understand why).
Are these signs that he doesn’t like me in bed, but won’t tell me? He tells me I’m attractive and great etc, but I’m just so confused.

I am fully aware that I have this calendar in my room, but before I joined any meeting I checked whether the calendar was visible. If it was visible I would turn my laptop so it would just be out of view.

So I was doing as I described for a couple of weeks until a friend from my class messaged me with a picture...

As you would expect I get a picture of my camera with the 18+ calendar 100% clear in view. I immediately turned my camera off and thought to myself how that was even possible. Well, apparently MS Teams preview doesn't show the whole camera which I thought it did. I also interacted/spoke up a decent amount so my bedroom was seen pretty often I imagine.

I guess you could say I found out about the camera backgrounds setting the hard way (pun intended).

Eventually we had sex which after he turned around and jokingly said ‘don’t go catching feelings for me’ and I took that as him wanting things to be causal so I explained I recently had gotten out of a relationship and life was too busy for anything more. Since we have been sleeping together for 3 weeks, he started to stay over nearly every night, becoming super affectionate (randomly kissing me or when he left for work not wanting to go and coming back to say ‘bye’ a second time to kiss me again), making me my morning coffees, buying me small items like milk that I previously mentioned needing, joking around about ‘loving’ me, calling me ‘babe’ because he knows it makes me cringe to wind me up and bring up he doesn’t want me to sleep with someone else. I feel confused because I don’t understand if he is intentionally trying to play games or if he’s just scared of being up front but between all the the above and then him constantly going hot and cold it started to feel tedious because I don’t understand the point of trying to push something casual but have him do things to complicate that dynamic. I ended up saying I just wanted to be friends, which he said he respected how honest I was and that he’d love to because I was such a ‘caring and down to earth girl- which is rare’ but later that night when he came round he started trying to be affectionate again which made things tense and ended up with him leaving my house. 
After that he didn’t respond to my text for a few days and when he did I confronted him about everything I have mentioned in this post. He said he wanted time to properly reply to each part of the message and then didn’t reply for about a week, which was that he was being sarcastic about liking me and didn’t want a relationship because he was happy with the way he was. Which I found a bit weird because I didn’t imply I wanted anything serious from him, I just asked why he felt the need to complicate things if he was getting sex without all the other bullshit. Now we have gone from messaging all day and then having him stay over nearly everyday to getting a response every couple of days. I enjoy his company and friendship and I’m left feeling confused if he’s not wanting anything why haven’t I seen him for over a week and taking a day or two to get a reply?
Just to clarify where I stand- I’m a pretty easy going person that goes with the flow. He made it clear he didn’t want anything and I’m not going to lie to myself that ‘it could be something more’. I’m not shut off to dating at a slow pace but I’m also not going to invest in that unless a guy makes it clear he wants that.

The cleanup process then began. I called my younger brother into the room to assist me with fetching towels and cleaning products. The remote was eventually deep cleaned as were my fingers and anywhere else the excrement landed.

3 years ago I had an affair with a married man (All the of us are gay dudes). He was my friend and at the beginning it was something ""allowed"" by his partner because the guy traveled a lot and was not home enough to fullfill my friend's sexual needs, to say it somehow.

This lasted for about a year until the husband got jealous and suspected (correctly, if I am being honest) that our relationship was becoming more romantic than sexual. It was not an easy ending, I didn't want to break up with who by that point I considered my boyfriend, my friend wanted something open,  etc, etc. A lot of drama.

Point is, all ended, they reminded as a couple and I got out of the picture.

Our actual problem started 5 months ago, in the peak of the pandemic. My friend and his husband are both essential workers (and so is most of their social circle) and they were having trouble finding a babysitter to take care of their 2 years old adopted son. Thats when my friend decided to call me, the only work-at-home guy he knows, and asked for my help.

I like kids, and have the time so, why not, let's help our health care workes in need (Okay, that's a lie, I am still in love with this dude and he could ask me to throw me into a river and I will do it) The first rule of all this was that obviously his husband couldn't know , because well, he hates me and the fact that my friend is even speaking to me would probably end in chaos and break up.

Our little plan has worked perfectly till now but I am starting to feel really bad. I love his child and I want to help my friend, but I can't shake of the feeling that I am in the ""lover"" position all over again, hiding things from the husband, meeting in places to exchange the child, etc. Also, I fear that if this blows up in our faces, the one who will suffer is the kid, specially if his dads' divorce.  My sister, who knows everything, believes the same and thinks I am being an asshole to both the child and the husband for having accepted the deal on first place. My friend things I am just being paranoid and is sure nothing will go wrong.

AITA?

Edit to add:  The husband believes the kid is with one of my friend's cousins. She helps him keep the lie and has sometimes picked up the baby to make a good facade.

I do not know if the law of attraction exists or if it is some bulls\*it but for me it is true that what I avoid, I attract, I avoided bullies and abuse and gossiping and somehow the more I avoided it and the more afraid I was the more I encountered it. So in my language there is a saying that as long as idiots exists, smart asses would also exists and this is true for me and it kind of hurts my ego and feels like  a punch in the gut. 

How can i appear threating if there is nothing threating about me. I do not have a pe\*is and I am not six feet tall. Even though girls can be threating, I do not have that sass and agression normal alpha women have. I avoid people and give awkward smiles but people either misunderstand me and assume the worst in me, or understand me and take advantage of me...which is why I avoid socializing and mingling with other people since everyone is a jerk. I want to be more proactive but I am not sure if that makes sense

I do not understand why I have to be everyone's martyr. People do not like me and while we all have flaws I am just too awkward to be charismatic and likeable as a girl or well I am no longer a girl but a woman but I do not feel like a proper woman, since proper women have curves, are bad, mean sassy, wear make up, while I am a bit on th ugly side and guys assume I am a femboy, guy in woman's clothes. I used to love crossdressing as a guy but since my country is very anti lgbtq and very anti mental health that attracts bullying, actually anything that does not follow the status quo attracts bullying, if you are a bit on the poorer side and can't afford good clothes or good phone like me through out 1-7th grade this will attract bullying, if you are too loud you are a clown and people use you to make fun of you, if you are too quiet, you don't say anything which angers people and they bully you, so whether you are loud or quiet, if you are too this or that you will be bullied unfortunetly.

Which is why I clung to one or two people who managed to become my friends but left me for dead.

I am on my own but not by choicde but because people shout at me and tell me to go away and feel manly and tough when I do walk away. SO yeah, walking away is a stupid advise if anything. Being alone also attracts harassment and I am too adhd to understand the neuroptical normal why. I do not understand why I can't go on my own to buy my self clothes or food without encountering a creep or someone who hates me. I am not even a bad person to be hated. In fact the people who stole, gossiped and ruined other people's cars and used barbaric words are among the most liked people in the city and are very very respected. They don't understand that they're giving anxiety and they think my panic attacks are personal attack towards them somehow and attack me even more

I am a bit ashamed to be me since I always wanted to help the bullied and be this hero girl that guys fall for but instead I was the weird quirky bullied girl no one likes, while the cool girl who helps the bullied became someone else, a bit dumber than me but more agressive which makes me afraid since this creates the idea that I have to bully in order to protect my self and I do not want to become a bully, to become the same monster that led me to sui\*ide and haunts me. People don't understand when they annoy me, I rarely curse or insult but when I do people make a big deal out of it and love to blame me for everything , even if it is outside of my control (For example some people in school blamed me for the color of the sky) and while they're idiots they do not think of them selves as idiots and have social power over me which I hate. Since people have friends and I don't they can treat me like trash, but since I have no social power and I couldn't do anything besides taking the bullying since I saw that protecting my self against it led to a lot of trouble and didn't change much

I know reddit is a site made by guys for guys but going to the gym is not enough to make me threatining. I no longer wish to be harmless. People terrorize you for fun and you live in constant fear. This is not a way to live. You can be the most emotionally fragile guy in the world but if you have muscles people don't dare to touch you. (Personal experience-Even the biggest losers of guys managed to succeed in life just by changing their posture and gaining muscles, unfortunetely for women I haven't seen the same effect happening)So for guys it is easy.  And don't you whine in the comments that it is not easy. But for me? I could be beaten up, I could be raped, I could be stalked. Women in general experience much more unwanted attention on the street than males, especially during the night and are blamed if something happens to them but the average woman can't protect her self against one man, and let's not talk about a gang of them.

So how can I change my personality into one that is worthy of respect, is sexy, is likeable but no one would dare to insult her? I feel like I have to become completely cold and b\*tchy in order to gain this respect since if I will not feel okay in my skin if I become sl\*tty normal alpha girl that parties and insults everyone. I still want to be my self and not lose my self but also gain respect, which is hard since men assume most women are stupid by default or less than them, especially in the workplace, even if a woman has years of experience she is still judged while a man can have a zero experience and no one judges him, at least this is what I have seen

TLTR: How can a woman go from harmless to threathning and gain respect by men and women, and also be likeable and charismatic? Please share tips that are not related to exercise or posture or clothes, I mean like improvement on the personality, because certain types of people are smart asses and attack naive idiots like me for their own enterteiment and I no longer want to be cheap martyr toy for everyone to laugh at. I hate being laughed at, I am not a bad person to be insulted or terrorized just because I have anxiety. I work on my anxiety and on my flaws since people misunderstand me and attack me and since they don't like me, they use me as a toy to beat up and put their insecurities on and project their problems onto when I am a human too, I have emotions too, and the abuse is overwhelming and draining and it makes me sui\*cidal, the problem is that a lot of jerks encouter me and I can't contain or harness my empathy well which makes people use and abuse me, how can I change that, if I can't change anyone, how can I change my self into a more respectable and strong woman who no one would dare to insult or hit or joke with or bully, but instead love and respect?",0,0,socialskills,t5_2r275,nsfw,"What social skills should be used against people who are, I am not sure how to translate it in english but like, very smart ass, very tricky, stealthy, people who do bad things and are really good at getting away with it, while also hurting you along the process?

I am very keen on efficiency. Anything i do in my life, i try to accomplish with as little energy as possible. In other words I am lazy.

Bit of a read, sorry.

&amp;#x200B;

they/them pronouns btw.

&amp;#x200B;

My spouse is a cis/het male. When we first got married, I didn't realize I was trans at the time. I was actually unlearning a lot of childhood ingrained transphobia and homophobia back then, so it never got anywhere near crossing my mind. The closest I had got was a girlfriend when I was 14 that my parents staged an intervention at church for. Yea, not anywhere on my mind. Opposite in fact, I popped out a kid for the guy. I hated being pregnant. Love the kid more than anyone, even myself.  Just, hated the way he got here. Talk about a massive kick in right in some dysphoria right there. I just didn't know that's what had been eating me about my body. And I sure as hell didn't realize I was trans on top of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast-forward about 1 1/2-2 years, and we became polyam. We broadened our reach socially online (we weren't ready for irl yet) I found an online community that helped me open up a bit. I discovered I wasn't as straight as I thought (demisexual, panromantic) and during this time I met a transgender person whom I grew close to. I started researching and looking to the LGBTQ community, and the trans community specifically, so I could understand what their life all entailed. Eventually me and this person drifted apart (naturally as people do, nothing big happened) but I realized more and more every day that I was personally resonating with what I was learning, and it had nothing to do with another person anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

And about... not quite two years ago it finally hit me. I'm trans.

&amp;#x200B;

My spouse was supportive for the most part. His biggest thing was, ""Ok but if you get a dick. That's a deal breaker."" He also still has yet to this day to use my pronouns or chosen name. He says its habits of his, seeing that he married a woman and knew me by my birthname for so long, and he isn't sure if he can break the habits. Maybe one day. But He also told me why he didn't want me to get surgery. He sadly experienced sexual assault as a teen thanks to some bullies in HS, and he is very uncomfortable around other penises. I can understand that. I had my own demons like those. I figured, ok fair enough.

&amp;#x200B;

But as years went on, even with some social transitioning (I had to stealth hard for a while, bigoted family), my depression was getting worse, my disgust with my own body got worse. I cried during periods (crying that was extra, unrelated to the period hormones) I refused to look at myself in the mirror. I avoided getting naked unless I had to (showering, changing, etc) and yes, this affected our sex life. I started extreme dieting (500cal/day) to do SOMETHING to get my body to look different. Backslid. Felt like a failure so that dug the dagger deeper. I developed panic disorder from a random, no trigger nocturnal panic attack (ever wake up feeling like you're literally dying?) and kind of crashed medically and mentally. This wasn't the first time.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally a couple doctors mentioned dysphoria. (My kidneys weren't doing what they were supposed to, they're fine just being ornery. But that's why I was around doctors in that moment of my life. For context.) I remembered researching it before. I knew everyone could suffer from dysphoria, not just transgender individuals. But that the dysphoria could make an already tense life as a trans person that much worse. I was like WOW, I found the answer again. Brought it up to my therapist, went through all the steps and things, self searching, discovery, etc. She had me look into dysphoria again, and one night in the middle of the night while I was researching the same procedures for the, idk, 1000000th time in a row, I made the choice that I wanted surgery.

&amp;#x200B;

a bit TMI So skip this paragraph to avoid body parts talk if you want. but the specifics are, I'm going for a buried rff phalloplasty with UL, NO vagenectomy. Not sure about scroto yet. An ED, and top surgery. A reduction or full removal, haven't decided on that yet either. But I got time, its gonna be awhile before I get close to THAT part. I'm just starting with T at the moment, then will see how I feel once I get where I want with the T. Because I intend to come off it eventually and let my bodies natural PCOS-induced overproduction keep me balanced in the ""middle of genders"" perse.

&amp;#x200B;

Now me and my spouse had problems unrelated to the trans thing that had already starting bursting open the bubble I had growing in me, Then the trans thing and the moment it got to a point where I mentioned surgery he FLIPPED. Went off about how you dont cater to the disease (dysphoria) by giving in (surgery) and a bunch of other transphobic rhetoric. (He's since calmed down, it was an initial reaction I guess, hasnt repeated.) and I finally got a point where I calmly walked up to him one day and said, ""I want a divorce, neither of us are happy. We're fundamentally different people."" We got real close to ending it. We got to a point where we looked at each other like, yea. I guess this is it. We were talking about it calmly, daily, like pals. I had one foot out the door. Only thing stopping me in the end was all the stuff in the world piling up, it was too much to add that too. So we put it off.

&amp;#x200B;

But some time passed and after a few long talks, we decided to give it one more go. Like a really good, full revamp of our life and how we spend it together, and how we raise our family. So now we're planning like the divorce isn't happening anytime soon. I told him I'm not sweeping 7 years of problems under the rug, but, let's see how it goes. He told me very clearly, he isn't sure if he can handle me having a penis. Which I understood. I have my own genital prefs, I get it. At least he wasn't invalidating me as much anymore. We are polyam, so I have no problems with him finding intimacy elsewhere if he needs/wants to. But I'm doing it either way. I'm tired of feeling like I'm living my life in someone elses body.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to the second half of 2020. I came out officially. (To most people) it was received about as well as you'd expect from most of my family. But I finally got an appointment for a consult at the transgender clinic at the teaching hospital in the state I live in. I had to book it almost 6 months out! But the day finally arrived (last week), and I went and ... it was one of the single most validating experiences I have ever had in my life, let alone in a doctors office (lots of medical issues, I see doctors a lot) I got put on T that same visit, I didn't even have to beg. (its typically really hard for most transgender people to get any trans specific care without a looooot of hoops.)

&amp;#x200B;

He even drove me himself, it was almost a 2 hour drive so it wasn't just something he did because it was convenient. I see him trying over these past few months, I will absolutely give credit where it is due. (I hope my trying has been as equally validating to him) And on top of that, the appointment itself was over two hours, and he didn't even complain.

&amp;#x200B;

He's really trying guys. And now he needs help. He researched stuff himself (He HATES reading, but he researched stuff unprompted, I'm so proud Q.Q) but sadly there aren't a lot of resources for someone in his position. I do not have the spoons to walk him through this from his POV, I'm figuring it out myself. And I feel terrible at that. He has a therapist but hes not able to open up to her about some things. (hes getting better!)

But it wasn't always that way. We have been together for two years, and broke up for the first time this November primarily due to distance. The break was from his end, but we had a fairly amicable break up. Our relationship up to that point was as good as it could be, we never fought, he just found himself to be unhappy because of the distance. 

During our breakup, I was told by one of his best friends that he had cheated on me. I confronted him about this, and he denied the accusations saying he was nothing but loyal to me during our time together. He and his other friends have since booted the other friend out of the friend group. This event will come up again later.

During that time, I had decided to go on a spontaneous date with a guy I had met online. It turned out to be every person's worst nightmare and I was raped. I didn't go to the police or hospital because after it happened I felt like it was my fault for putting myself in that situation. I have since been in therapy trying to learn to not blame myself for another person's actions. This really impacted me and there are a lot of things about that night that I have blocked from my memory as a way to cope including the exact date. I try to forget about it as much as possible. On December 19th, I visited my obgyn to make sure I was not pregnant, and get an STD test to make sure this man did not give me anything. Both the pregnancy test and STD test came back negative.

A few days later my boyfriend was back in town. He asked if we could hang out and after our dinner he could tell I was off so I confessed to what had happened to me back in November. He apologized and told me he felt like this was his fault, everything was going to be okay and invited me to stay over his place that night. I reassured him it was not his fault, and slept over his house that night. 

He was going to be home for two weeks and asked me to spend the holidays with him. During that time we started to have sex again and I told him that I was no longer on birth control and that he needed to pull out. On December 24th, we were having sex and he did not pull out. I immediately started to panic saying I could get pregnant. He was kind of hurt by my reaction but also acknowledged that he was not thinking right in the moment and that we should go get Plan B ASAP. The next day we went to CVS and I took it that day.

Despite taking Plan B something inside of me told me I was pregnant. I have no idea what but I just knew that this was it. The rest of our trip went fairly well until I came home to leave a surprise for him on his pillow while he was out with a friend. To my surprise he was still at his house, and seemed shocked to see me when I walked in. He told me he had something to tell me. We were not together and he had a date with another girl planned that night. I was shocked. Up to that point he was telling me he loved me, we spent Christmas and Christmas Eve together, he wanted to finally meet my best friend. He was posting photos of me online. I had thought we were together. But he told me he couldn't get over what happened to me during November and that it was my fault we can't be together. He asked me if I was raped or just had sex I regretted. I told him no, I told this man no I was not ready and he kept going. I told him again I was not ready and he continued to keep going so I bursted into tears and cried the whole time he did what he did to me. My boyfriend argued that because I did not physically fight him and that he was able to get my pants off that it must not have been rape. I was shocked and left. I thought he would of supported me through this.

Comes to find out the next day, he did not end up going on a date with said girl and asked if I could come over to talk. He told me he wants to spend time with me because he loves me but cannot be with me because he is having trouble getting over what happened. I understood because not everyone handles this situation the same, and if he can not get over it I do not want him to stay with me. We had spent a couple more days together and the night before he left he went through my phone and saw that I had been flirting with a guy via messenger on December 7th while we were not together. I told him I no longer talk to anyone and have deleted all dating apps since but he flipped out. He called me stupid and told me that I never learn and to get out of his house. 

A few days later after he left he messaged me apologizing for everything. He said that this has brought out the worst in him and at the end of the day he wants to be with me. It just hurts him knowing that his worst nightmare happened to me. I thought all was good with us and then I took a pregnancy test and it came out positive. I was shocked because I took Plan B. When I told him he was not mad but just needed sometime to process. He still was being fairly nice to me considering the surprise. The next day he called me to have a talk about what we should do and voiced his opinion saying that we should not keep the baby because the timing is not right. He is about to be deployed and would like to be able to be there for the birth of his child. He told me he wants kids with me in the future but not right now. I started crying and said I understood but I didn't know if I could go through with it. He told me he would be there with me through the whole thing.

Later that night his whole demeanor completely flipped. He spent the majority of the day telling me he loved me and that we will get through this together. And then all of the sudden he was really irritable and told me he wanted nothing to do with me ever again and that the baby wasn't his. I kept telling him it was, that I had not been with anyone else since we broke up (except for my rapist) and I have had an obgyn confirm that I was not pregnant prior to him coming home. He said that he can not trust me and that I could have been sleeping with anyone since slept with someone in November. I reminded him that I did not sleep with someone, that I was RAPED. He just kept saying the baby is not his. I told him its unfair of him to treat me like this, especially when he slept with someone a few days after our break up (this was the event from before and  his friend confused us being together during that time) and even tried to go on a date during the holidays while we were spending time together. Our relationship is a complete mess and I want to let it go but I also don't know what to do. This is extremely toxic and its mentally draining me. I don't know if this is how it always will be because it wasn't like this before or if this is just a road block that many people find hard to get over.

While we were there, we weighed ourselves on the last day.  I weighed almost 200lbs (I’m 5’10). When we got back home, we were looking on tinder together, and as we were swiping he saw a girl who had her weight in her bio. It said “I weigh 180 and I’m 5’5 if you like chubby girls”. My boyfriend said “I just thought of a horrible joke”

Of course, I relentlessly encouraged him to say it because I wanted to know what he was thinking, and he said “she weighs less than you so if we meet up I might just leave you for her”. I told him that I thought that was really mean and cried about it and he apologized many times and tried to explain himself, but I can’t get it out of my head. He’s never made a joke like this before, but he does point out girls that he thinks are hot when we are out in public and they are typically much more petite and thin than I am. 

So I talked to him about it again recently and told him why it kept bothering me, and he just kept saying sorry and explaining himself repetitively. When we FaceTimed later that day, I was trying to do some adult things with him and I felt really insecure and talked to him about it. I only brought it up because I’m not generally insecure when being sexual, especially with a longer-term partner. 

The whole time we talked he was very visibly upset and distant. I could tell he was getting annoyed so I stopped talking about the “joke” and I tried to talk to him about other, lighter things. He said “I don’t know how we can come back to a good call after that” and we hung up shortly after saying goodbye. 

Now, he won’t text me if I don’t text him first, responds way later than he used to, only responds in like 3-4 words, doesn’t “feel like” FaceTiming me when I ask, and says “maybe” about making plans for a couple months from now (i.e. my college graduation). 

I’m just really confused on why he’s become so distant after making a rude comment about my body, especially after he invited me to meet his entire family for Christmas.

When they do so, I just diffuse the situation and disappoint them by telling them I’m asexual, thus I have no interest whatsoever of riding their micro penis. With the boobs thing, If they ask before I tell them about my sexuality, I tell them I’m busty. If after, I tell them I’m flat, and message them in caps FLAT IS JUSTICE!

I’m ashamed to say it, but that was the first time I ever jacked off, and I still feel terrible. After crying myself to sleep, I blocked her and I never heard from her again.

When I joined back, I changed my name to some another dude who wasn't there in the class. I didn't care about my attendance at that moment because there was no way I could face the aftermath of that shit.

Some friends texted me after the class dying to know what the hell I was doing and have never wanted to dig a hole and die in it as much as I did today.

**TL;DR**\- I had accidentally taken the link of an NSFW subreddit that was filled with inappropriate pictures and posted it in the Zoom public chat. I then left the meeting and joined back under a different name and have never been so embarrassed my entire life.

**EDIT:** LMAO my entire comments section is filled with people who want to know the sub, so I'm telling you. The only reason I left it out was so that I didn't have to mark it as NSFW but I'm guessing now I gotta do it so... It was r/gonewild

I am also fairly naive about certain things.  A female employee has developed a pattern of coming to work late, going directly to the bathroom, and staying in there for five or six minutes before starting her shift.  This is a woman who used to be funny and joyous, a pleasure to be around.  Now she is quiet and sullen.  She still does her job okay, but she is a changed person.

So, to the question: is she doing something involving drug use in there?  Is she having a recurring women's problem?  I guess the best person to answer this would be a female addict in recovery.  I know it is not makeup or making herself presentable; she is not the type, and looks fine when she arrives.  As for drugs, I don't even know what it could be. Snorting cocaine? Injecting something?  I know it isn't weed; there is no odor.

I fully accept that people have personal problems that are none of my business.  Indeed, if one of my people used drugs in their free time I have no problem with that as long as it doesn't affect their work. From a cold business standpoint, this employee is at maybe 80% of her former value.

Also I'm on mobile so sorry for any formatting issues. 

On to the FU. So at the time, I (17F at that time) and my bf (17m at the time) had just started to have sex.  We were responsible about it, of course, and made sure to use a condom every time. We always made sure to turn the tv on before getting down to it so that no one would hear us or whatever. When we were done, we would wrap it in lots of tissues and then throw it away once we were leaving the room.  That's where we fucked up.  

One day, after bf had gone home, my dad came up to me with a weird look on his face and said ""can you go clean the tv remote, clean it as if it is covered in radioactive waste"" (yes, he really used that phrase. I remember as if it happened yesterday). Immediately I run downstairs and look and low and behold, we forgot to throw out the tissue with the condom inside.   Even worse, some, ahem, fluid had leaked out of it and onto our tv remote.  I cannot describe the embarrassment of this incident in words. And it gets even worse because after I cleaned the remote, I went back to my dad and had the audacity to say, ""I don't know what the big deal was, I just spilled some water"" and he gives me a look and says ""I know what water looks like, OP. That wasn't it."" Mortifying. 

Anyway, thankfully he never brought it up again.  We still have that remote and I am also still dating that boy (I never told him about the incident). Sometimes I wonder if my dad thinks of that horrible day every time he uses that remote.  I know I do.  


TL; DR: Dad discovered his daughter was having sex because a leaking condom was found on the tv remote.

EDIT: hey guys, just wanted to say I'm really enjoying reading every one else's similar stories haha ... makes me feel better about it. Also, a lot of people are confused about how the condom ended up on the remote.

Despite that, the facade's fallen and now it feels like I just have a roommate that clings and wants sex occasionally.

I told him before we even started dating official what I could offer and what I needed in this relationship: Things like, I'm a sub and I want a Dom; my privacy is sacred, don't blab out the secrets I confide in you, and I like spaces of solitude; I'll fight for you without hesistation, but I've gone my whole life fighting for myself and I need to know you'll protect me and not leave me hanging.  Everything else is adaptable in my mind.  He excitedly agreed and assured me he was all of the things I needed.  

While we were dating, yeah he was my Dom and he did accommodate my privacy, in turn, I opened up and trusted him more.  We were growing more aware of each others needs; I encouraged him to go socializing whenever he felt like it, regardless if I was with him or not; we split chores and bills evenly; started a successful business together, you get the picture.

Marriage time rolls by and suddenly every private thing I confide in him about, his family knows the next damn day and start bombarding me with unsolicited advise.  It isn't until I sit him down and tell him how violated my trust in him feels now, that he ""stops,"" but even when I ask and he says he has told no one of the confidential things I told him, I still hear people I talk to mention things they are not suppose to know on occasion.  So now I'm mum about things I want to share with only him because I don't know if he takes it seriously.  

Five years into this marriage and I'm STILL battling with his mom's lack of boundaries.  Even though he hates how overbearing she can be, he does nothing to put his foot down about it; I have to and it falls on deaf ears.  

Sex is now more like a chore so I don't neglect his needs, and even though he initiates since I'm not good at it, he's dropped any want of being dominant and I end up having to take the lead in everything.  When I brought it up and asked if he could try to satisfy me like he used to and not just meet the bare minimum climax, he says he will then never follows through.

I end up pulling most of the weight in chores, handyman tasks, honey-do's, and bills and he only ever puts in as much effort as I push him to do.  I ask him if he's okay, if he's satisfied with our life and chipper as he can be, he is happy, and he knows I'm not happy, but the only things he tries to do to cheer me up are fleeting emotional support and that won't repair the bigger problems.

He did promise he would protect me as much as I would him.  I have protected him, from crazy exes and all.  I can hear it in his tone and his non-answers though, that if I were ever in conflict and needed his help...he may be in my corner after all.  And that is one thing I've yearned for the most in my life over everything else, but never had...someone to protect me if I needed help.  He promised he would, in the beginning.  Now I doubt the one person I should be able to rely on to do so, will fill that void.  That is by far the cut that hurts the most in all of this.

I feel trapped now.  I've slipped back into depression.  In the meantime, our business has flourished despite the 2020 setbacks; we both work hard at our jobs and work well together...only when we're at work.  Everyone talks like we're the perfect couple, but I couldn't feel more hopeless and lost right now if I tried.

I made a commitment with him that I intend to keep, but goddammit why did he fool me like this, put up a front up until we got it locked in, when I worked so hard to fulfill his needs for so long?!

I don't cheat and will never stoop that low.  I don't care about advice.  I just needed to say something, somewhere, because it falls to the wayside where it matters.

But first, some backstory. 

Monday my friend and I decided we should fly down to Miami for a few days to get away from winter hell where we live. We got here tuesday morning and spent the first few minutes putting our stuff away. My friend and I originally wanted to road trip down here and bring our weed and shrooms but decided to fly instead and since it was so last minute and we barely prepared. His mom sort of stepped in for our lazy dumbasses and booked our flights and hotel in South Beach. We get to our hotel and my friend and I are heavy stoners and not drinkers whatsoever, but I've always known my limits and handle myself well when drunk, my friend on the other hand isnt as ...containable as myself and the first thing we did out of our hotelwas look for weed. Which we found within like 5 minutes of walking around. Lit. (Weve gone through an ounce in the last two days 😨) The rest of the day was us walking around and seeing the usual stuff and shopping around. Now, it being vacation We started drinking fairly early on top of finding out that Miami has better weed than a state where it's fricking legal. I had a nice buzz going and we decided we were going to pregame and go to a club. Not just any club, my friend wanted to go to a strip club. Hes a young guy in his early 20s and I'm 26 but despite myself having lived with, had sex with and partied with a few strippers throughout my life, I had never actually been to an actual strip club for the purpose of entertainment for a night or payed for a stripper or sex, it's not my thing and I only genuinely date very innocent suburban girls instead of rowdy city ones. I chose to pregame with modelos and my friend unwisely chose Heineken and when we felt buzzed enough we went to a club to finally get a taste of that side of the lifestyle. Mainly to enjoy a fun first time experience with my best friend where money wasnt gonna be an object (So we thought). We didnt know any of the clubs and found out the one we wanted to go to was actually closed that day but there was a gentleman's club nearby according to our uber. We figured that was the same as a nightclub/strip club and at this point we were drunk and just wanted to drink more and party with some cute girls. We payed an exorbitant amount to get into this club and let me tell you. It was worth every bit ladies and gents. I'd never been in such a luxurious nightclub with SO MANY GORGEOUS 50/10 girls and barely any other guys. It was heaven for us. The music and the vibes were great. I ended up getting a private lap dance with a gorgeous super model worthy girl who ended up telling me that for a few hundred more I could literally do ANYTHING wink wink squeeze squeeze (my penis). This girl was so unbelievably trance inducing to my weak caveman brain that I gave in and paid for my hour with her. Halfway in her stripper friend literally just walks by the backroom we were in and sat right on the arm of the couch I was literally having sex on at the moment and starts rubbing my girls chest and taking out hers. At this point the girls already told me it was an anything goes type of place if you pay the right price and honestly I had enough cash for the both of them. I ended up having my first threesome and dear lord was it amazing. I know I paid for this but for my first time to a strip club of any sort? Not bad kid. But this is kinda where the FU begins.

See, after I had my fun time I wanted my friend who had been waiting for me to have some fun but he was busy falling in love for one of the stri.. hookers honestly and isnt realizing that she just wants his cash. Hes telling me how she genuinely likes him because they talked while he was shitface drunk and he was only gonna go for her. I could tell he was drunk because of all the beautiful girls he could've chosen he chose the horsiest faced lady I've ever seen. He didnt realize his card had a max atm amount and asked if I could front him several hundred. I ended just giving it to him as a belated birthday gift. After all our entire trip and stay was a gift from his parents. We finish our fun and stick around for a few more drinks and dances. My friend little to my knowledge had been downing about 6 double shots while I was in my room and by the time we left he was damn near hugging everyone and telling them his life story until I dragged him away from them and apologized. Our saving grace was our awesome uber driver who let my friend drunkenly rant about how our driver had the same name as spongebobs fucking snail and then pulled over to let him puke two feet away from a garbage can on the sidewalk. We get to our hotel and as I'm climbing up the steps I open the door and notice my friend isn't behind me. I turn around and hes on the floor on his back laughing with his eyes closed, turns around and starts kissing the floor and a light post next to him. I picked him up with the classic arm around my shoulder and listen to his drunk small talk as I carry him up the stairs and get him in where he tornado puked our bathroom up for a while. 

You'd think that would be the end of the fu. We went to a club, spent thousands more than planned and drank to oblivion within hours of landing. I'd barely escaped out of there learning a lesson but my friend had honestly thought he was in love with that stripper and got her number. I've tried to explain time and time again that she just wants his money but today he ended calling her again after I told 50 times that that was a one time thing and the whole it's her job to pretend to like you explanation. But alas, he ended spending like half of his savings on this girl that I dont think he can afford in the first place. I think he learned his lesson after tonight though but we still have two more days and he told her he'd try to see her again. I think I gave my friend a great time but at the cost of him being to stupid or ignorant to know when it's over. Not sure what to do now but I'm kinda pissed and am writing this as I wait for him with a different girl that came with her friend to finish in our hotel room. My fingers hurt from typing so fast. But I feel like I vented my frustration with this dummy well enough for tonight and I'm chillingwith a model on the beach smoking a blunt so cant conplain. But I do feel kinda guilty/betrayed that he called her again for a pricy bootycall.

And while she is really nice, and can be very cute at times, there are times, when we both fight, and when we do, it's really big ones.

Similar thing happened when we were talking yesterday. A little bit of back-story, she is an International Student in Canada, and I recently become a Canadian Citizen. We both go to the same university, and were, in the same Program in the first year, and that's how we met, we have the same common group, and it slowly and progressively developed from a best friends(5/6 months prior to dating) to a relationship. We also took the sexual aspect very slow, because she is not too comfortable with sexual things... So while we had our first kiss, on the first date, But We haven't had sex (as she only wants to have it after we marry since she doesn't want her mom to find out she's doing something ""bad""), and I've barely touched her parts some times ALTHOUGH every-time, I do finger her, she would stop me after some time, and just start hugging and going inside me. I asked her why, and she would never tell me. Also I have what I consider and the way she portrays me a very high sex drive over-all, (Note: before we started dating, I use to have sex about 1-2 times a week with obviously other women) Whereas, she has never had it before, and I am also her first boyfriend.

Now to the story, So given the Covid Pandemic and the recent surge in cases in my province of Ontario, my GF decided to go back to her country to live with her parents. And she has been there for about a month by now. So given my horniness, I was obviously asking if she was comfortable with  Sexting. And before we even get to hot stuff, she'd just change the subject and just make a normal conversation, and I got mad, at her always avoiding the talks of anything even close to Sex. So I confronted her, that if this is how it is gonna be after we marry, then I can't marry. I have my sexual needs, and if she is gonna be like this, I don't see any hopes in this relationship. And so she's like No we will have sex as much as you want, and I get more mad at her, that, I Don't want her to have sex, forcefully just coz i am horny, I want her to enjoy it too. Coz if she is just having it for the sake of it, then I wouldn't like it, as I only enjoy sex when my partner does too. And so we had a huge fight, which ended in her going to sleep (since it got late at her place).

Hence came today, so we both got time to talk, and we were talking about other things, since she said she doesn't want to discuss anything about sex until she comes back. So we were casually talking, and I was telling her how it's been cloudy here most of the days in Winter ( I get depressed with Gloomy Weather, it just makes me depressed) Which is why I have been saying that I want to leave Canada for Good, and Move to a More sunnier place like California or Arizona (in the USA). She is like ""NO, I don't like that place at all and nothing I do can convince her to move there."", and I obviously tell her that I can't live in this Place. And Probably because of her being mad from the conversation from yesterday, She Says, that I won't move to anywhere but Canada (Note: She has her best-friend who came to the same city as us from her home-town). And After a lot of back and forth, I am like Fine, let's just live in Canada, but then I want to live in a place where there is a lot of Sun, Like Calgary or so. She's like no, I am not moving anywhere, I am gonna stay here and just stay here and do what I want. If you want to move, then either adjust or move on(meaning break-up). Now I know she's probably mad and that's why she's said that. But It just trips inside me if we are really compatible? Coz for a realistic person like, having all love and no compatibility is still a recipe for disaster. And which makes me wonder the question if we are really compatible.

Some more things we are different on: Political views (while I won't get to specifics but just putting it out there). Choice of shows. Workaholic: She loves working all the time, While I like my free time every-now-and-then to play a game or so. Food:  She likes sweet and doesn't like spice, I love spice and hate sweet. The way we handle stress : She likes to cry it out, and needs pampering, while, I like to sit and brainstorm the actual solutions to solve the problem. etc...

So Reddit, What is your stake on it? Am I over-thinking it because of LD, repeated fights, and anger? Or Are we genuinely not compatible?

TLDR; Me(22M) and my GF(22F) are almost polar opposite, and while there is love, there is also quite a lot of fights.

She has a diary, and I don’t usually read it, but she was up late last night writing in it and I made the mistake of reading it (I know, it was wrong, shame me, I won’t do it again.) 

She wrote in it that she always has to initiate sex and she hates that, and it makes her feel unwanted and unattractive because I never initiate with her and turn her down a lot. She wrote that even if I try to initiate, not to have sex for at least a month. She went so far as to make a whole plan of things she’d do to distract herself. 

She’s brought up the initiating sex thing before, but we have drastically different sex drives and I don’t want to initiate when I’m not in the mood. She could go 10 times a day while I’d prefer once or twice a week. 

She did write in her diary that she loves me and that I’m the best boyfriend she’s ever had and she doesn’t want to lose me over sex, but she’s tired of feeling frustrated. 

Earlier I actually tried to initiate after reading it and she rolled over and went to sleep (she usually stays up until 2-3 am while I go to bed around 9-10pm, so it was unusual she went to sleep so early.) 

I don’t know what to do because I don’t want to go a whole month without it, but she wrote that when she’s stopped initiating in the past, and waited a week, I was much more turned on and basically ripped her clothes off at the chance. 

It made me sad because she wrote in her journal that she felt so ugly and unwanted, but she’s the most gorgeous girl I know.

Apologies for formatting issues but using a mobile.

TLDR: husband is having an emotional affair with his colleague and they now want to pursue an extramarital sexual relationship with each other. 

Apologies for the very, very long story, but it's a complicated one.

Backstory: my husband and I have been married for nearly 10 years, together for 12. We have a six year old child. We've had our ups and downs but no issues with infidelity until recently.

Our marriage hit a very rocky patch about a year ago. I was unhappy about many aspects of our relationship; predominantly; his lack of emotion, our lack of intimacy and his demeanor towards me (patriarchal and often condescending) and this was strongly affecting my desire to have sex with him. I told him this upfront and he was obviously very hurt. 
I was also struggling to deal with being bisexual and in a straight marriage. He has known about my bisexuality from day 1. 
These issues were huge for both us. It was incredibly painful telling him and obviously very difficult for him to hear.
To complicate matters, I have a gynaecological condition which can make sexual intercourse painful. This condition, combined with the above, meant that sex was a rare occurrence. 

The rocky patch and intimacy issues became so bad that we were considering separation. I suggested that we might want to consider exploring polyamory as an alternative to separation. He said that he was open to me exploring it (in order to fulfil my attraction towards women), but that it wasn't for him.

In the last six months we have both worked to resolve the non-sexual issues in our relationship. 
I tried to talk to him about the fact that we were barely having sex and that I was aware and concerned about the fact his needs weren't being met. I offered other forms of sex (sporadically) but was usually (politely) turned down, with him citing my gynaecological condition as a get-out. 

Apart from our sex life, our marriage was otherwise happy. For the last six months he has been affectionate, loving and complimentary, frequently indicating that he is still attracted to me, but never actually instigating sex. 
The relationship issues I had been experiencing dramatically improved as his demeanor and attitude changed. However, I missed having sex and intimacy with him and frequently told him so. 


Fast forward to 3 days ago. Things are good, we've had a nice evening. Our child is staying at her grandparent's house overnight. Completely out of the blue, Husband says he wants to talk about relationship stuff. 

He asks how I'm feeling- I tell him that I'm so much happier and that I'm so relieved that we've worked through a lot of our issues. I tell him that I love him and that being a happy family unit is the most important thing to me.
I acknowledge that our sex life isnt great but that I hope my symptoms will ease and / or we can work together towards improving it.

He agrees that our relationship is generally good but that our sex life hasn't improved at all.
He then says that ""I had talked before about polyamory , how do you feel about it now?""
I ask him, why? Do you have someone in mind? He says yes. 
Please bear in mind that this conversation comes completely out of the blue and that we had not discussed polyamory apart from me mentioning it more than six months ago.

Initially he refuses to tell me any details but he eventually says that it's a woman in his team at work (he is her boss). He told me as little as possible but here is what I know;
- they developed a ""growing attraction"" to each other over the last few months.
- They've both been working from home for the last 8 months. He assures me that they have not met up and that this attraction has arisen only via zoom calls and phone calls.
- they discussed this mutual attraction about a month ago and decided then that they both want an extramarital (and sexual) relationship together 
- they agreed that they would then broach it with their respective spouses
- he says that wanted to be sure that this is what THEY wanted, before telling me anything. They had agreed that he would tell me on this night, because our child wouldn't be at home.
- he denies them having contact outside of work, be it texting / phoning/ meeting up, but there's many calls in his log to/from her on days that they weren't at work together (Christmas eve, new year's day etc)
- most of the calls are when I'm at work
- he says he doesn't love her but he wants to be in a relationship with her
- he says he loves me and that this isn't to replace me
- he refused to let me read their messages to each other and deleted all of their conversations 
- he said that she respects him and is interested in him, whereas I dont and am not interested in him. Furthermore that he doesn't expect me to be interested in him after 12 years together?!

I told him that I don't want a polyamorous relationship and asked why he didnt talk to me about it first? He said he was being rational in approaching it this way.

I had a very strong emotional reaction to the whole situation, for which he berated me for. He said that my reaction sums up the problems in our relationship and my ""fucked up issues"".
He goes on to say that he hasn't wanted to have sex with me ever since I told him about how I was feeling (a year ago). I asked why he hadn't been truthful about it whenever I brought it up, and he said that he was being polite.
 
He has agreed ""not to actively pursue a relationship"" with her ""for now"". However he said that he still wants to be in one with her and that he will ""get back to me"" when he's decided what to do.
He will still be in daily contact with her because of work but said that he will ""keep it professional"".

He told me that he immediately texted her after he told me. He then phoned her the next day and told her that they would ""revisit the situation "" at a later date.

I have been to hell and back the last few days. The hurt and betrayal is agonising.   

To make matters worse,  he said that this entire situation is my own doing and that it was entirely natural for him to have gone down this path.
He said that he was willing to try and make things work between us but as he ""has zero interest in having sex with me"" he doesn't see how the situation will improve and that he will probably still want a relationship with her.

He has point blank denied ANY wrongdoing. He has also emotionally manipulated me into agreeing that ""yes it's my fault"" we are in this situation.

He has refused to disclose any further information about her/them. He said that my desire to know the details is symptomatic of how I dont actually understand what our relationship issues are. Moreover, that it's a part of my ""fucked up"" mentality to need to know the details.

 Since this initial revelation he has initiated sex with me (twice).  I was so relieved that he wanted me, that I was happy for it to happen. When I asked him about it, he said that it has left him with more questions than answers.

He continues to say that he loves me and that he wants us to be a family.

I have gone from being utterly heartbroken to feeling angry. I feel like he has emotionally manipulated and gas lit me every step of the way.
I feel that he has used something (which I said in desperation) as a way of legitimizing wanting an extramarital affair. He continues to deny that he has done anything wrong or that anything inappropriate took place between them.

What the hell do I do now? 
I dont want to sit around waiting for him to decide if he's willing to just be with me and not her.
I want to confront him about lying about their phone calls outside of work, but he said that if I ask him anything else about them, it will further justify my wrongdoings and his legitimacy for pursuing her.

I'm not even sure if I can love him after this....

If you managed to get to the end - thank you. Any advice would be so very much appreciated.
At the end of the day, I just want my child to be in a loving and stable environment.

I wont be revealing my age, but I am fairly young. This all happened today. Also, throwaway,

So, it all started one hour ago. I won’t even lie, lately my lady bits have been a bit irritated and I realized I may have a yeast infection. How fun! So, I was in need some of that good ol’ ✨vaginal cream.✨ I was a bit too nervous to go to the store myself and buy some (for whatever reason), so I messaged a few of my lady family members in hopes they may have some to spare. One of them being my aunt. Luckily, I get a reply that she is at the store and that shes willing to get me some. Bingo.

**Now, this is where the FU happens.**

She asks if I would like anything to eat or drink, and I reply with “those tall ICE seltzer waters”, then proceed to go on google and download a picture of one, just to make sure she gets the right one.

Now, rewind time a few days back, where I had downloaded this among us fanart... though, it wasn’t any ordinary fanart. Both red and orange were HUNK-IFIED, And reds bright, well toned butt cheeks were just staring at you. Yeah, certainly an interesting piece of work... And no, I did not download that image for any other reason then to be edgy and send it to my friend circles group chat.... 😳

Now, I proceed to return back to messenger to send over the photo of the drink. I open photos, tap it, and send.

wait.

no.

My mind quickly turns to mush as I realized I had accidentally sent the sexy among us artwork by the drinks side.

my heart starts to race. I quickly hold down the photos to delete it, but it’s too late. She had already started typing. I existed the app in sheer embarrassment, then got the following message from her: “👍”. I sat there, in panic. I quickly scurry to tell my friends what’s happened, and now I’m waiting for my aunt to come to my place and drop off my products.

I can never play among us again -

I’ve been married to my husband (also 26) for just over two years. We started talking when I met him at work after I graduated college. I found a better job shortly afterward but we stayed in contact and started dating.  
   
When I was in college, I made and uploaded content to a very popular porn site for a few months. In that time I posted very regularly. I made both solo content and some content with my boyfriend at the time. These videos are still up. They were part of a phase of self-discovery I went through. I do not regret these videos, I never showed my face and (as far as I know) nobody I know in real life (except my ex and a few of his friends that were involved) ever saw or knew about these videos, so the videos are still up. I’m not proud of them, but I’m not ashamed of them either. They’re part of what made me who I am today, and they’re a true part of my past. I’m not going to erase them.  
   
When my husband and I got married, I made it very clear that these videos existed. At the time, my husband seemed uncomfortable with it but assured me that he was okay with it, and just requested that I never tell him anything about or show him these videos. I’m not in the habit of watching my own content so this was a perfectly reasonable arrangement for me.  
   
When the pandemic started, both of our jobs moved online, and suddenly we were spending a lot more time at home. Our sex life has always been good, but recently it went through the roof. We started experimenting a lot more  One of the things we started doing was watching porn together.  
   
We were in the middle of our… times yesterday and we got recommended one of my old videos. My husband recognized me and pointed it out immediately, but I closed the tab before he could ask me anything. I asked him if anything was wrong and he assured me he was okay, but we didn’t end up having sex.  
   
Well, this morning I woke up to an empty bed and found him sitting in the living room. Apparently, he’d been up for a while and had been watching my content. What followed was the worst argument of our relationship. I don’t want to go into the grisly details, but we both yelled. Basically, he demanded I take down the channel. I reminded him he had already said he was okay with me keeping those up, but he said me he had no idea I had videos with other men, and that this is way beyond the line. I told him that was only because he said he didn’t want to know anything about them. We went back and forth for a while but didn’t come to any conclusions.  
   
Now he won’t speak to me until I do it, but I don’t want to delete the videos. I feel like it’s unfair of him to hold this over me like this after he expressly said he was okay with it. So Reddit, I come to thee to mediate our dispute. AITA?  
   
TL;DR: I have adult content online from a previous relationship. Husband previously said he was okay with it, but now wants me to take it down.

We have been best friends for five years and have always supported each other (especially emotionally). She is and has been the closest person to me for almost as long as we've known each other. I cannot express how much I love her, and I know she feels the same. However, for a while now we've been really struggling when it comes to the sexual part of our relationship. 

We are both insecure, but she helps me overcome how I feel about myself and I am very comfortable with her at this point. She, on the other hand, has been struggling with being physically vulnerable around me recently. She has assured me it has nothing to do with trust and that she is still attracted to me, she just can't get over the hate she holds for herself. Because of this, we haven't had sex in over three months. I refuse to ever push her to do anything when she feels uncomfortable with it and at this point, I've stopped even trying to initiate anything. We still spend time together and snuggle in bed, etc., but I'm struggling not having any remotely sexual aspect to our relationship. She has never been a super sexual person, but she was always happy to do things as long as they were relatively vanilla. For reference, she was never comfortable kissing in front of anyone--even hello or goodbye, but at night time when we were alone, she was usually okay with fooling around. It wasn't until our one year anniversary that we actually had sex. We did it on occasion since then, but somewhat infrequently. We still did other stuff most nights we spent together, until a little under a year ago when it became noticeably less frequent. Being a stereotypical 18-year-old guy when it comes to that sort of thing, I was always ecstatic to do anything, so it was always her wants that would decide if we did or did not. 

COVID hasn't helped our situation; we don't see each other nearly as often as we did last year and have grown apart just a little bit--though we are still very clsoe. However, I don't see COVID as the root of the problem and I feel like there is something other than just her self-hatred standing in the way of us. Even with the separation, I still text her and ask to watch movies online together (etc.) on a regular basis, but she usually lacks the motivation to say yes. She has been having trouble with motivation on all fronts for a while now, the pandemic function as a pretty big depressor. 

I worry and sometimes ask her if she just isn't sexually attracted to me anymore, but she always tells me she is and ends up feeling badly. She thinks that because I ask her questions like that, she is making me hate myself. She feels guilty every day for ""hurting me"". I explain to her how much I love her and, though it's hard, I'm here for her and want to help her with her self-esteem problems. At this point, she is so sure she is making my life entirely miserable that she has brought up breaking up on several occasions. We are very honest with each other, but my insecurities sometimes make me doubt her attraction to me. 

Neither of us want to break up, and we have already said that we would stay friends no matter what. But she is depressed and I don't think I am helping no matter how hard I try. I have asked her on many occasions if there is anything I am doing to contribute to the problem or if there is anything I can do to help, but it always makes her feel worse and her answer is always no. 

I love her and I love spending time with her. She always makes me smile and makes me happy. I am sure that I still make her happy as well. I just don't know what to do anymore, the whole situation just feels wrong.

Some background to start: Last year in March my exboyfriend broke up with me, and my friend (I'll call him James here) who had also recently gone through a breakup and I became a lot closer as friends because we were in a similar place. In April we became friends with benefits (FWB) with an understanding that it was just sex and if either of us caught feelings we would tell the other because we are friends and don't want to damage our friendship. James was hurt badly at the end of his last relationship, without going into it too much his ex cheated on him and basically destroyed his trust with how she went about it. My relationship with my ex ended a lot less dramatically and I think we could even be friends in the future. I should also mention that I don't want a relationship right now just because of where I am in my life and I'd like to just grow more as a person and get other things in my life sorted before I get into another relationship. My feelings for James are more of a crush than a desire to have a relationship.

Onto the actual issue: I recently realised that I had caught feelings for James, we talk everyday, he's not the only person I'm sleeping with and not  the only FWB I've had in my life, so I know this isn't the extra bond I normally experience when I have a FWB. On Christmas Eve I told him that I had caught feelings for him, and that I understood he probably didn't feel the same way and that while it was awkward and difficult to tell him I wanted to be honest. I also told him I understood if this meant he didn't want to have sex anymore because it could get messy. He was glad for me that I was over my ex enough to get to a point where I could have feelings for someone else, and said that he wasn't there yet.

You may think I'm dumb for this, but we agreed to keep having sex on the basis that my feelings were just a crush and I don't want a relationship so its not like he's stringing me along in any way (also the sex is really good haha). A week or so after that we were having a jokey conversation where he was teasing me about something and I (jokingly) said he was being mean to me and he made a joke about how guys tease girls they like and I said that reasoning didn't make sense because he doesn't have a crush on me. He then told me that he wasn't sure how he feels and he's very confused about all of his feelings at the moment. Which on a logical level I understand, I took a while to sort out my feelings and figure out what I was actually feeling before I told him I had feelings, but he's not had that time.

Since then we haven't really discussed it and I've left him to think on his feelings, but we still talk everyday and we've seen each other and had sex several times since that conversation. Obviously I want to give him space to figure things out, but it is eating me up inside to not know how he feels or if he even has feelings for me. On the one hand, even if he did have feelings too, I wouldn't want a relationship so it almost doesn't matter but on the other hand, I do really want to know how he actually does feel as I think it would make it easier for me to sort out my feelings. I'm unsure if I should press the issue or let him figure it out before I push him for a definitive answer. We have been friends for 5+ years and there was nothing sexual between us until last year, and I really don't want to lose this friendship over some feelings that may or may not lead to anything.

So, people of reddit, as I clearly am incapable of making good life choices, what should I do next?

My son who is almost 2 has slowly started to learn how to talk most of the time he just repeats stuff me or the wife say. I happen to have a very colorful vocabulary and am learning not to swear around the baby. Anyway my parents were over that morning and gave him a few presants. One of these presants happened to be a toy phone.

When he got it I pretended to have a conversation with someone on it a passed it back to him. His little mind was blown and thought I was actually talking to someone. He grabbed the phone out of my hand and pressed it right up to his ear to hear what they were saying. As he heard nothing he passed it back to me and the process repeated itself. This happened all day non stop and my conversations were getting shorter as I was trying to help my wife prepare for the following day.

Later into the day before we settled him for bed he would not stop handing me the phone.

Now fuck off!"" and I proceeded to pass the phone to my son who gladly took it and repeated the words ""fuck off""

Then an unknown man arrived and I know is that I was extremely confused and dissociated, but I remember him kissing and cuddling me and me giving him a blowjob ( I absolutely did not want it, I was physically forced) . I don’t know how or why then and not before but I fin ally ran away . I felt very dissociated and insecure happily I could call a friend of mine whom helped me a bit through talking and reassuring me .

Me (32m) abs my wife (30f) are very much in love, we soon will celebrate our 5th anniversary and have two kids.

There's only one tiny thing getting in the way, she used to be much more sexual, if I'm honest it was always something that was very important to me in relationships and my nightmare scenario was always to be in a sexless marriage.

I think I need to explain this, I have very high sexual apatite and always did, but as the years gone by my wife's apatite grown less and less.

We do have sex, sometimes 4 times a week but it's not nearly enough for me. I try to ask her, maybe selfishly, to have sex or satisfy me in other ways but she won't do it because she's not in the mood and doesn't like giving blowjobs (which she used to do).

It may seem like a small matter to many people but it's a big deal for me, and we did have long talks about it but only to reach a point when she said I pressure her into it
And I don't want to do that but I'm walking around frustrated most of the time, sometimes I think I should just end this, but it's silly because I love her. And I would never cheat.

Will it ever get better? If not I better end it.
But I love her, and there are kids.

A year in I found out that he's addicted to porn. He would literally sneak away during housework to wank in my home and stuff. I was incredibly disgusted. I didn't throw him out though, partly because before I found out I genuinely thought I could spend my life with him and more importantly because of financial reasons it didn't make sense for either us to pay full rent.

Now, the way it worked out is that I've been paying basically everything as he doesn't have income for nearly the last year. It's not his fault he lost his job, but it sucks. He swore up and down the block last time he'd never look at porn ever again. I was just starting to believe him. The last month or so things have been going good. I was looking forward to spending time with him and stuff.

And then today, I just... Have this feeling. Hard to explain but like I knew something awful would happen and then suddenly I could think of nothing other than THAT. I asked thoughout the last year if he ever broke his promise nd he always denied it. Today I basically lied about a feature my Internet service provider offers that let's me check history and such, and asked if I'd find pornhub there. He admitted it almost immediately and said that he'd wanked to porn upwards of 20 times.

Naturally I'm horrified, disgusted, angry everything you can imagine. I mean I bitch slapped him. First time in my life I even remotely had that urge and yknow what it may sound toxic but god it helped me in that moment.

Anyway, his own mother and my best friend agree that I should probably throw him out but part of me wants to see if given proper tools he can get better (and mid covid is literally the worst time to make him homeless in a foreign country where he doesn't speak the language).

He agreed without batting an eyelash to switching to a flip phone that doesn't do Internet, got a shitty chrome book that frankly doesn't have the ram to watch videos but will run word which is all he technically needs, and agreed to completely give up all devices with a screen basically.

Now these WERE all my suggestions - as was therapy. He immediately booked a session for tomorrow with a male therapist (gender was my request as I have awful experiences with women and frankly therapy would likely involve both him and me anyway in this situation) that specialises in addiction, sexuality and relationships

Oh and NSFW but he even agreed to a chastity cage, which honestly I only suggested as a sort of idk joke? Basically to see how much he meant what I assumed to be nonsense. He just... flat out agreed. With some whining but like, that's fair imo. It's not something he has ANY interest in, sexually, that much I'm sure of. 

This is MUCH more than he did last time where he basically only promised not to do it again... And if makes it really hard to go 'oh he'll never change'... But I also have 0 trust left at this point. I am genuinely completely torn apart over what to do. 

I don't know what to do, and I was hoping that reddit may have more insights than the two people I asked - my best friend who insisted I dump him after the first time, and his devout mother who thinks he'll somehow get better if he comes home and stays with her (like no honey that's where this behaviour STARTED lol).

I was in one of my group chats, and someone shared that gif of the bear getting hit in the nuts with the cable. I flinched (as one does) and realized things didn't feel quite right in my genital area. So I reached down to investigate and found I had no sensation in the head of my penis.

Have you ever sat or laid down in a weird position, and pinched a nerve in your arm/leg that caused it to go numb? Turns out, I had done that. But with my dick.

Except, I didn't know that at the time. So my brain quickly started running through all manner of possibilities for why I couldn't feel anything in what is normally the most sensitive part I've got. Naturally, my mind went straight to the most terrifying options. I jumped off the couch, certain I was about to have to go to the ER, and felt a bit of pressure relief from my taint. I had somehow been sitting straight on one of the supporting beams in my couch (always sit on the cushion, not between them) and managed to pinch off a nerve.

So, crisis averted, right? Pretty minor fuckup, RIGHT?

Have you ever put your arm or leg to sleep, and then once you stop pinching the nerve, the sensation comes back? You know how WEIRD that feels, with the pins and the needles and the slight discomfort? I was now feeling THAT. In my dick.

Took the wind out of me for a few minutes. I was limping around for a bit while my wife laughed her ass off at me and the situation. I'll never sit on the crack between couch cushions again.

I just found out that he's been cheating on me since August at least, maybe even further back, I feel so broken and fucked up. How do I even talk to him about this??


My (21m) fiance (23m) and I have been having issues lately. Background: I met him in highschool and we dated for 3 years, we broke up for a while and eventually we decided to give things another shot almost a year ago. 
He's the love of my life, we both have our issues and we're both continuously working on them, we've both grown together as people, we've matured significantly, and I feel like we can make this work since we aren't kids anymore.

I am so in love with him, I'd do absolutely anything for him and despite us breaking up and dating other people for a while, I've never met anyone like him, never met anyone I loved as much as him, or anyone that I could love as much as him. We always have so much fun and hes always there to take care of me when I need him, he's the only person that really understands me tbh with all the trauma and everything I've been through. We've gone through the absolute worst shit through the past 7 years and we somehow made it through and I think that we're stronger than ever.

Recently I've been feeling like I can't do anything right, I've been extremely depressed and very quiet, other than my depression my fiance keeps accusing/asking me if I'm cheating on him and it's tearing me apart emotionally bc I feel like I put all of myself into our relationship, and there's no reason he shouldn't trust me he has all of my passwords, he has my location at all times, his fingerprint is on my phone and he knows my password, He keeps saying things that make me think that he thinks that I'm using him for literally everything imaginable, money, sex, attention, etc. I just don't understand how he could feel like this, I literally spend all of my paychecks on him, if I have money it goes to dinners for us, cigarettes for us, whatever we need. And every time I try to talk to him about something that bothers me it seems as if I always end up apologizing for it. 
Also I feel like our sex life is just making him even more insecure, we have have a very high sex drive but it takes me forever to come sometimes (if I even can,) but it's not like that for him. When he finishes and I don't(but I'm already satisfied) and I don't wanna keep going I feel like he feels emasculated (??) And I've told him that I love our sex and that he does satisfy me but he just keeps bringing up my ex (the only other person I've slept with) and comparing himself to them when there really is no comparison.  

I feel like my depressive episodes are taking a toll on him emotionally. But I just can't get better when I keep getting knocked down, it feels like I do something eveyday to bother him just by existing. I just want to be better for us, I want to continue growing but I feel like I've hit a wall. I feel like I keep having to defend the validity of my love and affection for him and I'm not sure if he'll ever feel comfortable with me bc it just isn't showing

TLDR: I think my boyfriends insecurities may be affecting our relationship and both of our mental health, I'm just wondering what I could do to help my fiance feel more comfortable in our relationship and help him feel more secure

My bf often tells me that he wants a family with me and propose to me. Everything would be fine.
But then there is his porn addiction, I would say. He didnt has a diagnose. But 1 ago we had many fights about it. At the first time I found out he had second insta, snap accounts, bought pics/vids on patreon and so on. We discussed a lot and I told him that I am really dissapointed and have some trust issues.
I really loved that man so much that I went back with him. He promised me: 1.) Never waste any money to porn and 2.) No personal contact to any bi*ches
I am not okay but I accepted that he has an folder on his phone in which are sexual pics, second insta,.. accounts. 
First question: Do you think this is normal?
I am pretty insecure. He is my first bf. He often told me he is a man and needs his space and all this sexual contents and that it doesnt habe to do something with me. But tbh I feel very bad about it. To know that he has so many porn sources and accounts just to stalk Girls. But I know that he doesnt change and that when I prohibit these things he will break those boundaries. He also said that making boundaries means to be narrowd.

My 2. question:
I found out he broke one boundary. I saw 3 chats on his 2. instagram where he sexted with one girl. I wasnt sure if she was a bot. Because on insta there are many sex, flirt bots. But they texted and she asked him if he is horny and he wrote yes and that he wants to see her boobs. Then she sent some videos.
This last action of him really broke my heart.

Disclaimer: new to reddit, please excuse formatting and other newbie mistakes.

I (20F) and my bf(21M) had just spent the evening getting dinner and having a wonderful night together. Went for food, went shopping, played a game together, all that jazz.  Usually we like to get a little bit physical, but there were other people in the house so obviously that was off the table. Before he went home he mentioned us sending some risky things later that night when he got home. 

Now before I get to that, let me reiterate the statement that I am new to reddit and the world of amazing things in this app. Recently, I discovered that they have whole ACCOUNTS dedicated to NSFW stuff- fascinating!! I have never in my life watched porn, (something super intimidating about pornhub) so I was a little bit weirded out, yet I decided to explore and marvel at the fact that people post that kind of stuff on here. Anyway, my bf and I are very open with each other: I tell him everything. So earlier in the evening I casually mentioned me finding some interesting stuff on reddit, and he began to ask what kind, what I found, what subreddits, etc.... he got kind of excited because he knew that porn was very new to me and was intrigued at me exploring. That made me feel pretty good! Anyways that was pretty much the end of our convo about it. That is, until he got home.

We started to text and he asked me more about my reddit discoveries (getting on the sexy topics- yall know how it goes), and I perhaps foolishly? Told him what I had been looking at, and we talked about me finding something a little more my speed being new to porn- all the crazy stuff was a little much for me. I was then on the hunt for something a little more vanilla. So I started to look at just pictures, and then just dick pics. He seemed interested yet mentioned about being a little insecure, but we joked about some funny weird stuff that I found on there. He then started sending me pics of himself- which of course I loved, but I thought we were still on the reddit topic, so i continued my search to find my niche that I thought he wanted me to find. 

Well my stupid brain of mine was so distracted in trying to accomplish the goal of finding stuff, that I completely negated the fact that he wanted virtual sexy time with me. So a few of his pics later, he asked me why I was taking so long to respond, to which I said something to the effect of “on reddit looking at dicks that aren’t yours”...... not such a great look huh?

He then got very quiet and very upset- to which I completely understand. I immediately realized that I had fucked up... big time. All because I thought HE thought it was hot that I was watching porn. *facepalm*... because it TOTALLY makes sense to basically ignore your SO’s pics to look at other’s pics so that your SO will think that’s hot.... like what????? So here I was, with a now SUPER insecure boyfriend, a reddit search history no one could be proud of,  and my incredible ability to create this situation itself. I swear I really am so stupid sometimes. In the moment I really thought “oh yea he’s gonna love that I’m doing this” and MEANWHILE I’m ignoring HIS pictures?!!!!! Oh my god I could die right now. How could I be so ignorant? All because I was trying to do something I thought he would like. Clearly I need to re-evaluate my life choices when it comes to this stuff. I’ve stayed away from porn my whole life- and I’m starting to think that it was all for a reason.

Thanks for reading and please be nice in the comments:)

Oh and PS: my bf and I talked it all out and it is now a joke between us. I pull stupid and idiotic stuff between us a lot and this is one big old cannonball in his arsenal of my situational belly flops. I am so lucky to have him and that he was able to see my ignorance and realize that it was all just a misunderstanding and not something more. I think I took the whole ordeal harder than he did lol!


Edit: since I’m new to reddit I didn’t really understand what the TL:DR was for, or what to put for it. Let me rewrite it.

Anywho, a few months ago I 'casually' said to my bf that I think black men are better looking than most white men. (Other than that I'm gay af) however that's pretty much the extent of it. I don't go out of my way to watch big black dongs or whatever. we have a healthy relationship and are super open. Fast forward so this meant that he thought I was into black men. he really wanted me to say something about BBC's and liking them and it pretty much made him finish but I just kinda brushed it off. 

The other night he told me he had been watching some porn for awhile now with black men in it to get into it for me? I suppose and he ended up really liking their dicks. I just feel he thinks I'm more into them than I am and I'm just denying it because I'm embarrassed. Not even black men like doing anything specifically he just kinda likes looking at... Big dicks on black guys if that makes sense? Tbh kinda wholesome. I guess on the other hand I don't know if it's problematic or that he/we are over sexualizing black men. I felt like it was kinda problematic and cried a lil because I felt really awful. At the same time I feel bad for him because I want to support his kinks but I just don't know how since I can't really get turned on from feeling guilty / or if I should support it because it's problematic. (???)

He's never expressed any interest in black people before this, so this is pretty new. Also it's the first time he's ever expressed anything remotely gay to me so I'd love some advice on how I can support that! Ive learned a lot from reddit so I would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks y'all.

When I was 14 my best friends dear friend pulled me to his bed on a field trip and touched my body and breast without any permission for a whole night.
Of course nobody believed me when I tried to talk about it, when someone told him about it he created his own version that I was the one who jumped into his bed.
Long story short after a year of trying to avoid him my best friend started to creat a bond between us, inviting him over when I was around, making us hang out. He started calling me to talk shit about her.
Eventually when I was still scared of him my Stockholm syndrome made me do everything for him. He knew that and that was what he wanted whenever he needed something he called me, it started with simple thing like homework, helping with school and stuff, than he persuaded me to work on the weekends and during summer in his ""company"" it was hard physical work. Of course all the time there was a mental abuse he was doing this thing when he was asking me 'am I really that bad, what am I doing wrong, is what I am giving you not enough' all the time these stupid questions. He had two moods, one that I just said and another when he was so selfish and talking how awesome, handsome he was and I had to agree otherwise he would be mad.
That was just the beginning it got weirder because he found a girlfriend and I had to go with him for shopping to find  presents for her, to buy stuff for her that she would like, help him with her parents and even when they wanted to stay longer or make a sleepover I had to be there because her mom wouldn't let her do this otherwise. I was even camping with them for a 3 days also because of her parents, and I stared noticing it and asking am I something like a third wheel and they both always said no.
This all ended when I started dating my wonderful boyfriend. When this abusing guy  was calling me I sometimes didn't answer, there was nothing more irritating for him then that, so he was calling for like 10 times. When I finally answered he was shouting where am I what am I doing and stuff, my boyfriend started to notice that.  I told him about this field trip accident but said I can't told him who the guy was. 
He eventually found out on his own and was so upset with me, I was heartbroken because he told me that this it so fucked up and I have to stop having any contact with this guy, of course he was right but it was hard for me when he told me that this looks like typical Stockholm syndrome, I was sobbing. How I could have been so blind. The next day I called my therapist and discuss everything with him. He confirmed the Stockholm syndrom.

I was hoping my first Reddit post would be a bit more positive, but here we are. Background knowledge, I am m (23) and my girlfriend is 22. I just graduated college in December, and I'll be moving 10 hours away from my hometown for work once COVID allows me to return to work.

My girlfriend (we will call her Miley) and I have been dating for 5+ years. We met in high school and began dating my senior of high school. We made it through college together, and she is graduating in May. We have been planning to move together for a long time now. Recently, Miley has been up and down with her mental/emotional health. She told me this was due to the pressure of her last semester, finding a job, and moving away from home. I have been supportive because I know the stress life has caused on everyone recently. Yesterday, she texted me that she had something we needed to talk about.

After work, she told me that 5 years ago she was raped on three different occasions by the same guy (we will call him Dane). Miley and Dane worked together when Miley was 17 at a restaurant. Dane was 22 at this point in time. We were in our senior year of high school at this point. Miley told me last night that she went to a party with this guy years ago. She had told me that she was with friends on this occasion. Miley told me that Dane and her were drinking and he started coming on to her. She told me that she clearly was declining his advances, but she realized he wouldn't stop and she began to try and mentally block what was happening. Miley told me that Dane had a friend we will call Seth that was at this party as well. Miley then told me about a week and a half later after the first incident, she got drunk with Dane again. Dane didn't have a license so Miley gave him a ride home after this party and she told me that he raped her again. She told me that this happened one more time about a week later. She told me that it was unwanted by her the entire time. She also told me that at a different party during high school, Dane's friend Seth followed her into a bathroom and lifted her on to the counter and began to try and pressure her. Her friends luckily broke into the bathroom to stop these occurrences.

I had always expected that something happened with Miley and Dane, but I wasn't very pushy because it was just a feeling. I would never have imagined that these things were happening though. One night at the gym that Miley and I went to, I saw Dane. Dane didn't know me and I just mentioned that he worked with my girlfriend. Dane then said that she was all over him while at work. This was a few years ago. I was thrown off guard by this comment, and when I asked Miley she just said he was being dumb.

Fast forward to now, Miley confessed this all to me yesterday. I obviously don't blame her for what happened to her and it is truly breaking my heart. I'm truly struggling how to process this all. She wants to continue our relationship and continue to develop the future we had planned. I'm upset that she lied about where she was at these times, but this was 5 years ago. During our relationship, Miley broke up with me once for about 3 days which she told me now that it was because of what happened to her. There was about a 6 month period where Miley and I stopped being physical with no explanation why. She now tells me it was because of what happened. There are many moments in our relationship that now make sense, but in those moments they didn't. I always felt at fault. I told her I needed time to process. I tend to suppress things, but I need to take these feelings head on. I feel awful that this happened to her and I still love her very much. What I'm struggling with is that she didn't tell me until now. I understand that this type of thing is hard to talk about, but looking back at all of our struggles it would have helped so much to have known these things. I struggle knowing it happened three times and that she spent time with him after the first, but I know that sometimes our emotions and thoughts towards what happens in our life doesn't make sense. I'm struggling knowing that she lied to me about what she was doing on those nights. I always told her that the people that she hung out with at this time were untrustworthy. Those nights she was at these parties, I was alone at home. I was ok with her going because I wanted her to have fun, but the parties she was at always seemed dangerous to me. Our relationship for the most part has been fantastic since then.

I'm now trying to decide how to feel. She blocked him on social media, but continued to like posts of his until about 2018 (I know I shouldn't have dug this deep). She is truly struggling with these feelings and felt like she couldn't tell me. We both agreed to seek counseling now, but I just don't have many people to tell because it is obviously private information. Any advice would be great.

My eldest sister \[F26\] withdrew from college to pursue a career as a social media influencer. Our little sister \[F19\] is currently attending college. Overall I've had a very healthy relationship with my sisters, and we've always been the confidants for each other.

2 weeks ago my little sister told me that college wasn't for her and that she was considering taking a break to pursue a career as a social media influencer like our older sister had done. While she hadn't discussed it with our older sister yet (she doesn't live with us), she was certain older sister would take her under her wing. It was obvious that my little sister had a heavily romanticized notion about the life our older sister lives, because older sister hadn't shared all the details with her, whereas I had been told much more.

Because she was going to submit the paperwork to withdraw from college that night, I decided to tell my little sister the painful truth: the notion that our older sister is living the good life as an influencer is a façade.

My older sister is gorgeous. She's been prominently featured in the regional Hooters calendar for multiple consecutive years. Building on her popularity from Hooters, she's built up her followings on instagram and TikTok to a combined 400k followers. But in years of trying, she hasn't been able to successfully monetize her social media presence. Even her onlyfans lost all momentum after I had talked her out it for privacy and safety reasons.

Before the pandemic our older sister was regularly posting content from interesting places with interesting people, but at best she's been a passenger along for the ride on other people's success stories, at worst she's allowing herself to be exploited. Her luxurious ""Girl's Trip"" to the Bahamas was actually her and 6 other would-be influencers she barely knew sharing a room they could barely afford even when splitting costs. She blew a marketing manager from a major shoe brand so he'd invite her to a yacht party with pro athletes and celebs. She was a NFL practice squad member's date to a destination wedding in Costa Rica, who then sent audio clips of them having sex to his ex, who was in the wedding party, to make the ex jealous. Over the years she's had sex with at least a dozen ""industry insiders"" who promised to help her career, and gotten nowhere. There's no glamour there, and that's exactly what I told my little sister.

This revelation came as a shock to my little sister, who went back to college for her Spring semester this week. Mission accomplished.

However, my older sister is furious at me for breaking her confidence and denying her the opportunity to tell our little sister everything herself. She says regardless of my intentions that her story wasn't my story to tell. She said she hadn't shared details with our little sister sooner because she'd been too young before and she's never asked, whereas I had.

So I’m going to call them Handsy and Naive respectively. (I’m going to try to stick to saying that as much as possible because I want it to be easy to read.)

Basically Handsy has been at it when Naive is in the bunk above her. When Naive tells Handsy to stop, she’ll either stops for a bit and then continues, or just continues. Naive has said that Handsy has been doing it when we go in her room to visit, and will just continue when we leave. Naive is annoyed Handsy keeps waking her up, but as the name implies she really didn’t know what Handsy was doing. Naive was just annoyed that she kept moving the bunkbed. So she complained to our older sisters at a restaurant, and they were like shi-. And I was there when they got home and broke the news to Naive.

So there are few concerns here,,,

1. Handsy is being completely unsanitary. She doesn’t wash her hands before doing it and (I don’t believe) she does it after, or go pee when she’s done.
2. Handsy was probably doing it in the bathroom before getting more ballsy about it. We all assumed she’s just reading in there as she brings her device. But she takes a very long time, and it just doesn’t seem reasonable to just start touching yourself at such an alarming rate with your sister in the room. So we can’t just tell to do it in the bathroom (I think).
3. The whole reason this was written, it’s waking Naive up, and she feels extremely uncomfortable now that she know what she’s doing. 

Naive wants to tell our mom and have her deal with, but me and my older sisters know that she won’t do anything about it. She likes to ignore things and pretend they’re not happening mostly when they don’t effect her. My older sisters want Naive to address it because they don’t want her to know we all know. And Naive wants me to address it as I’m closer to Handsy in age.

My boyfriend of 2 years 11 months is a very kind and caring person. Our only problem is he mostly cums when he is fucking me from behind. It doesn't matter which position, it's an ass thing. He doesn't masturabte because he can't come from it, and lasts forever in bed- he's just not a fast orgasm-er. He can cum other ways, but it takes an uncomfortable amount of time, and he almost always gives up. We did not have sex for the first year of the relationship. 


Without giving too much detail, I was raped almost immediately before he and I met. My rapist raped me from behind. I have been to therapy, have no more nightmares, no unexpected panic attacks, am back to trusting people, I just panic when I engage in any position that physically feels like the rape. I have tried before, and it ruins my week.


I am not sure what to do about this. I'm still in therapy, but this doesn't seem like something that will be going away any time soon.

My husband and I just moved, so we weren't sure if there was rat poison or antifreeze possibly laying around.  I rush her to the expensive 24/7 emergency vet immediately.  After an hour of being on the phone with pet poison hotline, giving them a huge list of things she could have ingested, my vet calls back with uranalysis results.  It's THC, the main component in marijuana.  My husband and I are heavy smokers, but notice nothing missing.  There was no way she got into our stash. That's when it dawned on me.

Three days ago our plumbing broke (moved in 2 weeks ago.)  Luckily my husband's father is a contractor and was able to fix the issue.  However, we were left without a bathroom for a day.  We have a privacy fence and decided to just go poop and pee outside, because the nearest store is quite far.

You guys...

My gross ass dog ended up eating our poop, therefore ingesting enough THC to make her high as a kite.  Apparently this happens to dogs on hiking trails.  My fuck up is not predicting this.  My dog LOVES eating my cat and rabbit's poop, so I should have seen this coming.

I'm just so sick of feeling this.

I'll be 30(F) later this year. I've barely had sex. I've never been in a serious relationship. I have to take xanax/ativan just to get through a date, and if the guy even remotely suggests sex I immediately lose interest. I've been in therapy for social anxiety (and a smidge depression) since I was 14. Used to be that I had trouble going to school, learning to drive, getting my first minimum wage job, etc. I worked HARD to overcome those minor things. I never thought I'd be able to go to college away from home, but I did. I just had to start taking zoloft to make it through. At 25 I had a major falling out with some college friends and was so anxious and honestly suicidal. After that, I was put on the highest dose of zoloft (200 mg).

I didn't have my first kiss until I was 17, and my ""boyfriend"" (we dated for 1 month) was 2 years younger than me. That was the best I could do. People I'd known since kindergarten were getting fucked regularly and I hadn't seen a penis in real life. Around Halloween of my freshman year of college I was pursued by this guy who seemed so nice, and he knew one of my suitemates, and he played guitar. I didn't realize I was a rebound. His ex lived directly below me. He was mean. One day he fingered me in his room and didn't ask me. I didn't try to stop him because I was afraid he'd think something was wrong with me. I felt pressured to go along with it because I didn't know when I'd get another opportunity to experience anything sexual. It hurt and I silently wept. He either didn't notice or didn't care. One day he got mad at me because I had my shoes on his bed. I thought we were joking around and refused to move. So what does he do? He yanks me off the bed by my legs and I go flying into his dresser. I wasn't hurt and I don't think he meant to hurt me, but his roommate was there and said \[fake name\] ""Jake, nooo!"" as if to say ""dude, you're gonna hurt her, cut it out."" In the end he said I was a dumb bitch who needed to ""get a major"" because every college freshman knows exactly what their major will be on day one, right, /s?

The first time I tried to have sex was at age 24. I was dating a friend from college. We always had a thing for each other, but he was always going after other girls for the sex that I wouldn't give him. Well, we finally got to dating and I felt comfortable doing sexual things with him a lot sooner than I thought I would. Sex was so painful I cried. Now, I thought I had vaginismus, but I can insert tampons just fine and my OBGYN has never had an issue examining me. But this HURT. We tried again another time...after we'd split a 12 pack of beer. This time I was extremely triggered. It hurt, he was able to fully get inside me but I was sobbing and covering my face. He tried to comfort me and I hit his hand away. He asked if I wanted him to stop and I said yes so he did. We broke up a week later. He was freaked out by me and I didn't know what was wrong with me.

December 2019 I went on a date with a guy I met on OKCupid. He tried to get me to come back to his apartment with the promise of weed (weed doesn't make me anxious, and if I'm anxious already I won't smoke). I knew he would try to sleep with me so I declined. I broke it off and felt awful the entire next day. By the time I got to therapy I was having suicidal thoughts. I sobbed about how I'd never be able to date. I'd never have that partner that I long for so so deeply. I'd never have kids. I'd be the only one of my sisters to be single. All my friends would get married and have kids or they'd choose to do neither but they'd be happy about it because that's what they actually wanted.

Ever since I was a teenager with anxiety, I've had suicidal thoughts/ideation. I never thought I'd make it this far, and I still don't know if I'll make it through the next 10 years of my life.

Today I'm going to share a story that I haven't had a chance to really share with anyone given the circumstances.

In 2017 I was 19 going 20 working for a family owned dental office that specialized in kids. My coworkers were great in fact I still keep in touch with them to this day. This particular office had two locations and depending on my schedule I would be at either or. At both locations I was very close to the billing department they were very welcoming girls. One morning a conversation striked about sugar daddies. I think it was along the lines with me thinking it was super convenient and I was totally down with it if Id ever have the chance. So my billing friend we will call her “Mia” Mia had a popular app that a lot of college girls used to meet men, go on dates and in return for their time they were to get an allowance. Mia told me that she had a long term ongoing relationship with her then so called “sugar daddy” and after so many appointments they actually ended up growing a bond. She spoke about I am sending money to her out of the blue. She was on his payroll, and he even had some of her bills on his auto pay. 

Naturally I was intrigued, I was struggling single mother. I also took on the responsibility of taking care of my mother and my then 14-year-old brother after my parents divorce. In my culture it's very normal to see this. I felt a staggering amount of responsibility and I felt that this was a way out of my struggle. My 9-to-5 was not paying the bills. It didn't take long for me to download the app and try it for myself. After downloading, I had overwhelming requests and messages with folks wanting to meet. I knew that I had to be careful, calculating and strategic. I probably had 5-7 dates a month. Some new and some returning men that I was starting to feel comfortable with. I'm not going to go much into detail about the meet ups since all of my relationships we're very compartmentalized and very organic each one. 

Some months went by always very mindful and aware. I had gotten some experience and was less paranoid, always aware nevertheless. This story happened right before my 21st birthday. I had already gotten pretty comfortable with the lifestyle, still keeping a 9-to-5 job having a couple of men always for a back bone. I ended up meeting this man we're going to call him Paul because that's his real name. I met with Paul in his very luxurious urban style condo in Scottsdale Arizona. In his condo he had an elevator and there were optional elevators in the hallways. (more on that later) The underground parking situation at his condo always gave me anxiety, it was so confusing and big so I just resorted to parking across the street at the Fashion Square. (more on that later) Paul was very peculiar… I would never leave with anything less then $1500. It would leave me with a lot of questions. One day I was hanging out with him in his condo drinking wine and he offered me Coke, I politely declined his offer. I noticed that he would get super paranoid when he did Coke. Out of the blue I asked him what he did for a living and he looked at me straight in the eyes and asked if I was the FBI. He seemed to be really put off by my question. I kind of just ignored it and looked for comfort in his two cats, he told me not to touch them. So I just decided to leave. Maybe he had too much substance and he needed a nap. I kindly departed.

With all the money I was making I decided to treat myself to a little cosmetic procedure that I've always dreamed of. I got my lips filled with my favorite filler, JUVÉDERM® Ultra XC. I was satisfied but a couple days later I went in and got them filled with JUVÉDERM® VOLBELLA™ XC to achieve my dream pout. Given how close these two procedures were and how I didn't have much time to heal from the first time there was pretty intense bruising. To my surprise Paul wanted to see me again so I got ready and went over. 
This time I fell animosity right off the bat. It was almost scary but I thought maybe it was just all in my head since this cat is odd anyway. We literally sat at his bar for what felt like three hours of him talking about these crazy conspiracy theories and how he feels like people are watching him. It was pure agony for me. Then suddenly something switched. His tone... His aura got darker than ever. At that point I didn't know whether to just bolt for the door, I felt frozen but I knew that I had to be calculated and careful with whatever the come out was. He got in my face, rubbed my chin and pointed to the bruises on my lips. He said “i'm not stupid, what is that you dirty sl**!” I explain to him that I just got my lips done and that they were healing. He continued to yell and imply that I gave him herpes. 


Suddenly his friend came in she was probably like in her late 40s and she gave me this dirty look... The vibe was so off. This was one of the only times I felt like my life was in danger. They started speaking in coded language, it was so odd. I could tell that they were texting from across the room. They would just look at each other and be silent. I told them that I forgot something in my car. I was scared to use the elevator in the condo so I immediately just bolted for the hallway and took the elevator downstairs. Something told me to run so I ran as fast as I could towards the mall where my car was parked. I looked back and I saw both of them in his BMW following me very slowly and beside him was the weird lady with binoculars. Luckily the parking lot where I parked wasn't too far and I smashed out of there as fast as I could. 

This was a learning experience for me and I only have one sugar daddy that I have a great bond with now. Ladies learn from this. I've had great experiences but there are some bad apples out there. My anxiety increased vastly and I resorted to become an exotic dancer. As a result my opportunities advanced, I was getting booked to fly from city to city, I met a lot of rappers, the possibilities are endless. I don't fear for my life and I have the guards on my back making sure that I'm OK,escorting me in and out of the property. I don't know what would've happened to me if I would have stayed. I still continued to use his debit card on my Apple Pay but he gave me permission to use whenever I needed it.

My dad and I were participating in an online pubquiz while being in a call with our 2 other teammates. I  wasn't thinking I would really make a difference because I kinda lack common sense, but I do know some random facts about music and animated movies etc, so why not try and be helpful and bring them 1 or 2 answers. 

All was going fine until the last question arrived. They wanted us to listen to this drum intro and tell them which company it was from. Fine, I thought, I might even know this one. And I did... During the second time the video was shown I was already dead inside because I knew that is was the beat-thingy you always hear at pornhub. 

The thing is: I'm a girl, teenager, that still possesses a pure soul and is too naive for this world. Anyone that has ever met me knows there would be no reason for me to know this quite interesting fact. I solemnly swear it's my friends who have enriched my knowledge about stuff like this.

Meanwhile, my dad had sensed that I had died inside and probably expected me to tell the team what I thought was the answer, because it looked like no one else knew. And like the game fanatic I was, I just told them it was from pornhub and quickly added it was because of my friends that are always the ones giving me the cultural information I need to understand the gen z culture. Everyone looked like they believed me but were a little confused, because I would indeed be the last person on earth to know this. 

So this was the last question of our wonderful quiz (capturing ending right?) and that meant that we had to wait a bit longer until we got our answers, as they were calculating the final scores. I was terrified I got it wrong and everyone would think I had been hiding a very different side of myself for a long time. I was also terrified I got it right, for the same reason. Let's just say I was incredibly nervous and scared of both outcomes. 

Finally, the answers came. Yay, I got it right... Even though I actually had nothing to be awkward about, I couldn't help but think about the new perspective my dad and his colleagues had possibly thought they gained about me this evening. I really hope they believed my explanation. On the bright side, my point made the difference between the 11th and 14th place, so you could say it wasn't for nothing. 

TL;DR: During a pub quiz with my dad and his colleagues, there was a question involving the intro from pornhub. I am an extremely innocent teenager, but I was the one who told the team of grown-ups it was pornhub, and now they (especially my dad) probably think I'm not the person I seem to be.",0,0,tifu,t5_2to41,nsfw,TIFU by knowing the answer to a pub quiz question,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/l6ha1n/tifu_by_knowing_the_answer_to_a_pub_quiz_question/,promo_adult_nsfw,137.5

Well, it didn't happen today but like last year. I was still exploring my body as a teen, and after researching stuff about anal fingering, I figured ""this was the day!""

I was horny af but I waited until everyone was asleep and sneakily went down to the bathroom, grabbed some lube and rubber gloves, and did... *stuff*. Of course it felt weird and disgusting but I still continued.

But the thing is, there is a small screen opening just above our toilet area (it's pretty high), so if you're not in the shower area (aka me while doing the deed), someone can see inside if they really wanted to. We're in a rural area plus there are clear boundaries/walls everywhere so no one can really sneak inside to peek. Well, except our family, of course. I think I was making some questionable sounds too. 

My sister came home late that day and PROBABLY saw me because I heard some noise outside. Then the next day, she sent a message saying, ""Are you gay?""

MY HEART RACED SO FAST. Wtf, I didn't want to come out like this lmao.

She tried to bring it up a few times but I just ignored it and changed topics instantly. Luckily, she kept quiet about it and didn't speak that to me ever again. I didn't even find the experience pleasurable because my ass hurt like hell lol.

Hello, this is a throw away account, I've never been on reddit before so I'm sorry for all the mistakes I'm making but I'm desperate for advice and this is the one social platform my partner isn't on.

We have been together for 9 years, married for 4. Like everyone we've have been heavily quarantined in a major city with no relief, no family and no one but each other. As with many our mental health is been up and down for the past year.

The past few months my wife has been becoming more and more needy for affection, compliments and sex.  The main problem has been sex. Because my anxiety and depression have been so high it's been triggering my period to last for weeks and weeks. Meaning we can't have sex. (Sometimes I'll just pleasure her even tho I can't)  Even when I don't have it my depression/anxiety kills my sex drive.

We have never been a couple that has really had this problem before and have never fought a lot before but this issue comes up several times a month. If I refuse sex she cries saying it's because I don't find her attractive (completely untrue). To the point she asks if she should start wearing more make up or style her hair or wear different clothes etc. I keep telling her I think she is beautiful, I am sexually attracted to her as she is and that I'm just going through a lot emotionally and just have 0 sex drive.

It's gotten to the point where I'm now scared to even kiss her or cuddle her because when I do she she just starts trying to undress me, feel me up etc.  And not like a quick little pat, extremely aggressive. I have told her several times she needs to stop. I tell her I would cuddle her more etc if she would leave it be just that and not try to get more and that she is breaking trust but she says she is so pent up and she can't help herself. She literally cries alone because she is so pent up sexually and needs a release from all the stress etc. She is convinced it's because she is ugly. She says porn, masturbation is not enough.

It's gotten to the point we fight about this weekly. I have offered/suggested counseling and marriage counseling but she refuses to go. Unfortunately, she has had a very bad history with medical professionals in the past (doctors, dentists etc)  and doesn't trust anyone in any medical field.

I'm at the end of my rope and I don't know what to do. Is there medication to up my sex drive? Should I just give up and have sex whenever she wants and ignore my own feelings for the best of my marriage? Anyone else dealing with this? I just feel so alone and like I'm a bad wife.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Yes, I do exercise regularly, several times a week (Yoga, Cardio etc). Also I do take anxiety medication. I also use cannabis. I also struggle with insominia and in the past birth control has made that worse.

Also another problem is that a couple weeks ago she said that she finds it stressful to be in a relationship and has a hard time committing and feels like things are forced.

I know I don't post any pictures on reddit, before I didn't get offended but now I just get triggered because too many people just call me insulting names instead of my actual name, assume I am a guy and give me bad advice.

I apologize for the whiny question. I don't know if I am upset because my cat died yesterday and am on edge or it's because my period hasn't come yet and should come. I am aware that not everyone hates me and I don't get offended that easily, but certain topics like my personal life, certain family and body issues, my gender, bullying upset me more than normal and I dislike it because people use them against me. I feel like I can't win with people (males) who hate on me. Like leave a girl just post. 

Some of the advices I received were great. I have downloaded some apps and look through self improvement, meditation and social skills and they work like charm. But telling me to show my sags of milk or telling me to die or that I should keep to my self doesn't help me at all. I get upset when someone does this because I feel like I can't do anything and it returns me to my helpless position.

Is this just poor emotional regulation or is it something else? I know it is abnormal but I don't know what works for it. I have tried relaxing pills but they drug me and I can't concentrate on my lectures.

For me fandoms make me feel connected, to bond with people since I find it hard to have friends since my interests are not mainstream and I am a bit shy, which causes problems. I apologize in advance if my question is stupid but I asked a psychiatrist what should I do and he didn't help me at all, his pills only worsened my case so I stopped them and am trying to relax on my own.",0,0,NoStupidQuestions,t5_2w844,nsfw,Why would someone who is not a troll insult me without even knowing me?

We have been together for a few months now and are happy together, however in everything I do she finds it hard to give me any feedback or even say what she wants. I have no idea if what I am doing is correct or not, and this affects a lot of aspects of our relationship, not only sexual. However, with that I noticed it.

Usually communication is not bad at all between us, but when it goes to sexual stuff (no actual sex yet), petting or anything that's aming to please her, she can't tell me what she likes, wants or similar.

Any advice what I can do or ask that's simpler to answer than ""What do you like most"" or ""Do you want me to do ...?"" wich she can't answer or any tips for her? I fear that this communication difficulty can lead to a difficult relationship in the future :/

My bf 27m and I 25f have been together for almost 2 years. To me, the sex needs improvement and I want more of it. He hasnt found a way to get me to orgasm on a regular basis. I want to be able to find that but I can't seem to let go whenever hes down there or using toys on me. I think it's a mental thing but I want more sex to keep on trying. And I think he gets frustrated every time he cant get me there.

 To him sex is exhausting because he 'does a lot of work' and it 'takes too long.' We want to be able to have quickies but with his ED he has to take a pill to get it up and so the session usually lasts an hour.


He has low testosterone levels as well and currently they're trying to figure out why. This month he has some more blood work to be done and an MRI. Kinda scary stuff.

He does love me a lot. And I love him a lot. He says sex is so exhausting and he'd rather masturbate and get himself that quick release than sex. And that's understandable. But when I offer a BJ or handie he turns me down. Even tho I can get him there quite quickly. And that worries me and makes me insecure. Because I'm not sure if he has a porn addiction or isn't fully opening up to me or am I overthinking? It's a first serious relationship for both me and him so we're learning. A. Lot.

That brings me to my next point. We have an anxious-avoidant attachment style and we're trying our best to look our for signs for those traps where one of us doesnt feel loved and/or appreciated and we constantly do our best to communicate.

Sex to me is so important in a relationship and I need more but I'm not getting it. How do I make it better? What can I do? His T lvls are low so is that why hes just so not interested in sex? It's odd tho because he still wants to get off. But just not sex?

I've gotten increasingly scared of what I could be doing towards my SO. I won't go into detail, but I'm sure you'll understand me when I say that I messed up during intimacy with SO because of miscommunication. SO had previously said no because of time, when they still didnt want to say no. That is what I had thought they meant at this time too. I had been wrong, but I didn't notice that until it was too late. I had immediately broke down, I was disgusted with myself. Since then, I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. They forgave me about 2 months after, but I haven't been able to let it go, now 1 year later. The problem is, my SO has a habit of putting everyone else before themselves. That was part of the reason for the miscommunication. They have previously stated that they kept certain things hidden, since they only wanted other's best. They promised to never do this involving intimacy again, but I'm just too scared. 

This part will be a bit different, but I want some kind of help. They've said they like it when I take more control. However, they are majority of the time not interested in intimacy.

She knows that giving and receiving oral is a huge turnon to me, because I've told her many times, but she refuses to give it to me since she always complains that it makes her jaw hurt. At first she just said it caused a lot of pain, but she told me she had some weird jaw issue (she called it a bunch of letters idk) that makes her jaw her and pop out of its socket a lot if she does things like bjs. It sounds like a crock of shit to me, because I highly doubt that there is no condition centered around bjs, and I haven't seen her complain about anything other than bjs. She also won't show me ""proof"", other than an xray her DENTIST (not a jaw doctor) took that just looks like some normal jaw anyways.

Like I get that she's uncomfortable but at the same time its never ""comfortable"" to be suffocated by a pussy, you know? Yet I will eat her out while she sits on my face.  Something clicked on me that she's been getting all the benefits while I'm just supposed to deal with this with blue balls. Any time I ask for her to reciprocate, it causes an argument.

This morning the same thing happened. I asked her if she wanted me to eat her pussy before work and she said yes, so I got down under those hot stuffy blankets and ate her pussy. She came twice, and after I came up I told her it was her turn. She asked me what I meant and I told her that I was tired of being the only one giving any love in this relationship and that it was her turn.  She called me a selfish asshole and told me she never agreed to it and so I told her if she didn't suck my dick we were done, because I'm tired of worshipping her body all the time while she reuses to do the one thing that really turns me on just because she's lazy and a little uncomfortable.  She got angry, slapped me, and told me I'm a terrible person and that if I break up with her, she'll tell all of my friends about me ""sexually harassing"" her.

We dated for approximately 6 years before getting married. In the beginning, the sex was great. It was frequent and active. I'd dare even say it was extremely healthy and for me, that was a HUGE deal for a relationship. I am someone who believes that sex and intimacy are paramount to making a longterm relationship work. Without intimacy, you're essentially just roommates.

When my (at the time) girlfriend moved to the west coast for grad school (I was on the east coast finishing my undergrad) I knew the distance would be tough. We of course talked about it beforehand and agreed on seeing each other whenever we could afford it. When we were able to visit each other, the sex was great. We also attempted to have some virtual fun when visits weren't possible.Fast forward to her completing her graduate degree and moving back to the east coast to start her doctorate at an East Coast University. This was fantastic! I finally got my girlfriend/best friend back. However, sex changed. It slowly declined in both frequency and passion. I know, I also thought that maybe she had cheated while away at graduate school. She has always been very against the concept of cheating and I believed that she wouldn't have. It came up in discussions and she assured me that nothing happened. She simply didn't have the same sex drive as she once did. She claimed that she ""is growing up"" and that sometimes ""that happens with women"". Fair enough, but it didn't help my wandering brain.

Fast forward to our wedding year. We had moved to the city she grew up in (she landed a job after finishing her doctorate) and we were moving into our new home. We'd been married for a year and the sex was... pretty infrequent but it was still happening. But it continued to decline. So much so... that I currently find myself in a sexless marriage. We haven't had sex for 3 months and even then I was practically having to beg for it. She claims that she just doesn't desire that contact anymore and that it's not something I've ""done wrong"" but that she just doesn't need it. For me, this is a HUGE issue. I need it. Badly. Intimacy is something that I enjoy sharing with someone that I truly am in love with and without it my brain automatically injects thoughts of not being good enough, not being worthy of her love and intimacy, not being the man I once was, etc.

The topic of divorce has been brought up because she knows how important intimacy is to me but she has said, many times, that she does not see it getting better. She's switched birth control and spoke with her doctor about it but we still have not come to any answers other than ""it happens"". I love my wife. I truly do. But, I also believe that we only get this one shot at life and I honestly need that intimacy and love in my life to truly achieve my full level of happiness that I believe I deserve. I'm sorry if I am rambling. Frankly, re-entering the dating world at 32 terrifies me. But, I want to be happy and being intimate with my wife is a really big hole in my life that I need to fill. I am not interested in cheating, so please don't recommend that. Otherwise, advice and thoughts are welcome.

Like many this TIFU didn’t happen today but a few years back. So, what happened is I was in the military, and I was working nights. Due to how my job was we couldn’t go to the Defac because our hours caused us to miss it. Because of that we had to pack our own lunches. When I packed my lunch I made sure to have several days of food. I would pack home cooked meals, fruit chews, chips, and granola bars. 

This time I was trying to eat slightly healthier so I ditched the granolas for fiber one. I throw it all into my overnight bag, and off to work I go. I show up for my 1600 showtime, shoot the shit with my coworkers, and we check out at humvee, And we post out. We get to the location, set up our stations and sit. We’re there for about 2 hours or so, so during that time I decided to have a little snacky snack and to eat one of my home meals especially since we thought it was going to be a short day. Continue to talk with my coworkers and friends, and over the net, we get a message saying we will be there for another eight.

I'm thinking, ok, bet, I'm with good company, it's reasonably warm outside, and the weather is nice. Over those hours, I ended up eating almost all my food. Except some doritos, a banana, and the box of fiber one bars. It's now been 10 hours, and the shift isn’t over yet, and I don’t have much food left. Which for those wondering how did I already eat almost all of my food. When food is just sitting next to you and your bored eating passes time.

Another hour passes and we’re notified over the net that it will be a few more hours but not to fret our relief is coming. Sweet! I ask one of the team leads to see if we were returning to base I get a “yea, and we will be placed on six rings.” So, in other words, I get to go back to base and wait to be called back into work, but other than that, I'm free to do whatever. 

Now I’m excited as shit; I’m so happy in my mind I go well, I can eat the rest of my food since I’m going home. So I eat my Doritos, my banana, and a few fiber one bars, no problem. The oncoming team shows up; we do change over and shoot the shit with oncoming for a little while. I eat the rest of the box of fiber one bars during that time because, as I said, they were pretty good.

We get done talking to oncoming and we dip back to base. The ride is an hour back, so I pop my headphones in and relax. The majority of the ride back was silent and uneventful. We stop for fuel and check and make sure the driver is good to press on. During that time, I felt a little rumble in my stomach, but I paid it no mind.

Everyones good, so we press on to the base, we are about 30 minutes away, and I started to become gassy. I opened the window and eased a few out here and there. The first few rips, I felt fine afterward, but I started getting a mean cramp in my gut, and each fart I let go started to hurt. 

We are getting closer and closer to the base, and with each moment, I felt worse and worse. The cramps were terrible, my farts were hot, and I was starting to sweat. The entire time I'm thinking, “man, what the hell.” I close my eyes and lean my face closer to the window to take my mind off the pain. It worked for a little bit until I felt the unmistakable rumble in my lower intestine, telling me I have to shit.

I speak up and tell the driver straight up, “hey man, I don’t feel good. Can we speed up a little?” The driver probably thought I was going to puke, so they sped up, and to be honest, the way I was feeling, I probably could of. We get to base, we put the humvee up, turn in our gear and head home.

I hop in my car, and I race back to my place the entire time cramping and farting. I park my car, and I get ready with the mindset to run to my apartment. Nope! The minute I stood up, I could tell the next fart I let go was going to be the one, and running would have made it happen sooner.

So I do this weird waddle where I'm clenching my cheeks, and I'm holding my stomach, praying that I make it. Every step I'm dreading because I have to go up two flights of efforts to make it to my bathroom. I waddle up the steps and I make it into my apartment. I hurried up, took my boots and pants off as soon as I got in, and walked to my bathroom.

I don't know why but the moment my feet hit the cold tile of the bathroom; it was like my body knew I was headed for the toilet. At that moment, I could feel it pushing; it felt like if I unclenched my cheeks, bent over, sneezed, or whatever, I would have shat myself.

So I carefully walk over to the toilet and sit down. I relax...nothing, so I rest some more.....nothing. I'm sitting on the toilet, and nothing happened. 

So I relax as much as I could, and that's when it happened. I could feel the little demon knocking on the back door, but there was a problem. I was constipated, and let me tell you, I was BACKED UP!
 
I tried semi squatting no dice, I tried pushing no dice, so I did what I had to. I got up, grabbed a stool to prop my legs up higher so I could be in a better squatting position, and I pushed.
I pushed, relaxed, pushed, relaxed, pushed, relax. I was starting to sweat again, and it was barely coming out. I'm bracing my arms against the mini walls surrounding my toilet, and I'm pushing hard enough to move the bowel movement but not hard enough to make anything else pop out. 

But I can feel the vein in my forehead popping out, my hands are clammy, my back and feet are sweating, my asshole feels like it's being kissed by the Sun, and I wish that I never bought those bars.

Each push felt like it was barely moving, and it hurt like a motherfucker. After a few more grunts and pushes i could feel it moving faster and faster. So at that point i gave one final push and it popped out. The relief that washed over me was amazing. For that split second I forgot I was ever constipated. Until I relaxed and thats when my asshole felt like it was back on fire. But I didn’t care the cramps were gone and I felt so much better besides the the flamin anus.

I don’t know about you all, but after bowel movements, I turn around and see if there are any abnormalities. And there was only one, my poop looked dry. Like, I had no water for days dry. Explains why I was having a hell of a time passing it.

But I flush, wipe, and proceed to shuffle to my shower so I can relax.  Afterward, I laid down and took a nap. I woke up feeling like a new man, and with that, my first stop was Denny’s. That's a fuck up for another day, though.

When we first started dating and eventually had sex, I noticed she didn't really do much. Just missionary for the most part. She also didn't like to moan, have her eyes open, oral, and never changed positions. I pretty much was doing all the work.


Since then, she has told me that her previous sexual encounters has ruined oral sex for her and that is why she doesn't like giving it. As for everything else, she just doesn't find it interesting. She has started to moan here and there but it's not for long and its quiet. She has started to give oral a little more but still not much or for long.


She has had 5x the partners than I have had, and I would say I'm still somewhat new to sex so I would like to explore my sexual preferences. I haven't asked for anything crazy but all I've asked for is for her to let her self be free and trust me and just fully let or souls intertwine. I know that sounds a bit overdramatic, but our sex is below simple missionary.


Lately I've noticed she doesn't like spontaneous sex. Like if I rub her leg or her 'areas' she's never interested or trys to play along. She also only wants sex at night and in the morning. She will dress up in lingerie underwear and bras and show them off to me sexually and then when I ask ""Would you like to have sex?"" Or make moves she's always not interested. She also has never made 1 move towards me. 


She has jokingly said she will give me oral and then when Im like ""oooooh really?"" It's always a no. She has only gotten me off oraly twice and I've gotten her off plenty of times that Idk the number. 


When we are intoxicated she has 0 problems with anything and is so on board with it all and I love that, but I don't need drugs or alcohol to have that kind of sex. I don't rely on it as much as she does.


I haven't thought about breaking it off with her for this because I really love her and besides sex everything is amazing. I'm just starting to get really sexually frustrated and I just don't know how to fix it. I've tried talking to her about it and all she does is say sorry, but nothing really changes.

The first one lasted around 2 ½ years and my current one 1 ½ years and counting (we also dated a year prior making it official).

**Backstory first relationship (TW: sexual abuse)**: In my first relationship things started out fine sexually speaking, we were both inexperienced. Although, over time it progressed into something violating. This started happening as my sex drive went down over time while his remained the same, if not even higher. I was groped, sexually coerced and guilted into sex almost every time I saw him. “No” meant “maybe yes if I try harder”. Without going into too much detail, sexual activities would occur against my will and at times it was physically painful while my mind would be numb. Due to my lack of sexual experience and self-respect I put up with it because I felt like I loved him. He would threaten often that he would break up with me if we didn’t start having intercourse more frequently, so I felt extreme pressure. My sex drive was completely evaporated. 

After breaking up with him (something I should have done a lot sooner) I went to speak with a sex therapist regarding my sex drive. I was curious what was wrong with me, why was my sex drive completely gone? Why was my ability to produce natural lubrication gone? To summarize she told me I had been raped over an extended period, and that it’s not strange in the slightest that my body shut down. It was like something clicked in me, it felt liberating to hear that it wasn’t my fault.  

**Backstory current relationship**: My current boyfriend is completely different thank god. He acts in the way that should be expected from any decent human, no means no and he respects me. When we first met my sex drive came back like a slap in the face, I have never experienced a higher drive in my life, I’d almost label it as hypersexual. I wanted to be intimate almost daily (sometimes multiple) and I was extremely shocked, but I also felt such relief that I was suddenly “normal” again. He would even joke that I was too much for him to keep up with. Of course, with time my drive went down, but I still had a healthy amount of sexual desire and we both were happy. 

A bit of a crux was that I struggled internally with things from my past relationship. Even though my new boyfriend never guilted me I felt like I had to stop myself from saying no too much if I wasn’t in the mood. In my mind I was scared that he’d start giving me the “break up threat” if I wasn’t accepting sexual advances often enough. Eventually we spoke about it in depth and both agreed that it was unhealthy to hold myself to that type of standard. And for both of our sakes to never say yes when I wasn’t in the mood. 

**The problem:** Sometime after having the talk about not saying yes when I wasn’t in the mood, I lost my sex drive. It was unexpected because most of the time that I agreed to sex I was in the mood. Looking back, it’s a blur how and why my drive vanished, I can’t really pinpoint when exactly it happened. What I know now is that I have close to 0% sexual desire, this includes fantasizing on my own. I’m not into anything, no solo stuff, nothing involving other people or my boyfriend. I feel like I’m asexual. The *only time* I feel in the mood is when I’m studying something extremely boring for school and my mind thinks that masturbating for a bit is a good excuse to procrastinate. Think of it as getting a small endorphin-kick. This is still rare, I’d estimate it to be once a month. During these times I’ll look at a quick animated video and there is no desire/fantasy of penetration/foreplay on myself and I don’t think of any real people.

As you can imagine, my boyfriend has been struggling with the fact that at first, I was very sexual, to mediumly sexual and now to nothing at all. He’s remained so very kind and empathetic, never once expressed he may want to leave or that he’s frustrated with me. He’s expressed that of course he wishes I would initiate sometimes (he very rarely does anymore because he knows I don’t want to) but that he doesn’t want to put any pressure on me. What he did say though is that he wishes I would take some sexual photos for him sometimes and that would be enough. Of course, I want to do that for him, but I have a really hard time making myself do it. Getting myself naked without feeling turned on and taking photos just feels so odd. I wish I still had a sex drive, everything would be so much easier, and I know he’d be happier. 

I’m left feeling puzzled and helpless, I feel like I did during my first relationship where I wondered what was wrong with me. But this time the answer isn’t “you were raped”, there simply isn’t an obvious answer. I know some people may chalk it up to “you aren’t compatible, leave” but that wouldn’t solve my problem in the long run. If I have some type of pattern built into me where I start out with a strong sex drive that over time vanishes completely, I won’t be a “match” with anyone.

She got into it due to her previous living situation. We have taken her in, rent free, and have been trying to get her the help she desperately needs. 

We live close to our business and she has been going to get doses not far from us to help her recovery. She has no car because she totaled her car, most likely because she was high. She takes her doses but is still obviously using frequently. She has no problem talking shit about us trying to help her to people we know. We are giving her every opportunity to get clean, and live the life we know she wants. She's always lying about her use, we have told her that we understand that she will still need to use in order for her to get off what she is doing. All we ask is that she is honest so we can work with her. She cannot get into an impatient facility due to covid, and the insurance she has. Shes always lying to her dad about us too. She tells him that we dont pay her for working at our business, and she never eats because there isnt food at our home. Either me or my husband cook every night, and always make enough for her. When she is at work, we always but her lunch.

I'm so lost and honestly need guidance. If this is all over the place and out of order I'm sorry, I'm just out of options and I really need to get this off my chest.

For a while I've been trying to work through a shit ton of trauma and I'm kinda at a breaking point.

I'm 16 years old, I grew up/am growing up in a very shattered family dynamic. Part of this is because of my biological mom, my stepmom, and my dad.

Growing up, until about the age of 14, my dad and biological mom had joint custody of me. I spent the weekends (Fri-Sun) with my biological mom, who we'll call ""Farrah"" (39f) and weekdays (Mon-Thurs) with my dad, ""Jack"" (40m) and stepmom ""Lauren"" (40f). I also have an older brother, ""Michael"" (21m)

Farrah is a heavy smoker, deathly overweight, multiple mental disorders, manipulative, narcissistic, and aggressive.

Jack is overall a decent dad and my favorite of all three, he just comes from a place of anger despite the circumstances. He never gets physical and has never hit me, but sometimes it worries me. He also drinks quite a bit, but has NEVER been an aggressive drunk towards me or my family.

Lauren is one of the current main problems in my house. She gets over-emotional and cries on cue to get what she wants and manipulates/gaslights the hell out of everyone. She's right or nobody's right. She's always the victim, and no one is allowed to say otherwise.

Michael is older than me by about 5 years, and we only just started getting close and bonding about 2 years ago when he started driving and we started hanging out more, and going for drives, and talking about stuff that we couldn't really talk about with other people.

Now that you know everyone, let's get started on where this all began.

Growing up, we were pretty generationally poor. Straight up out of the ghetto in Michigan, and considered ""white trash"" from trailer parks.

We continually were moving back and forth between Michigan and the south until we settled here in the south when I was about 2 years old. To this day I've moved about 15 times since I was born.

Farrah never understood boundaries, slept all the time, screamed at us, emotionally abused, and emotionally exploited me and my brother for years. Druggies in and out of the apartments we lived in, which were trashed with her hoarder lifestyle, with no paths to walk through. I couldn't sleep in my own room because that's where the housed druggies, and severely mentally ill people stayed.
Men were also in and out of her life, she had boyfriends in and out of the house for most of my life. And it often fucked with the way I viewed people and my trust for anyone to this day.

At Jack and Lauren's house, it was a better environment, still not a good one, but better, up until about 3 years ago, when Farrah moved back to Michigan indefinitely to ""get her life together"" (which surprise, surprise, has not happened) leaving me to full custody at my dad and stepmom's house.

The one thing I will always have respect and be grateful for, is the fact that no matter what, my dad always made sure there was food on the table and a roof over our heads. No matter what it took he ALWAYS made sure we had those. Most moments he was nurturing and made sure we had what we needed. It was only as we got older that he became angry because he gave up on himself.

To this day I still have trouble being a kid. All my parents were always acting like children so I was always the bigger person. I can't trust them, I don't tell them anything about my personal life (friendships, relationships, school, etc) and they don't really ask.

Farrah was and still very much is a runner. She runs away when things get hard, and has walked out of my life for months at a time, and now years, about 4 times since I was in third grade.

Made promises, broke them.

Got my hopes up, let me down.

It's a cycle with all my parents.

""I'll take you to get [necessity]!"" Or ""I gotta book this [doctor appointment] for you!"" And it never gets done.

I know that with COVID this stuff has been post poned, but it's the fact that they don't even call or try to book an appointment to get me taken care of. I still have yet to go to the eye doctor (for really horrible eyesight) for new glasses, dentist for 3 cavity fillings after a year, general doctor for check ups, therapy, updated learning disability test, etc.

I hit rock bottom a few summers ago (I was about 13 or 14) when I went to visit some family in another state. My stepmom's family invited us to stay with them in their home for a week or so. Among the family staying there, (aunt, uncle, and a few cousins), my stepmom's other sister, sent her kids from Maine to come stay with them as well. Two boys, one my age ""Henry"" (13/14m) and one a little older than me, ""Trent"" (15m).

The night before we were supposed leave, we were staying in my cousins who lived there room. They shared a room, and me and Trent were on sleeping pallets on the same side of the room. We both decided to split from the group at about 2am, seeing as everyone else was asleep and we couldn't manage to. We decide to go downstairs to watch TV on the big TV and get some snacks and chill out down there and maybe play some video games quietly.

After going to the bathroom, and getting some water, I sat down on the couch beside him and grabbed a controller. He then continued to throw the idea of having sex at me. And I said no, got up, and went to go walk upstairs, before I could he grabbed me by my wrist slammed me down on the couch and pinned me down.

I was terrified. I've been one of the smaller kids all my life. Generally been the same height and since about 5th grade (5'4), and extremely skinny with next to no muscle. Trent has always been athletic, about 6'2 at the time, and about 70 pounds heavier than me. Forced himself on me, and sexually assaulted me for what felt like forever.

He got up, pulled up his boxers, looked at me, and told me to not tel anyone or it would not end well and, I quote, ""no one would believe [me] anyways because [he's] actually a biological member of the family.""

Since then I've told no one except for my best friend. I cried telling the story and I was extremely upset.

Ive mainly tried to move past it, but to this day the part that really sickens me, is that I believed him, because it was true.

No one probably would've believed me. And no one probably would've cared.

I need encouragement that I can move past all of these trust issues. Through all of these worries, and these sleepless nights of wondering why this shit happens. My trust issues, my jealousy, my anxiety, my worry that everyone is gonna walk away, that I'll ever be enough.

I've trusted reddit enough to ask and reach out for help. I just need advice on how to move past this.

Thank you.

Obligatory this didn't happen to me today but rather on Christmas morning 2020. 

It was the first Christmas my girlfriend and I really got to do it up. Our son was around 15 months old at the time so we wanted to make it really special for him. 

For fear that he would start unwrapping the brightly colored shiny boxes under the tree, we decided to stash all of the presents in a spare room we have. The plan was to wake up extra early on Christmas morning, put all the presents under the tree, and wait for him to wake up.

Well the plan went off without a hitch. We woke up super early and got everything taken care of in about 15 minutes. It is now 6:45 AM and son is still out cold. I decided to go try and lay down to catch another 20-30 minutes of sleep, and my gf wanted to wait up for the kid. 

This is where it starts to go downhill. I go and lay down, but I quickly realize that I will not be going back to sleep. So I think to myself maybe we can have a little early morning ""roll in the hay"" if you will. So I decided that I'm gonna send m'lady a dick pic.

Now I, being the mostly out of touch millennial that I am, don't use snapchat that often. But I do know that people often use it to send nudes. Therefore, I decided to channel my inner young person and take care of this with modern technology.

After a few attempts I finally got what I thought was a pretty nice dick pic. Good lighting, angle, you guys know what I'm talkin about. I then add the words ""You want some Christmas dick?"" to the snap. 

While reviewing placement of the words, I decided that it wasn't festive enough. At first I thought there might be a Christmas light sticker, but I settled on a bow.

Here is the problem with being an old millennial and almost never using snapchat. I was looking around for the button that adds a sticker to the picture. Ya know that little button in the bottom left corner that looks like a little square with a + in the corner? Well my brain was like, oh hey that looks like an add sticker button. I tapped the button and it was gone. My glorious tribute to my manhood had zoomed off to lands unknown and I had no idea where. 

Immediately I started panicking. I quickly checked my story but I didn't see anything. Then I replicated what I had done but with a picture of the wall instead. Pressed the same button and ""poof"" it was gone. I then went back to my story and.... there it was. In all of its triumphant glory. 

Luckily, the view counter still said ""0"" and luckier still, I somehow knew how to delete a snapchat from your story. Just as quickly as it had come in to this world it was taken out. 

After my heartbeat reached a semi normal rate, I decided to get back in the saddle again and re do my masterpiece. Mission successful. After a good laugh with my gf, we ended up having a nice pre Christmas morning. 

I know the view counter said 0. But I wonder if someone, who was hoping to see pictures of our son on Christmas morning, opened my story. Only to be met with a very festive dick pic. Nobody has said anything yet so I guess we will see.

And now, every once in awhile, my head will randomly say ""want some Christmas dick?"" and I burst out laughing.

I'm a little bit older but he is definitely my rock. He is stable. He's predictable. He is really smart and has a well-paying job that he enjoys. He is the epitome of calm and patient while I am definitely not. His predictability is a good thing for our relationship overall; I was a bit wild before we met and he's brought stability. We have a beautiful house in a lovely town,  two cars, and financial stability - something I never thought I would have as a young gay. We also have fun - we've traveled all over the world together and share a number of similar hobbies. 

He's pretty much the perfect guy - with the exception of the bedroom. Even that's not the worst. But it is eating at me and I need help talking to him about this because I really don't want to hurt him. 

His predictable behavior unfortunately extends to the bedroom. There is near zero variance in the time of day when we'll have sex (930pm-11pm) and usually the day of the week. It will usually be pitch black but sometimes I light a candle. 

I can also tell you the position we'll have sex in; since we've been together, he's only been willing to have sex in one position. He just lays there, flat on his back. Every time. He's never wanted to receive penetrative sex so if there's penetration involved, it is 100% my responsibility. Gay sex usually involves some preparation; if it happens I buy the supplies, I prep in advance. I do most of the physical activity - he's laying on his back. I always have to finish first and then he finishes himself off. When it is over, I have to get the towel and clean us up. 

I think it is important to reiterate that this is the pattern every single time we have sex. Not 9 out of 10 times, not 75% and I'm just exaggerating and needy. Every time. If I only count the years we've been married, sex at least once a week, thats at least 260 times.

This depiction may make him sound selfish but I just don't think that's it. During the sex, he always seems focused on my orgasm and wants me to enjoy it. He's not pounding into me focused only on himself and then nodding off - it isn't like that at all. He's generous and supports me in many ways outside the bedroom. 

I do enjoy the sex but I need more. I've tried to introduce new things - I've bought toys, handcuffs, creative lube, poppers, sexy underwear.  I got him a creative gay sex coupon book. I've tried to have sex on our sofa, in our guest room. I tried to have sex on our patio at a hotel. I've tried to switch roles. He's shut it all down or tried it once and didn't like it, said it was not his thing. 

I'm not looking for us to put a dungeon in our house or start attending sex parties but I need more. The sex just isn't fun or spontaneous. I know I really shouldn't complain; I have a great relationship I should be thankful for. But this is really eating at me and I'm worried I'm starting to resent him for being prudish and unwilling to try new things. 

I've started watching more porn and taking care of myself. I've even started reading romance novels because I find the sex and passion in them thrilling. He found out what I was reading and made fun of me; I regret not using that opportunity to talk to them about this and I just kept quiet. Cheating really isn't an option; the thought of being with someone else makes me physically sick but I admit I have had dirty chats with random anon people online. I honestly don't want to be with anyone else - I just want him. 

I need to figure out how to address this with him without hurting him. Physically, I enjoy the sex but there's just no fun or spontaneity in it; I could likely have as much fun solo with less effort.

Back story: I was working in the ER at the time, and had several syringes of sterile normal saline at home, which I brought from work. I mostly used these to clean the scratches I would acquire from indoor/outdoor cats (originally feral then domesticated), and I would fill some of them up with isopropyl alcohol after using up the normal saline, as a way to conveniently clean wounds with alcohol (as I learned shortly after, it's not necessary at all to clean wounds with alcohol). I'm mildly allergic to cats as well but they're so goddamn cute and I can't help but love them, so figured I could just deal with cleaning the minor scratches.

  
I come home one morning after working a night shift. One of the cats had diarrhea'd on the carpet, so I brought out the stain removal cleaning solution. It was jammed, and upon trying to fix the cap, I accidentally sprayed it up into the air. I thought I got some in my eye, so I removed my contact immediately and grabbed a normal saline syringe to irrigate my eyeball. I put the syringe up to my eye and felt a tingle, so I thought, ""ah, definitely got some of that stain removal in my eye, better clean it out with some saline.""

It just happened to be the ONE syringe that I put alcohol in. 

My eyeball immediately began to burn intensely and I proceeded to rinse my eye out with regular tap water out of panic. It felt like I was doing it for 5 minutes but probably not. I walked over to my roommate, who was sleeping, and asked her to drive me back up to the ER where I worked. 

I was treated with antibiotic eye ointment, as well as some tetracaine for the pain. Sent home, and for days I was in excruciating pain and fear, unable to sleep. I went to the eye specialist in the next couple of days (this happened on a Friday night so the specialist was not open over the weekend) who informed me that I burned off about 3/5 of my cornea. He had to physically shave off the remaining lips of the cornea so he could smoothly apply a bandage contact which I would keep on for 4-5 days. 

Somehow, I never suffered any permanent damage except for a bit of emotional trauma. I thought I was going to be blind in my right eye. I'm fine now though. And I have since learned not to replace NS with alcohol, and not to clean my wounds with alcohol.   


TL;DR - thought I was irrigating my eye with normal saline but it turned out to be isopropyl alcohol, burned off 3/5 of my cornea, had days of non-stop pain and no sleep, but I'm all G now.",0,0,tifu,t5_2to41,nsfw,TIFU by squirting 90% isopropyl alcohol directly into my eye,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/kp239b/tifu_by_squirting_90_isopropyl_alcohol_directly/,promo_adult_nsfw,23.0

I was having achat with some super old friends I hadn’t spoke  to for like 7 years who had just gotten into PC gaming. We get some catching up and where we’re at in life and playing some games together.
I check my phone to see that my girlfriend sent me a snap. I open the snap to see a few nude and sexy photos of her. Of course at that point I’m like “heck yeah” and somewhat return the favour with a few half-assed pictures, not fully “ready” in the pictures I send her. I also explained to her that I was having a chat with my friends, but I don’t think she got what I really meant. She also rarely sends nudes and we are together a lot. She also isn’t the most comfortable with her own body.
She suddenly stops answering and I ask her what was up. She said that by not answering her snaps with some equally sexy pictures and by not screenshotting her snaps, that it made her feel unappreciated and uncomfortable to continue sending pictures.
Of course I understood why she reacted that way, and I tried to explain to her what I was doing at the time and that meant that I wasn’t going to just leave my friends hanging for 5-10 minutes just to send something appropriate back. She said she felt like I wasn’t showing my attraction towards her and that she felt disgusting for sending anything in the first place.
We’ve been talking and chatting for over an hour with me saying how it wasn’t her that wasn’t attractive, it was just an unfortunate timing and I wasn’t really “in the mood” at that time. She argued that her pictures were supposed to get me “in the mood”, which I totally agree with.

I honestly understand her frustration, but I have explained to her so many times just how much the timing was terrible for this type of thing. She also argued that if she were to be naked on my bed, that I wouldn’t leave my game to be with her. 
Hopefully I got both sides of the story pretty good to make you understand. I just want to know what to do now to not make this super awkward between us.

Edit: We have a curfew now because of COVID so I can’t physically see her until tomorrow after work.

We think it'll help process it if there's a term we can put it under, similar to any mental health disorders.

After the first experience of coercion and rape, it had been settled in her mind that sexual interactions worked in that way, my girlfriend very much blamed herself. The second boy had set himself up in a way, and openly expressed that he planned to date her, and that he wanted that relationship. From an outside perspective (not all details included here) he was very aware of a situation she was coping with in her home life regarding an absent dad (for reference, it is an ongoing realisation that he's not emotionally attached (narcissist). He also used physical violence whilst she was growing up to correct behaviour he deemed incorrect) - who she also blames herself for leaving, and used it to take advantage. He was dismissive of her emotional needs, and often moved conversations inappropriately over to his sexual 'needs', often pointing out (summed up) that when you're moving towards a relationship, you should provide 'favours' (referring to sexual acts). She never wanted to have those interactions with him, but whenever she seemed reluctant he would laugh and play it down - she would feel as if she's being immature (she's a year older than him) and had a role to fill. He never provided anything for her, neither did he want to. He would ask her not to tell any friends or family about them, he wouldn't want to be seen with her in public. There was an account of him seeing her in public with her friends, and acting like they were strangers. Essentially, tricked into believing she owed him pleasure, and that's how 'relationship' dynamics work. To the public eye, there's no trace that they even knew each other. After a while, he had eventually changed tones to 'you know this is just a friend thing' - which would only be said after they had done something. He would then ignore her for ages, leave her saying she missed him, for him only to return occasionally for nudes. Notably, he would make her beg (which she was uncomfortable with). She felt scared, she felt terrified of him but didn't want to confront that idea. Is there any kind of label for this? She needs clarification or a term to be able to say he did something wrong - else she's showing strong signs of instability.

In the first account I mentioned, it was rape orally (I've provided the top definition at the bottom of the post). She thought she was just meeting him for a walk, but he insisted they sat down, despite her being confused and just wanting to walk. He asked her if she had done anything before, she hadn't. He then ran his hand up her thigh towards her crotch (wearing a skirt). She moved his hand off, asking him to not do it. He then repeated it and she took it off with more force, saying please can you stop doing that now. He kept persisting, playing it down and begging her to do it. She felt as if she had to abide by him, and used her mouth. He was forceful, holding her head down, she never wanted to do it in the first place, but thought it would make him get of her to stop touching her. She never said yes, it was done out of fear for her own safety.

To re-iterate - 'She needs clarification or a term to be able to say he did something wrong - else she's showing strong signs of instability - on both accounts'.

*""The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.""*

Edit - I felt as if I should quickly add, this girl is the most caring and loving person I have ever met. She is who you’d want to raise your daughter to be like, and she is completely innocent and unready for something like this - she was forced to grow up, taken as a child when she wasn’t ready. Surrounding the first incident, she even believed she was made pregnant from a blowjob as she missed a period - to the point she had to tell him and get a pregnancy test.

We met a few weeks ago and he seems like a really good person. We have very similar interests, morals and future plans. He’s the first person I’ve dated in a while and honestly one of the nicest. I think he’d get on with all my family and friends. Things are looking good! It’s obviously very early on in the relationship but I can see this progressing into a serious relationship. 

Now the issue. After a couple of weeks we tried to get physical. It being a new relationship we took our time but when we came down to it he couldn’t get hard. At all. I just thought it was a bit of nerves and reassured him that it didn’t matter these things happen. He’s very considerate and made sure that I was satisfied, which is a first! Since then we have tried several times with the same result. He says this has only ever happened once before and it lasted a week or so and then things were back to normal. We’ve tried oral, kissing, spooning, basically everything we can think of to keep it nice and relaxed. I’m very understanding of the situation and reassure him that there’s always next time. But I’m beginning to doubt if this is a one time issue. I have a high sex drive and while I’m okay with waiting I’m starting to worry if this is a long term problem. While he makes sure I’m satisfied either way, it’s not really my thing and would rather skip to the main event. He also does this thing where he just rubs himself on me to try to get hard and kiss for like half an hour, but it’s starting to make me cringe.

I should mention that it doesn’t seem to be a physical issue. As in, he rarely drinks, doesn’t do drugs, eats healthy and exercises every day.

I can’t go on forever like this and I’m worried the longer I wait the more attached we both get and either I end up hurting him by ending it, eventually feeling unsatisfied and frustrated or I end up in a sexless relationship. I know this sounds rather shallow but I can’t have a sexless relationship. But then I feel awful for having doubts about if this is going to work. I really do like him. I’m just not sure where to go from here. What can I do to make it better? Do I put a timeframe on it?

i only have 1 hesitation, and thats the sex. every time we see each other (every 2-4 days) we have sex, often multiple times a night. he cums... every time. i dont. i never have. it usually starts out with me massaging him or scratching him, maybe ill go down on him for a little bit, he'll tease me a bit, and then he gets inside me. and he cums. and i don't. i love when he penetrates me, it feels great, but not as much recently and i think its because my not cumming is making me feel resentful. 

i can cum on my own just fine. when hes around, ive tried using a toy but still couldnt cum! his hands do nothing for me, he doesnt like my taste (the one time he tried to go down on me, he made a disgusted face and spit into the trash can. its not a question of hygiene or anything, i know that. i always clean myself properly right before i see him.). i mentioned a few days ago that i would appreciate if he would try again to give me head, but ive gotten nothing yet. hes rather vanilla, but i have a lot of stuff i wanna try. i told him i would do absolutely anything he wanted. i'd try it, at least. yet he won't even try to give me head?

the other night, he was being rather ""dominant"" with me, pinning me down as i struggled (not really something im into but ill do it for him). he tried to pin my arms behind me, but ended up hurting me really badly. i told him, no, no, no, and he stopped immediately and began profusely apologizing. i kinda ended up being the one to console him, even though he physically and mentally hurt me, lmao. but i told him accidents happen sometimes, its okay, im not hurt, need to communicate more, etc etc. he was thrilled that i wasnt mad or anything.

but ever since then i cant really get the incident out of my head. it just feels unfair. i'm a very sexual person and ive never been able to cum. if its a mental block, then id like him to really try to make me feel comfortable enough to get in a headspace to receive pleasure. i just feel like i'm missing something big. it makes me feel disconnected from him. it makes me so sad and angry. i'm tired of masturbating after he leaves. if the roles were reversed, and i was him, i would feel ashamed i haven't made my partner cum, and i would do a n y t h i n g to make that happen. would he do the same for me?

how do i talk to him about this? how do i handle this situation? i feel like he'd be open to a discussion, i think. i know it's difficult for a man to hear he isn't pleasing his woman. but he knows he never makes me cum. that doesn't bother him? so does he just not want to put in the effort? i love this man so much, and he loves me. this is the only question i have in the relationship, and its extremely important to me.",0,0,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,nsfw,How do I (20f) talk to my boyfriend (21m) about my sexual needs?,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/l72xna/how_do_i_20f_talk_to_my_boyfriend_21m_about_my/,promo_adult_nsfw,6.0

I check out like anime porn comics, play porn games, I have an account dedicated to finding my fav videos in a porn site. I always thought there will be no trouble whatsoever. 

Back then, I got hard easily, so easily. Like sometimes just by seeing a bikini pic, but due to my porn addiction, I need to find something really tempting, like a story. If the porn doesn't feel at least a bit possible I don't like it, that's why I started playing porn games and comics. I started getting turned off by basic porn and started delving deeper to my kind of porn, it was excruciatingly terrible how much I  needed for stimulation.

And this is when my gf came. She was amazing, and she loves sex. We both have high sex drives, except I became so desensitized I've been having trouble getting hard, to the point she sometimes asks if I don't find her attractive. I do, I just can't muster the drive to actually get hard because of how addicted I was in porn.

I work out pretty regularly, I stopped eating anything like junk food or soft drinks or sweets years ago. I don't smoke or drink. I try to get enough sleep everyday, so I felt like I would be a sex god, but I noticed long ago that I stopped getting random boners or getting turned on by the simplest things.

Another problem I found was covid, because we were always inside, my main attraction of the day was always just porn. Before covid, I had to go long hours in school and in the gym, and I get horny and get boners easily because I didn't watch porn and could only see hot girls and feel attracted. Us being locked up inside made me dive deeper into my addiction.

Starting a month back I have stopped consuming any form of pornography, deleted my videos, pics, games and I thought it would fix my issues quick, but no, just yesterday my gf kept trying to get me hard but it wouldn't no matter what.

I want to fix this issue somehow, since it's making me feel so anxious and frustrated as if I failed her as a man.

I really hope that she isn’t faking this and I really want to supportive of any medical or psychological issues she has. As someone whose gone through therapy and mental issues myself (explained later), I want to supportive for her and help in anyway I can, but it’s getting hard.

So my sister is a long term liar. She’s lied about parts of her life and has gotten caught for it for many years. She’s spent years psychologically abusing me and wearing me down until I became suicidal and had to go to therapy. I’ve tried telling her this (as a part of my treatment), but she replied with her usual, “It’s all in your head, your the one that’s been physically and mentally abusing me”. She degraded me until it only took a couple words to break me down and it’s still this way. She gaslighted me to think myself a person that wasn’t worth the space I occupy, that I’d never be good enough for anyone, that no one deserves to be with a loser like me. She isolated me from as many people I know by telling them lies about me, telling them that I abuse her and that I was a horrible person, she constantly tells people that I’m a horrible musician and how she has to suffer over my playing which lead to me hating myself when I became the top performing musician in my state at the age of 17. It made me feel like an imposter, that it wasn’t true, some fluke, a mistake that I ended up where I did. I now know that it’s not true, but it almost stopped me from going after my degrees in music.

This whole incident started with stomach aches. We spent months dealing with them, taking her to specialists, driving anywhere that would do tests and after a year, not a single thing was found wrong with her medically. These stomach aches continued for a year and a half and it became very apparent what the trigger for them was. When she was in an argument with someone. Whether it was a friend, arguing with our parents, or abusing me mentally, whenever something didn’t go her way she would get them. There would be weeks where there wasn’t a problem and weeks where she hid in her bedroom because she wasn’t happy with someone. Then one day poof. They disappeared. She didn’t have one for a whole year. Then for one weekend, when she was about to be grounded for being caught lying and they haven’t come back in the year since.

She started therapy with a psychiatrist a couple months ago for some reason (not my place to know if she doesn’t want to tell me). And with it, my family has asked to talk about her stomach problems and her grades with the psychiatrist. We can’t know but if I had to guess, she doesn’t.

Recently she’s started failing classes and she been getting in trouble for more lying about her grades. Last weekend, she went on a trip after saying that she was caught up (she went into the inspector and changed the numbers) and when she got back they found out she was still failing her classes. On top of that she started yelling at my father so he took her car away. When having to explain to my mom why she got grounded and her car taken away, she said “I don’t remember”. When asked to clarify she responded “I don’t remember that day”. It was so hard to just not roll my eyes and chew her out. I just said “If you are losing hours of your memory, you need to go to the hospital now”. She responded with one of the demeaning triggers she trained into me and said “OK” while rolling her eyes(I learned that it was a thing she programmed into me over the years to gaslight me and break me down psychologically as well as stop whatever point or idea I had).

What should I do. What do I do. I care for her, but this is just going to far. And how do I deal with her still abusing me because it’s getting worse.

The first girl I dated was in my last year of university and we both were totally into each other and long story short we both started to have more sexual tension towards each other and ended up in bed. Sadly she had a condition called vaginitis which causes her to have pain when insertion. ( pardon my vague definition im not an expert). But luckily theres more than insertion in sexual intercourse , but for some reason I m unable to ejaculate or even feel the slightest satisfaction as she would or at least i hoped. Let’s be serious about sexuality as I am most definitely straight or at least I think so, as I am very attracted to women cause I get very much in the mood. This became an issue in sexual interactions because the significant other would feel that I didnt feel as in love or into her.

So, after this relationship ended, I thought maybe its because i just wasn’t that into her, which is completely unhealthy of a way of thinking. I truly was devastated that she ended things with me. This lead to me getting a fling with another girl and the same thing happened where i couldn’t relieve myself and this time it was fully insertion intercourse. I started to believe something was wrong with me. 

I started to talking to another girl, which i had many feelings for in the past and we definitely felt it for each other and ultimately ended in bed. Low and behold, I couldn’t feel much and I couldn’t release the slightest. I don’t think anything is wrong with my little guy downstairs as i am able to relieve myself weekly. Im so confused on whats happening and would love to hear any advice.

She wanted to have sex earlier on than me but when I asked for us to get to know each other first she was really respectful of that which was great.

Anyway, I'm starting to think that I feel comfortable enough with her now, but I'm not sure what the social norm is on discussing sex with a partner before actually having sex. Like, for one I haven't told her I'm a virgin yet (a little nervous about her potential reaction to that, honestly) - other than that, I have no idea what positions she likes, if she wants me to moan, take it nice and slow, soft and gentle or rough and hard, leading or following, etc.

Is it weird for me to want to discuss these things with her ahead of time? When / how is an appropriate way/time to bring up these topics, while we're having dinner? Right before we go into the bedroom? When we're in the bedroom and cuddling?

I might be overthinking this, but I'm very bad at understanding social norms and knowing when to bring up a topic...",0,0,NoStupidQuestions,t5_2w844,nsfw,[nsfw] Is it normal to have a lot of discussions with someone about sex before actually having sex with them?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/kq1oso/nsfw_is_it_normal_to_have_a_lot_of_discussions/,promo_adult_nsfw,12.0

I'm 24f if that matters. We'll call my aunt Susan, my cousins, Jack and Jill and I'll refer to my mom as such. Susan is a single mother and my cousins' father have been in and out since Jill was born. Susan was one of those persons who was okay with using the belt so to speak. In retrospect, her beatings probably erred on the side of abuse, but corporal punishment is unfortunately prominent in the Caribbean. Throughout their lives, Susan proved to be a strict and difficult mother. Now, Jill is in university and Jack has just finished high school. He's been the more rebellious one. There have been many incidents of Susan pushing her kids to their limit, by the way she put them down, the way she sheltered and tried to control them, forcing them into extra curriculars that they did not enjoy. These are just to name a few. Things came to a head a couple months ago, maybe in November, Jack was found with a small vape, their mother was furious and smashed it with a hammer and called him terrible things. My mom and I are unsure if she hit him or tried to. This was Jack's breaking point. He shut down and completely shut Susan out not even addressing her to say good day. All this while the 3 of them lived together. Now, I want to interject here and say that Jack and Jill's father has been there for them financially and been a larger support when they got older. Jack had some troubles as a teen with Susan and lived with his father for a bit. During this current time, Jack has been living with his mother, I am not clear on the details as I myself was living in another country for a couple years. Jack perhaps, could've easily gone back to his father, even with the covid regulations in our country, (Remember, Caribbean, so small islands) however, because all 3 of them are home, he preferred to stick around for Jill in case of anything with their mother. The main incident that has caused this little family to split apart, occurred a little before christmas and then before new years. Some of the details are still blurry as my mom and I got condensed versions of what happened. Essentially, Jill wanted to go look at some drive through lights with a couple friends (Within covid regulations). She asked her mom who said to ask her dad and if he said yes it would be fine, but it made no sense to ask her dad because her mom made more of a fuss and he wasn't living with them in the first place. Jill didn't even bother to ask and took her mom's previous statement as a yes. Her dad showed up to their house for something, i think to drop off food, and Susan mentioned Jill going out to him, he of course had no knowledge of this, but also was not upset about not knowing. He believe that Jill is a responsible young adult and knows how to conduct herself. An argument ensued between Jill and Susan.  This is the incident that occurred before Christmas and Jill suspects is the catalyst for her mother's outburst a few days later. Jack and Jill have locks on their rooms, but their mother keeps the spare keys to them. She goes into their rooms at will and does not show any regard for their privacy, even as young adults. The morning of the second incident, Susan went into Jill's room, and told her terrible things. ""get out of my house so you can go s\*ck c\*ck."" ""you'll only get anywhere in life by f\*cking man"" things along this vein (also I'm paraphrasing). Jill tried to argue back as well not even sure where this came from and why it was happening. Understandably she was hurt. Susan tried to hit her, but Jill held her hand and told her no. She tried to lock herself in her room, but ofc susan got the key and got in to continue to berate her more. Eventually, Jack and Jill got a hold of their father and he picked them up.  Jill forgot her glasses at Susan's a couple days later, but was also on her way to run an errand and just had to stop to grab them. She called Susan before she left home by her dad, and said she was on her way for her glasses. Susan said to get the rest of her stuff too. Jill said she didn't have the time right now and that she would do it another day. When she arrived at Susan's all of Jack and Jill's stuff were in garbage bags and their rooms almost completely cleaned out. Susan mixed up their clothes and mixed it with dirty and clean clothes too so they had to wash everything. Mom and I listened to Jack and Jill in horror at what their mother did to them. We offered our support, but they are still very closed up kids, understandably so. Before we got the full account of info, Susan called my mother and told her that Jill and her got in a fight and Jill said ""not even your own sister like you, she bad talks you with the rest of family."" My mom checked with Jill on this and corrected that she actually said ""not even your own family and friends like you , this is why they don't talk to you."" Susan is known to twist stories, and from the beginning we were skeptical of what Susan claimed Jill said. My mom is not one to like drama, she prefers a quiet life, but it breaks our hearts to know that this is what my cousins have gone through. My mom's thing against speaking up to Susan is because she acts extremely... unhinged. She has never taken to advice on how to raise her kids, she does not like to be told that she is wrong, she is entitled and I should've probably codenamed her Karen, but I digress, I'm ranting now. I'll try to wrap this up. My mom does not feel it is her place. At the end of it, we also need her because my grandmother is not in the best of health, and we are not financially well off. Each time my grandmother needs assistance, my mom and her siblings pool together what they can. Mom holds no friendly relationship with Susan, she loathes her for what she has done to Jack and Jill all their lives, but she will not say something outright, unless Susan says something first. Given all of the circumstances, my grandmother's health being the biggest, we are trying to avoid drama as much as possible. Jack and Jill are currently flourishing at their dad's place. They have quite a bit of fixing up to do as Jill has never lived there and never really had a place of her own there. They seem happy, but I still feel they are distant and I also would like advice on how I could get them to understand that I mean what I say when I tell them that I am here for them.

I just drank my problems away and refused to even acknowledge the fact he was gone.

Me and my boyfriend have been really close to each other for 2 years since we're 8th grade. The time when he was 14 (close to 15) and I was 13. He's been the most attractive and also the best guy for me especially of how much he treated me nicely.

But then I was shocked to find out he was positive on COVID back in November and I was hoping he'll survive, but sadly, he didn't. He died about 3 weeks later on December about a week before Christmas and I was really broken that he didn't make it on Christmas and even new year. 

I have kinda moved on but still feel hurt but then I noticed something; before his death, he was jerking off with some random guy on instagram. I found out because I was clearing the browsing data on the chrome on my laptop and found at the search history when before his death back in October, he forgot to log out his instagram on my laptop and I didn't even cared as I barely use instagram at all. Sometimes, he's careless to forget logging out his social media accounts on my laptop so it's no surprise he does this. 

I checked on the instagram and saw him sexting with a guy [18M] and I felt disgusted seeing that they shared dick pics to each other. He's been chatting with this guy since August and his last message was on November, about a few days he got covid. The other guy sent a message yesterday of being worried why he hasn't replied for a while as my boyfriend did not informed him about getting covid.

My parents are divorced and i spend majority of my time at my dads house. I grew up in a very hyper christian household so you can imagine the conflict that occurred when i came out as a lesbian. Happened a few years back, shit happened, trauma was made, not important to the story, my family has gotten over it. but because of my sexuality my parents like to monitor who im talking to very closely and whenever i talk about a new friend, they always ask their sexuality. I am in a relationship with the woman (I hope) im going to marry right now but she is off at college in chicago. So we constantly talk over the phone and text and stuff like that. Some nights when we are talking, things get a little...frisky. To put this next part as vaguely as possible, our relationship in bed is the farthest thing from vanilla. Sadly, since we are apart right now there's not much we can do to help each other out in that way. Which is why i bought sex toys. I have my own job, I used my own money, and bought some stuff to try to make our bedroom time a little more easier. Things were good for awhile but of course my mom found my toys while going through my room. We had a talk, ended with my mom basically saying I am not allowed to masturbate at her house. I am thinking thats fine because i spend majority of time with my dad anyways. That brings us to today. last night my girlfriend and i had our time together and in the morning i got up for work and went. I get to my job and realize my wallet is not in the pocket i usually put it in.  Not a big deal. I text my dad if he could grab my wallet from my room and bring it to me. you can see where this is going. I did not put my bedtime ""fun"" away properly. My dad sends me a picture of a butt plug and asks ""can you explain this?"" I just about shit myself. He then calls me saying he can't find my wallet anywhere but he found the rest of my sexy time stuff and we will have a ""real long talk"" later. A few frantic calls to my girlfriend and best friend later I am a messy ball of anxiety crying scared of what my dad is going to do or say. After successfully lowering my heart rate to a normal speed i go to get my headphones out of my bag and guess what falls out? my wallet. it was in another pocket of my bag.

tl;dr - my dad found my sex toys in my room when i asked him to grab my wallet. And I had my wallet with me the entire time

Ended with him saying he is in a very awkward position as a dad and he would prefer i not do stuff ""like that"" again. He was more concerned with the fact that i had taken one of his chocolate bars and eaten it in my room and he found the wrapper. if i do THAT again i am getting my car taken away.

I was one of these ""I'll wait for the right people kinda of person"" but the person never came(I did get close with someone but it never happened because I also fucked up that time) also I'm so shy I can't talk to people that I don't know well at all.

So since the end of last year I was thinking about paying a hooker to get this sex thing out of my mind and be done with it so I was browsing hookers since mid December-ish looking for ""the perfect"" one to do the job using the virgin meter I wanted a 10/10 girl to take it.

Browsing in my city(Rio de Janeiro) reveled a great total of 0 10/10 girls that I was interested I did find some 8/10 and 9/10 but still not enough for me the virgin loser to grow balls to do it.

But then something happened I'm having a business trip to São Paulo Brazil's biggest city so I started browsing for hookers in the city when I found [HER](https://imgur.com/a/948g02K) as soon as I got my eyes on her something told THIS is the one the perfect 10/10 just look at her she's so fucking adorable I would probably die from cuteness if I got too close to her and if you didn't knew São Paulo is know for having a lot of mixed people from around the world not only Asians, I also did some reverse google image search to look for a possible fake account but couldn't find anything.

After I was done with work I message her and did I forgot to tell that I easily get anxiety? So I was already nervous just by messaging her, I asked if she was free and how much she was charging.

She told me she was free and it was R$250 which is around $50 doesn't look like it's much but it's  1/4 Brazil's minimum wage and a hooker charging this price would be considered a ""luxury hooker"" or a professional hooker type of thing you could easily find cheaper hookers for 20 dollars but my virgin ass wanted this one so I told her I was interested and to send me her address.

As I was walking to her place (20minutes walk from where I was) I was one nervous as fuck, two excited as fuck I even had a boner just thinking of her and three I was cautiously walking and looking around in-case of any shady type of person to show up.

I finally get to her place it was a fine walk no shady person or anything and the building was also nice I would say it costed close to minimum wage to pay rent for sure so I message her and she gives me the apartment number I take the elevator and here I'm in front of her door the anxiety and nervousness are killing me and then she shows up and opens the door as most of you already probably guessed she was NOT the girl in the photos, she was not even Asian my boner instantly shrink.

She was what we like to call around here the ""default white blonde girl"" in my virgin meter she would be a 7/10 at best and this is where I should have ran but I thought ""I walked all the way to here and I finally got the balls to do it so fucked it"".

A bit of small talk about where I live and what I was doing in São Paulo and we're both naked she used her hands for a bit and it didn't took much for me to get hard she put a condom on me and then she sits on me and boom! I'm not a virgin anymore yay, right? No I actually didn't felt anything at all I only felt her weight against me and that's it and after riding me for like 30 seconds maybe one minute I and probably her as well felt the condom slipping to the tip of my dick I did not cum I was just not hard anymore.

She does a handjob again gets me hard very quickly put on a new condom and tells me to go on top of her and 5 seconds into me embarrassing trying to have sex she finally asks ""Are you a virgin?"" which I say yes ""This explains a lot you don't know how to have sex at all"" she then tells me to lie in the bed and masturbate so I can cum on her boobs I tried that but I couldn't cum at all by now I have no idea how long we're trying this so I ask her to do me a blowjob/handjob and after god knows how long I was getting close to it and then I had a cramp in my left leg I told her about it and said I needed to get up she says we should end this and ask me if I wanted to take a shower which I accept, after the shower she was already in her clothes so I just put mines one and leave but before leaving she tells me that I should get a girlfriend so she can teach me these kind of stuff (well if I had one I would not be here in the first place so I didn't answer her at all) and that's it.

The sex itself was AWFUL I know at least half of it was my fault but having someone say I was just bad at it didn't helped at all the blowjob was nice tho and her handjob was better than me masturbating even that I didn't came and no I did not ask for my money back I just left feeling nothing at all I'm not even mad that I lost 250BLR.

TL;DR Paid a hooker to take my virginity and I didn't even came losing 250BRL (50 dollars) the sex was awful and I didn't felt anything.  


Edit   
You guys didn't get me at all I never said I was looking for a perfect ""10/10"" girl to lose my virginity with I was looking for some I loved to do that but yes I was looking for that in a hooker because I was paying for it.

I ended it cause we were looking for different things and it just wasn't working out, so it ended no hard feelings. Now a few weeks back my best friend (who just got out a very toxic relationship and we will call her rose) who I have know for several years now asked what my thoughts were on her hooking up with the same guy I used to hook up with. Some quick back story about 2.5 years ago I lost a friendship due to a similar scenario where a then-close friend starting dating another ex of mine. The situation got a little too much for me and I had to step back but my friendship with the girl was never the same. So back to the current situation, after grace asked me about potentially hooking up with this guy, I basically told her that A) she's fresh out a relationship this would not be much of a good idea, B) she could do way better C) I do not want to complicate our friendship and this could create a weird dynamic since we tell each other everything. With her past relationship, it was very toxic and there many times where she used me to support her own relationship. Now that the relationship is over, she apologized for everything and we had been working on our friendship. She agreed with what I had to say about her question and was like I wont do it then. In the back of my head I realized that either way she was probably going to get with this guy. Weeks pass and she tells me that ""Your gonna hate me for this...I hooked up with someone you said not to"". I was pretty crushed because this is the second time she's chosen a guy over me. The convo got cut short cause we had to part ways but I was kinda like damn okay. I was quite angry because this makes things very complicated and as I know it her decision to be with whoever she wants to be with, I do not know if I can go through more drama with her. We did not talk for a week until she texted me asking how I was doing and to see how I was feeling about it. Is it too harsh to say that I need to step away from being friends with her because I value my friendship with grace and don't want to lose her? Ultimately I am pretty stumped and really don't know what to do.

I have been dating this girl for awhile now (April will be a year), and I love and care for her deeply. But I've recently realized that I just don't love her in a romantic way, and have no physical or emotional attraction to her whatsoever. 

She has been repressed her whole childhood, and has the maturity level of a 13 year old. She doesn't understand a lot, has major anxiety issues (can't do ANYTHING on her own), and can't properly care for herself due to her anxiety. She works maybe 10 hours a week, but has no interest of getting a new job due to fear of not knowing any coworkers. She wants to move in with her best friend, but can't drive, doesn't have any money saved up, no plans, etc. 

But the biggest reason I want to leave her is because I am terrified of having sex with. I am not a virgin, but I'm a very shy person, and I have a very hard time relaxing and becoming comfortable around people. It wasn't bad starting off, I just had no interest in taking it past the making out stage. I had a sit down talk with her about this, the boundaries I didn't want to be be crossed, and after everything I said, I don't think she even registered any of it. 

Now, every time she stays over, she constantly brings up sex, and keeps asking when I'll be ready. It's not her fault for wanting more from the relationship, but the pressure from her has made my no-sex boundaries turn into wanting nothing to do with her physically. No kissing, no cuddling, no anything. Even her hugging me sends me into a panic like state and I'll have to leave for a bit. 

She lives in an emotionally abusive household, and I've been trying to help her move out before I break up with her, but I hate keeping the relationship going. I've known from a few months in that we weren't compatible, but I feel a deep obligation to make sure she is protected and safe. I'm trying my hardest to help her, but I feel like she almost doesn't want to get out of her awful situation, and I'm almost at my breaking point. 

Should I wait until she moves out to break up, or rip off the band aid to not drag it out any longer? How can I let her down gently without hurting her to bad?

My GF went back to China back in September of 2020 to support her granddad due to a oporation he was going to have, but a few weeks before she went, she had a big episode of violance due to a NHS call center not helping her out in explaining her condition to her pearents.

How she got depression was, now looking back with her blaming me for advising her not to go back in March and being alone within her Uni Halls. Along with that i am accused of not respecting her and bullying her for not seeing things her way. 

I do beleive that i have been proper to her, giving all the respect i can in person, but due to us talking the last few months by text only and for limited amounts of time, it has gone down the drain and in last week a barrage of attacks via text of things i thought were good ideas but now aren't in her mind, which shes slamming me for. I prob shouldn't say this but she is still a Virgin, so one of the things i promised was not to do anything sexual with her without her explited permission first. We still havent done our first time,  but i have always respected her so i never push it. But becuase i said i had a dream about us in the future with kids, she thinks i want her to get pregnat which has also driven her to beleive i wont have a Ligature.. which is incorrect but im sure the depression is infulancing her thinking. 

&amp;#x200B;

The main crux of it all is a slight language barrier but her beleaving that my thoughts aren't taking her experiance or view into consideration and think i force my view onto her.

So, reddit, how can i make this better? is there something i can learn to support myself? I will freely admit i've been in and out of school at a younger age for ops on my ear, and bullied with no freinds between Age 7 and 18 due to people thinking i was some sort of pedo, so i don't beleive i have the social skills needed.

&amp;#x200B;

So I've been dating my GF for about a month now and last night we decided to go all the way for the first time. I was excited yet nervous, this was going to be my first time. She's had sex once so isn't exactly an expert either. Now I should point out that before, around her, I haven't had any problems getting, uh, my little guy going. Even little things like holding her hand, flirting, stuff like that, all gets me going.

&amp;#x200B;

But the moment she and I started getting going I couldn't if you will. She took her top off and I saw her breasts for the first time, I started kissing them and even that couldn't do anything for me. I told her maybe some more foreplay would help or if she told me how handsome I was that would help. She called me handsome and we flirted a bit more and that actually helped, but not for long. I eventually told her that I couldn't tonight, she was very understanding because she's awesome but I did reassure her that it was all on my end.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that I'm still new to this but I've been tossing and turning all night about it. Like, am I not into girls? I knew going into this relationship, through just exploring on my own, that I'm not 100% straight. I wouldn't say I'm into guys either, more feminine guys and trans girls are usually what I go after if I'm messing with myself I guess. I've always been romantically attracted to girls. But maybe I'm not into cis girls sexually? But then again, if I wasn't, why would I be able to involuntarily get erections when we're not even doing anything sexual? This whole thing has got me confused and some guidance on how to get things going between us would be awesome.

I am a Highly Sensitive Person, and an introvert, so we both knew this was a risky move, but because of the lockdowns in UK, we probably wouldn't get to see each other, so decided to go for it.

Over time, it's clear that I don't want to live with these kids anymore. They're rude, demanding, entitled, and seem to enjoy noisy electronics all the time. I get it, we're all suffering with these Covid-19 lockdowns, and now that they aren't going to school (and probably won't be until April) and we're all told to stay at home, I'm seriously considering my alternatives. He doesn't quite understand how this chaos is affecting my moods and concentration. (Thankfully we both have separate small rooms to work in, but mine is under a teens bedroom while his is not).

Add to that, our sex life has never been great, and is actually getting worse. He's a great guy, but I am not attracted to him as much as I should be. We don't get a lot of child-free days/evenings, so we are both drained by the time we do get alone time. And he seems to be psyching himself out in bed, and can't keep it up for very long. We have tried Viagara and it usually works, but planning ahead kills the mood. On top of that, one of his parents has a terminal disease, so he's assisting them too.

My feelings towards him are love but more in a close friend way now. I dread what kind of future we'd have while the kids are still living at home. I don't have kids of my own (was always on the fence) and now it's too late 

What would you do? My choices right now seem to be 1) stay, try to get along, and support him while he deals with parental health issues or 2) Tell him exactly what I'm feeling and see if we come up with a resolution together (me moving out or staying to support him for a predetermined length of time).",0,0,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,nsfw,Moved in with boyfriend and it's not going well because of his kids.

I (25F) had a fwb (26M) a couple or so years back and things were genuinely pretty good, often the best sex of my life, but now thinking back I've started to feel uncomfortable about some of the events.

The first one comes from fairly early on in the 1.5yr on/off arrangement. We'd had sex about 6/7 times during the evening/night. In the morning I was pretty sore and when he wanted another round I said no because I was so sore. Before I started getting ready to go he rolled me on top of him, arms around me for a goodbye cuddle. I then felt him suddenly enter me and start pounding away. I ended up enjoying the sex so kinda didn't think too much about it, though I was kinda confused and felt bad but wasn't really sure why. I didn't say no after he entered me, and ended up enjoying it, but I'm still confused about it since technically I had said no at least twice prior to this. 

When our arrangement came to its first end it was a really weird night. We had amazing sex, acknowledged by both as best so far. He was much more cuddly than usual for the most part. However, I went to the loo and came back and he wouldn't let me sleep in the bed. Said he wanted the room and I should sleep on the floor tossing me a pillow. I thought he was playing or trying to Dom me (He knows I'm a sub) so I played along and then tried getting in but he kept kicking away (didn't make contact). In the end he said if I gave him head I could get in, so I did (At the time reasoned because I enjoy it and I thought he was trying to Dom me. Knowing more now, I recognise that if he was trying to do that, we should have had a discussion prior). The next morning he told me it was the last time and basically booted me out. 

The final time that bothers me involves a threesome. He happened to be living with another friend (24F) from uni at the time, it's how we met. This was months after things had ended and I was visiting my friend (He was at work). My friend and I got very drunk. He came home near when things were winding down. I went to the loo and he ended up following me in and told me to get my knees. I did so and ended up giving him head. He told me to get up and see if my friend was interested in a threesome, something we'd discussed when together (and sober). I asked, she was, we ended up having sex. I don't remember half of it, or going to bed and I know she has black spots too as we were very drunk. He was completely sober. I know if I was sober, I wouldn't have considered sleeping with him again and would never have slept with my friend (Don't shit where you eat). I think this instance bothered me the most, I ended up crying quite a bit once home and feeling pretty shitty the week after.

Sorry for the long post, it's just started to bother me again and I don't really know whether any of this is assault, or if I maybe led him on and should avoid doing certain things again.

Feels like the perfect opportunity to type it out so I might at one point have a good laugh about this.

So 2 weeks ago I matched a girl on Tinder and we hit it off quite instantly, I asked to meet up and she agreed happily. We went for a long walk in the park with her dogs to get a chance to have a proper talk before going back to her place to have a couple drinks. 

Things went swimmingly! I really like this girl! Managed a walk of 2 hours without any awkward silences or me saying stupid things so we went to her appartment to drinks some wine and warm up. Halfway through the second bottle of excellent red wine things get kinda hot and heavy and we take it to the bedroom.

All was good and fun until at some point I start feeling... not so well. I remember in this moment that there's a reason I never drink red wine, my stomach does not agree AT ALL with red wine. I need to throw up, like NOW! I throw her off me and run to the bathroom and start hauling up all the wine. She comes to check on my and I am buttnaked hugging her toilet, trying to tell her how sorry I am in between the waves of liquid I am spewing out.

She was very understanding, brought me some water and told me I could make it up to her in the morning. Morning come and I have spent half the night hugging the toilet but fuck it this girl is beautiful and fun so I man up and get back to bed with her. NOW MY FUCKING DICK WON'T GET HARD! I am just exhausted and embarrased and then little me decides to just totally give up and ruin any chance I had of turning things around.

I just get out of the bed, take my clothes and want to go home. Her dogs used my clothes as a fucking pillow after running around in the mud so my jeans and jacket are dirty af. Fuck it, put em on, walk through the city to a bus stop to get back home, puke another 2 times on the way there, looking like a fucking hobo and people asking me if I'm doing alright.

I today learned the meaning of the walk of shame, and I'm gonna take a wild guess and say she doesn't exactly want to see me anymore either... 

Fml

TL ; DR: went on a date, drank red wine, my stomach does not agree with red wine, spent the night hugging her toilet and making a fool out of myself. Will not be going on a second date to say the least...


EDIT: I just woke up and this post got a lot more attention than I had anticipated. I didn't expect all the relationship advice to say the least, I just expected some good laughs. Anyway I did end up texting her in the evening apologizing and reassuring her that I was the problem and definitely not her. She agreed to meet up some other time (without the red wine).

Now, rewind maybe 5 years ago. I get asked by some friends to go out to a small mom and pop Indian restaurant to celebrate a friends birthday. I am stoked because the place has amazing food. It didn't even enter my mind that my stomach hadn't been feeling well and that I hadn't pooped in at least 2 days. We sit down and I order a rather spicy vindaloo, my favorite thing from this restaurant. Everything is going great, good food, loud laughs and nice drinks...hooray right?

Wrong! That when my gut tells me that it is very much time, but being the shy pooper I am, I begin to fight its urges. After only 5 minutes or so the cramps returned with the power of five suns. I had to sit bolt upright to prevent the mud monster from breaching the gates. I am now sitting with the best posture ever and sweating like a crackhead in a chalk factory. Something my friends immediately notice and ask about. To which I reply that my food is spicier than normal, before excusing myself to the bathroom. There was just a single bathroom at this place and it was tiny, but I had no choice. As soon as I sat down the crapaconda came flying out of me at nearly mach one. Even with all my embarrassment, all I could feel at the moment was pure relief and pride that i was able to hold the monster in for as long as I did. I stood up and much to my horror it was no crapaconda but a fully grown shitmodo dragon. The whole bowl was full, and I mean full! I gave it a few flushes, to which it only rolled around a little. There was no plunger in sight, I was trapped and beginning to panic. It was at this point that the true fuck up happened. In a moment of shear panic and embarrassment I fled the bathroom.

I returned to the table and continue like nothing happened, even know I felt horrible. We were getting ready to leave, when I saw an older man out of the corner of my eye headed to the bathroom. He opened the door and stepped inside to be greeted by the largest butt burrito that has ever been.
""OH GOOD LORD"" He yelled loud enough for it to be heard by everyone in the small restaurant
All of my friends turned and looked at me, all I could manage to do is say:
""Well it was fine when I was in there""

TL:DR Ignored the fact I hadn't pooped in days, went out for Indian food with friends and clogged the bathroom with perhaps the largest poopopotamus ever laid.

Also English is not my first language.

Quick backstory: I (F23) stopped hormonal birth control a few months ago due to some minor health issues. The change of my hormonal equilibrium was pretty awful, but on a bright note, my libido increased - quite a lot. 

My bf (M24) is a bit overworked and tired so his libido is a bit lower than the usual. 
I try to not stress him about it even if it’s frustrating when one feels horny 24/7 and the other one would be ok with having sex once a week.

Well today I texted him during his lunch break that I really wished he was at home with me... 
Then I thought I could sound insensitive and trying to explain why I was suddenly almost sexting him I fucked up and I texted “You know, since I came off birth control I can tell if I’m on my fertile window based upon my mood, and I just checked, I’m ovulating, that’s why I’m feeling like this today, it’s like my body’s saying let’s have this kid!”

We are not even sure we want kids, and my text looked like I was thinking about it, so I fucked up harder and texted again “I’m not saying we should try to conceive I was just stating why I’m horny”

He replied “Noted on my agenda”


TLDR: tried to justify I was in the mood for sex by saying I was ovulating to my bf, when we are not even sure we wants kids, and killing the possible mood of the night


Edit: I appreciate that some of you want to help me and try to suggest things to balance my needs vs. his temporary lack of interest ... but I don’t need these suggestions.

So I decided to go to a friend's place to work, he was also working remotely.

He moved to his place last month. It's a really small appartment that consists of a living room, a bedroom and of course a bathroom and a kitchen. One important detail is that the bathroom is directly accessible from the living room.

I set a table up in the living room and he locked himself inside of his room. Everyone start working.

I had a really important meeting in at 11am and I really stressed out about it. So I lit a couple of cigarttes but I still felt uneasy. Therefore, I decided to jerk it off.. At the moment it seemed like a good idea to ease off any tension, so I opened a good amateur video on my phone and got inside the bathroom and started stroking it. All of sudden, I hear my friend's voice yelling my name! Then he litterally said ""I can see you!"". At first I thought he was just being silly, but then I turned around and to my surprise, I noticed then, *only fucking then*, that his bathroom's door had a fucking large door glass that was not very dim and I could actually see him in the living room standing.
Needless to say how embarrassed I was. I mean the guy was a really close friend but he wasn't the kind of guy that would take jerking off in his bathroom easily. It just felt so ackward and I really wished I can fucking go back in time. 
So I put the dick back in my pants and then started washing my hands while complaining about how the door is innaprioriate for a bathroom while waiting for his reaction. Contrary to what I expected, he actually pretented it never happened. He said he didn't know what I was doing exactly, but he saw that I was standing up. 
Everyone then resumed working and I felt even worse than before. I guess it wasnt that of a relief LOL.

Luckily, the meeting after went so smooth.

TL;DR
I went to my friend's new place. I got into the bathroom to jerk off not noticing that the door had glass that did not block vision.

For context, I (19F) often help out with tech at my dad's office. I spent a lot of my childhood there, so I've known all of the staff for years.

On one of the days I was helping out, I don't know what was happening but my ass was releasing torrents of toxic gas. Like, I could not stop farting and it smelled like disgusting diarrhea. My farts could have knocked out CITIES. 

Anyways, I kept going to the bathroom or outside to release the fumes. At one point though, I had to go print something, and the printer was in my dad's personal office, which he is never in since he likes to sit in the common space area of the building. Now, I go crazy and keep blowing ass, which of course made the room absolutely STINK. 

This is where the fuck up comes in. Unbeknownst to me, my dad needed to come into his office and show one of his colleagues something on his computer. They come in unannounced. I begin PANICKING. As soon as they came in, I just took all of the stuff I had printed and fleed. It was so disgusting in there that I didn't even wait to see their reactions. My face was so red - I didn't care that much about my dad's reaction but I was so scared that the colleague would say something, especially since I am not close with her but she knows my family well. There was no way for me to blame it on anyone else since they both knew I was the only person that went in there. 

About 5 minutes later, they both come out, and as the colleague walks out of the room, my dad said to me ""did you HAVE to fart in my office?"" so loud that I swear all the staff heard him. I simply wanted to be buried.

I can seriously not explain why, but after a year of being with my current boyfriend, for whatever reason... I wanna marry this man. So badly. Like... I have no goddamned idea what’s happening to me that I’m so infatuated with this thought.

My problem is:
1) we have had casual conversations about marriage being stupid and pointless (although I have told him that if I ever have kids, I would wanna be married to make their lives... simpler?)

2) he’s a goddamned angel of a human being and I’m going through some depression issues and I feel like no one would possibly be willing to marry me in the state I’m in 

3) I’m his first real girlfriend and I’m (this is completely unwarranted) scared that he might not wanna make a commitment like that yet.

This is so silly, I’m half drunk at 4 AM and this will probably glean me nothing. But I’ve been mulling it over for 3 hours and I just would really love to call this man my husband.

Now on to the story. Me and my boyfriend went to visit his parents for a few weeks. 
One lovely day I woke up, had breakfast and noticed that my stomach was feeling a bit weird. I thought nothing of it and told myself that it was probably just some gas. Me, my boyfriend and his mom were discussing what we should do that day and we decided to take our 4 month old puppy for a walk on the beach. 

We get to the beach and had a blast, our puppy was chasing waves and digging in the sand. We were there maybe 45 minutes when we started getting back and decided to go get some ice cream. I got in the car and immediately after sitting down my stomach gurgled in a menacing way and I realised that I needed to shit. Like right now. I told my boyfriend to drive straight home, he asked me if I could wait until we had gotten ice cream like we had discussed. I said absolutely not, I need to go. Right. Now. I was almost crying at this point and telling him (with his mom in the backseat holding our puppy listening to all this) that I think I have food poisoning and to DRIVE. Thankfully it wasn’t a long drive, but unfortunately it was long enough for me to shit my pants in the car, in front of my boyfriend and his mom. So we finally made it to the house. I wrapped a towel around me and ran into the bathroom where I spent the next 30 minutes in agony from the pain and the embarrassment. I finally managed to get myself together, cleaned up and went in our room. His mom came in to ask me how I was doing and asked if I wanted something to help soothe my stomach. I politely declined and we carried on with our holiday like nothing happened.

A little backstory first:

 So throughout the years my brother would text me (30m) pictures of himself shirtless or pantless (no nudity) as a joke to me to get me to say ""Haha fuck you""  or something like that. I would tell him to stop, but he always thought it was hilarious. So I gave him one final warning, but he sent another one. So last year, I came up with the idea of sending a fully erect picture of my dick to him after he sent another shirtless picture.

 He thought it was (obviously) disgusting and couldn't believe I would do that. The shirtless pictures stopped but I made it my mission to trick him into looking at random dick pics of mine. I would send family photos and there would be a random dick pic in there. I would text him these made up stories with pictures, get him invested in the story, and then randomly send a dick pic. Simple stuff like that. His reactions to these are absolutely hilarious to me (my wife thinks it is the weirdest thing ever, but she agreed to send him one of my dick pics to him after I die so I know she's on my side) 

Obviously, I have no clue if I am going to die before him, but I am making plans just in case. I've literally made it my mission to send him pictures of my dick until he takes his dying breath.

 So basically what I need are ideas on how I can trick him into looking at these dick pics after I die. At a certain point I know he will just stop accepting mail from me or my wife. I know he'll block my number if I send dick pics from future to him. I would like some help with ideas from the people on how I can set up things now so he will receive these until he dies.

We live in a very small apartment, so from my room I heard him complaining about the fact that I used canned pumpkin. This was upsetting to me because I went through the trouble of making the pie. He was making comments like ""He did this to spite me"" and ""I'll never grow a pumpkin again"". Later he said he liked the pie and went to bed, but I was still upset.  I was talking to my mom about this, and I started crying because I really wanted him to like my pie. My mom woke him up and told him to apologize, and it took a few minutes of explaining why I was upset before he did, even though I'm not sure it was sincere, since he still doesn't understand why I was so upset, and I can hear him arguing with my mom about it.

Then I figured ""oh you've been fasting all day maybe you're thirsty and hungry"" so I start slowly sipping down some water and eventually pull out my apples from my lunch kit. I thought I should eat something not too heavy (had mashed potatoes and salmon to eat later for dinner) to just see if it settled my stomach. Big. Oof. 5 minutes later I'm throwing my face mask on. I can feel it coming, the stomach did not agree with my executive decisions. Hands down a 0/10 rating. As I'm speed walking out of the room to the bathroom, it begins. I manage to make it out the door but its too late. I give props for my mask for being impermeable because the contents of my stomach stuck in there well. So well, in fact that I couldn't breathe and without thinking I take my mask off in a panic, causing everything to spill on the ground and then, I take 2 steps and another wave hits me. I finally made it to the bathroom but there was really no point now.... so I had to scrub that all out. Now there will be 2 huge stains in our hallway, right in front of my bosses office.

By contrast my sister got a fancy new bike.

I was excited so I let everyone try it because FuTuRe tech and stuff, but now my sister is realizing that she can use it to exercize. Thus far every day she's been asking to use it and draining the battery completely. I generally let her but tbh my patience has been starting to wear thin since it means I can't use it then or for the time it takes to charge it again. I mean I don't use it that often anyway but it's nice to at least have the choice if that makes sense.

Then today she asked if she can use it and I said I was already planning on using it (I really only used it for one song in Synth Riders after my mom spent a while trying it out.)

She seemed disappointed then said, *""Maybe we should create a schedule for when we can use it.""*

I don't know why I felt defensive when she said that but I just did. I kinda let out a frustrated grunt and she was like, *""Sorry, I didn't mean to impose myself onto your gift.""*

I feel bad though. I mean it is a good idea. if she wants to use the headset I can stand to give it to her 10-20% of the time while I get the reast. but then that would mean I have to let people leave it out where it can get damaged and I'm paranoid about that.

I'm probably going to figure something out anyway but was I being an asshole for feeling frustrated about this?

**EDIT: Thanks for the input. I talked with her and, since I'm almost never in a gaming mood in the morning, I told her she can use it then but I get it for the reast of the day. That's also good because I don't like feeling pressured to play asap because she's waiting for it after me or something.**

**Also just some clarification: My post isn't about wanting to only keep it for myself. I don't mind her using the headset sometimes. We're both old enough to respect the technology so I'm not scared of her specifically breaking it. I think my big issue is feeling like I can't enjoy the headset because she asks for it at inopportune times and I feel pressured (not necissarily from her) to let her use it.**",0,0,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,self,"AITA for being hesitant about aggreeing to a ""sharing schedule"" for VR headset I got?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/kpb3dz/aita_for_being_hesitant_about_aggreeing_to_a/,all_ads,39.0

I don't think I've done or said anything that would make them behave like this. 

There's been a big tension in the flat since the New Year, though, and I think it's down to the fact that a bunch of them had organised this dinner and ""actively excluded inviting certain people"" from attending - this is according to a flatmate who was invited to go to the dinner but then unceremoniously uninvited.

 Lots of people are completely ignoring her now which I find totally uncalled for because she spent hundreds for our Christmas meal. Apparently still not everyone have paid their share.

Basically half of the people here are toxic hypocrites. 

We used to have good nights together, laugh together, but now everyone sticks to their rooms, apart from a group of them who blare music out late at night, leave the sitting room a mess, and are just all round insufferable.  

I mean some girl posted on our chat ""Whomever broke my glass, I will kill your family and make you watch"" - and it turns out she broke it herself. ",0,0,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,self,Do people gets 'kicks' out of being so hypocritical and toxic?,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ktpuzs/do_people_gets_kicks_out_of_being_so_hypocritical/,all_ads,4.5

So my friend (M20) is a Germaphobe, and because Covid happened he has been very on edge ever since the pandemic hit our country. He also has a weakened immune system. Which is why i kinda feel like the Asshole here.

So me (M19) and my girlfriend (F19) were at my house having a good day and watching some movies. When my friend asked if he could come over. Which both me and my girlfriend have known him for years now. So we both didn’t mind. So he came over and right away I could tell something was wrong by the way he looked at us and he kinda just didn’t seem right. So i asked him but he said he was fine. So we just went back to the movie. At the end of the movie we just sorta chilled for like an hour or so. Then my girlfriend needed to leave so i got up and walked her to the door and Gave her a hug. 

And right after the hug my friend just started screaming at us. And started to cuss both of us out. And after he was done he started to cuss her out and say stuff like “Do you even fucking give a shit about anyone besides yourself?!” and stuff like that. And by that point it had been a good minute or two so i was sick of it at this point. So I told him to get the fuck out of my house. He looked stunned at what I said. Then he started to accusing me of being a shitty friend for comprising his health for my girlfriend. So i told him again to get the fuck out of my house. And so he did. I waited for like 5-10 minutes for him to leave and walked my girlfriend to her car. 

A couple of hours later he called me and I ignored his call. But he wouldn’t stop calling me so I just turned my phone on silent. And after a while I looked at my phone and saw i had gotten a bunch of messages from him and mutual friend calling me an asshole and saying i’m a horrible fucking friend for risking my friends health for my girlfriend. 

I just don’t see how I’m the asshole. Because he wanted to come over to my house and he knew that my girlfriend was over as well.

*Apologies I'm talking about once every 2 weeks not the video game 😂*

I've been seeing someone since September and I think because of lockdowns, the relationship has moved pretty quickly and we spend an awful lot of time together 

I said from the very beginning I hate shouting, I used to get shouted at a lot in past relationship. He was very understanding at the beginning and really apologetic if he snapped. However now, in the past couple months he's been blowing up at me roughly once a fortnite. It normally happens in the car and I can feel the tension in the air like a sniffer dog. It's like he decides that no matter what I say, I'm in the wrong and today when I asked him to stop shouting it got really ugly. He screamed me he'll shout at me if he wants, called me the c word, telling me he hates me. When I tried to get out the car he started moving the car so I couldn't. 

After this I was expecting a huge apology when we finally got home, instead he started to list little selfish things I've done all morning. Eg, turned off the radiator when I got hot without asking him, decided we should go for a dog walk too early in the morning. He even brought up the fact he went down on me this morning and I came but then we didn't do anything else, making me selfish. 

I really love him and I can tell he's got anger issues - something that he acknowledges when he's thinking straight and tells me he's working on. My question I suppose is, do I stick it out because I love him and he's looking to help himself? Or is this behavior too worrying to overlook?

I mostly moved out due to how strict my parents were. When i say strict, i don’t mean something like home by 10pm. I mean, I wasn’t allowed to have friends older than me (even by a few months) i wasn’t allowed any guy friends. If i had a project to work on at school and got partnered with a guy, my mom would tell my teachers to make me do it alone. I was only allowed on my phone if someone (mom or dad) was there to monitor what i was doing. Weekdays my bedtime was 9pm and weekends 9:30pm. I could only have sleepovers if it was at my house and all of my friends have to be questioned to make sure they were “clean” meaning, they didn’t have boyfriends, no tattoos, went to church, you get it. 

So you can imagine, i had literally 1 or 2 friends. By 18, i didn’t have any plans, i just packed my stuff and left. My parents weren’t happy and tried for months to get me to come home but i didn’t plan on it. Anyways, i landed a damn good job and was able to get my first apartment shortly after. My friend is over at my house almost everyday with her boyfriend and we just hang out. 

I didnt cut out all contact with my parents but i limit it to only only special occasions. My mom wanted to have a zoom family call whatever it’s called and asked me to join. I figured what the hell i’ll join and say hi. As i’m talking to my little cousin, in the background you could see my friend’s boyfriend come into the living room area. Everyone’s face kinda froze and i didn’t think much of it. 

My mom asked who it was and i told her and she immediately gets annoyed? She started asking why he was leaving my bedroom, which he didn’t. The bathroom is the same way towards the bedroom so i could see why it would look like he left from my room. She and my dad proceeds to ask me why i have guys at my home, why is he 21 hanging around me (i just turned 20 but yea) it was like i was 15 again

My mom then insists i have him leave. At this point my friend and her boyfriend hears this and goes like wtf? I didn’t know what else to do but laugh. I said “are you out of your mind” and laughed some more. I realized they were serious and said my goodbyes and hung up. Later i started getting messages that my parents are upset i laughed at them and my family says it’s in my best interest to apologize because i was being an asshole for laughing. AITA for laughing?

~~~
Edit- I did not expect to have this much feedback! Thank you everyone who took time to comment and a big thank you for the awards! 

For those of you asking why i would think i was the asshole, it’s mostly cause i laughed at them then hung up so i thought it was rude and asshole-ish especially after being told i was by my aunt as well.

I seen a lot of people telling me to go no contact. I’d feel terrible if i did such a thing but someone did point out they’ll never change their ways so i think i might have to. you know, i’ve got no idea how to set boundaries but i’m sure there’s a few articles that can help me with that. I did block them from all of my social media accounts except facebook so i think that counts? I’m not familiar with setting boundaries sorry

I found out from my little cousin that my mom has been asking where i live so now i’m kind of scared for that. Though not many know my address, if she ask the right people she might find out i hope not.",0,0,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,self,AITA for laughing at my mom after she and my dad insisted i tell my friend’s boyfriend to leave my house?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/l3d4ja/aita_for_laughing_at_my_mom_after_she_and_my_dad/,all_ads,12007.0

He asks me to do oral sex pretty often but he refuses to return the favour, stating that he’s never done that his life.  He told me most of his exes were virgins, and often complains that women are worse off with experience, and he wish he could have met me when I was younger so he could shape me.


Then I figured that there’s sth deeper than sex.

He’s proud that his family (aunts and uncles included) all gave birth to boys (there are like 10 men). I was surprised and told him my family have more baby girls than boys, in fact most of the younger gen are girls. He laughed at me and commented that women in my family are “incapable of having boys”.


He’s not rich, but he wants 4-5 boys in the future. “You’d spend 10 years or so just giving birth!” He smiled.

This is horrifying to me- he wants no girls, but there’s a 50% chance! he didn’t even ask me what’s my plan. Knowing how hard motherhood is, I absolutely do not wanna spend the next 10 yrs sacrificing most of my time with pregnancy. I have no intention to be a housewife. If I do have kids, I only want 1-2 so that we can raise them with resources we have instead of splitting it up. Education is expensive!

He’s a victim of poor family having multiple kids: he could have gone to better school and college but he couldn’t because his family couldn’t support him- they have the money but there are other kids. 


It seems to me that neither him or his family acknowledges the work women do, and firmly believe women enjoy doing those things and “it’s just normal”. His sister in law, shortly after giving birth to their son- and she was so weak and was in so much pain- received no comfort. His brother was happy it was a boy and smiled:”one done, another one in two years!” His family doesn’t understand why the in-law’s mother was furious, he even wondered “shouldn’t she be showering in happiness and joy? Motherhood is the happiest thing ever!”


He snores, and he snores LOUD. So loud that it was extremely hard for me to sleep at all. I talked to him that it would be better- if we ever move in together- for us to sleep in separate bedrooms. He lashed out! He yelled at me that sleeping in different bedrooms is the same as separation, and his mother never had the thought of not sleeping with his father in the same bed no matter how loud he snored.

Lately I've felt this deep, all encompassing feeling of boredom. Like I was born into this world just to stare at a wall until I die. It sucks.

I love fiction. I play video games, I read books I watch TV and movies. Fiction can be incredibly moving and important. I love getting to know a character and following them through a journey. But it also makes me feel envious sometimes. That I'll never be like the characters in the stories I read. I'll just be some chick, one speck in the universe, doing nothing of importance until the day I inevitably die.

Not to be too much of a bummer, but I never really asked to be brought into existence. I love my parents and I'm grateful to them. They raised me well, and I appreciate all they've done. I don't blame them for anything. But at the same time, I was born into a world that's boring and depressing and fucked up.

Does anyone here kinda feel like... Like life is tiring, but you've got a crippling fear of death? You're not fond of existing but non existence is petrifying? That's kinda where I'm at. And it's so tedious.

My college has it set up so that I don't have to go home, which is nice cause my house is 4 hours away from my school, and I filled up my being home meter over the holidays. My problem doesn't have to do with the actual facilities or quarantine process. I can stand being on my own in a hotel room for days on end as long as the food is decent. What is really getting to me is the stress from falling behind in classes. One class in particular is a studio class with a ton of field work. This entire class is based entirely on mini-fieldtrips. I literally cannot do any work while I am holed up here, and while I've been stuck in this place, everyone else has been working on our first big project which is due on Feb 1. We have 3 class period per week, and altogether, the periods add up to 8 hours per week. I have missed 4 classes which means I have missed a total of 32 hours of class time.

While all my other classmates are out and about, taking pictures, sketching sites, and getting feedback and direction from the professor, I'm in here trying to pretend that it doesn't tear me up to be falling so behind. I emailed the professor a few days ago, asking if there is *anything* I can do, and he hasn't gotten back to me.

I try to reframe it. Better now at the beginning of the semester than in the middle. This professor seems like a pretty decent guy, so I know he'll work with me, and this shouldn't cost me a grade. I'm okay, and everything is going to be okay. This sucks, but I know I will be able to catch up and bounce back, I'll just have to work really hard.

I find the newest seasons still decent in terms of humor, sometimes downright hilarious as I always knew it to be. The main objection I hear is that it is not emotional and characterizes some characters badly. To this all I can say is ""dude it is a comedy not a drama!"" I know that the past seasons had episodes devoted to wholesome and sad moments, but they were never the sole purpose of the show. This is why I am boggled about people getting upset over how a character acts in one episode or another, this just seems so odd a complaint to me, as not only are characters not really meant to have a whole continuous behavior, but the whole floating timeline of the series makes all background exposition essentially humorous filler, like Mr. Burns has had like, what, 17 backstories that do not correlate?

Our friendship was made due to our mothers been friends. His mother would have been in her mid forties,  divorced fairly attractive nothing special but 'hot for a mother' would have been the view at the time.

I often went over to one friends house for video games, hang outs and sleep overs. He had a very big house , 3 different levels,  lots of rooms and probally 3 or 4 washrooms. He had a big back yard that led onto farmers fields so we often went mountain biking back there. One time we it was wet and muddy which meant great fun. I was there for afternoon this occasion and been a teenager gave me thought to not having a change while getting caked in mud! 
Well as we come up the back of his house wheeling our bikes only our eyes probably not having mud. His mother runs to the back door and tells us to stop in the porch / walk in area understandable not drag disgusting mud into the house. She promptly tells us to strip down, me and friend look at each other and giggle. Quite innocently she says not worry shes seen it all before and just down to our boxers. My friend who was often a bit of a comedian goes fully naked covers his privates and runs in the house his mother laughs and jovially tells him to go right into the shower near his room on the top level. 
Nervously now just the two of us me and my friends mother she tells me to go in the downstairs washroom. Strangely this washroom never had a lock and previous times at his house I would go up stairs to another washroom and avoid that one. This was a large washroom with a shower bath tub combo. I go in there start the shower and as I  take off my extremely dirty boxers I actually look around for a good place to set them. Just them she walks into the bathroom doing that gentle knock thing you do looking away and says she is here to take my boxers to add to the laundry and give me some of my friends clean clothes to change into. I am shocked and embarrassed and just freeze covering my privates. She gets closer to the point where she is taking the boxers which are down by my hip. Playfully she pulls down her loose fitting t shirt and flashes me her chest , boobs in bra, and says 'I ve shown you mine....show me yours. "" Still in legit shock of what's happening and she takes the boxers away from my hip and gentle pushes my hands away from covering my cock and balls. At this point I am 15 back then if the wind change direction i got an erection now I have just seen boobs in a bra so was hard as a rock.
She starts to jerk me off, not saying anything and just looking at my dick. I just look off into space not knowing what to say or do. It felt like a long but realistic it would have been about 3 to 5 minutes and I ejaculated,  all over the tiled floor. Embarrassed I apologize!!!!!! Quicky grab toilet paper and wipe it up she giggles and walks out. Pooof like it never happened. I shower physically there but mentally just gone.
I get out of the shower my friend is sat at the kitchen table with his mum making us a snack. I eat it quietly and there is some simply table talk from his mum. Again I am not really focused on what is been said. I tell my friend I have to go and he says what about your clothes. His mum says not to worry they can drop them off another time. 
Now! I have never told my friend, who I actually lost contact with when we went to university/ college. Never talked to his mum about it. Never mentioned it to my parents and never to any people I have been in a relationship with. At the time this was only my second sexual encounter. I had kissed and made out before and honestly had one in the pants hand job from a girl the same age. Looking back every now and then I go from a very immature attitude of 'got a handjob from an older woman that's awesome ' to I just wanna scream and yell at her ' like wtf were you doing?' Blaming my self cuz I never said hey, no, stop or any indication to get out. Again I had a boner and had no problems cuming but again back to she should have known. So yeah sorry this is long and probally boring and not many people care to finished the read but to this day 20 odd years later that was one of my first sexual experiences which sometimes I even think about and get turned on even now. To other times I get very angry.

I didn't consider my partners food likes when buying food for our trip and told her she was having a tantrum when she lost it at me. AITA?


I went camping this weekend with my partner.  Since my partner was working part of the weekend I drove out and met our friends, set up and did all the shopping for the trip. Usually when we go camping my partner organises the food and it's usually pretty labour intensive. 

It was all pretty simple fare. I was pushed for time and forgot condiments so no dip or mayo and I didn't get sauces and things just meat veg rice eggs and noodles and snacks


My partner is a chef and a bit of a food snob. I drove a 3 hour round trip to pick her up and take her out. Day 2 the fire brigade came said  no  camp stoves were allowed due to fire danger (I'm in Aus). I'd had several drinks and couldn't drive, my partner doesn't have a licence. So options were rolls, salad and fritters, or wraps. Not much I could do otherwise. 

My partner at this point started making snarky comments that I hadn't thought to buy ANY of the food she likes and there was nothing nice. She actually yelled that I hadn't brought dressing for the salad. Granted in my shopping I was thinking about easy and didn't take the time to make sure her favourites were there.

She wanted to drive into town and I didn't want to drive when I might Be over. I refused to use a stove in fire ban. The fines are enormous AND I 've lived in bushfire areas so I know how important it is to be careful.

she got more and more angry and upset saying she had eaten nothing at all and was starving and I didn't care. I said there was food even if it wasn't her favourite, she was choosing not to eat and I was over her having an adult tantrum and went to hang with  my friends. She sat in the car crying for hours.

I want very sensitive about it and told her she was being ridiculous. I kept offering her food options. Wraps were 'too dry' she didn't like rolls. Couldn't possibly eat salad and veggie fritters because there was no dressing and that was food I liked.

I stopped drinking and said I thought I'd be ok to drive in and pick up dinner at which point she kept saying 'don't worry about me, worry about yourself, I'm not hungry anyway I'm FINE.  So i told her ok, but I'm not going to sit here getting sucked into her b.s.. She went to bed and I stayed with my friends. Slept beside her later because no other option. 

Woke in the morning and she threatens to hitchhike into town if I didn't pack down and leave immediately. I said I'll drive you if you to town of you want to catch a train back or she could wait. I ended up leaving hours before I planned to. I also said somewhere in all of this that is never seen an adult have such a ridiculous tantrum because they didn't have the food they wanted. she told me to fuck off and I said you need freaking therapy. Not nice but hey

Now I'm kicked to the couch and she is refusing to speak to me.

He has a drinking problem. I don’t know if I just can’t admit it yet , but I don’t want to say alcoholic, though it runs in his family. I’ve spoken to him calmly quite a few times about how I feel his drinking is becoming a problem. He cut back for a bit and now things are amping up yet again. The pandemic has had little impact on our lives and we are very lucky, so that isn’t why things are amping up in my opinion. Maybe perhaps because drinking has been more normalized during this time? Anyway...
Today I fucking lost it on him and I’m embarrassed. I doubt he’ll remember because he is out of his mind drunk right now. Here is what set me off ...
He had a work meeting today. At a brewery. When he was telling me this last week, all I could think about was how is he going to be able to handle this? Will he be able to sip a beer and conduct himself professionally, or will it go south? 
Well, the meeting was at 2. I don’t text or call him because he’s an adult and shouldn’t need a babysitter and I’m busy with my job, taking care of our daughter and my dog. 9:30 rolls around and I hear the car pull into the driveway. I call him and he ignores. I call again...ignore. By this time I’m hot. I go out to the car and I see he’s passed out. I fly into a fucking rage. I open the car door and he nearly falls out. I’m scream whispering so I don’t wake up the neighborhood.  

Not sure exactly what came out of my mouth ... maybe something along the lines of I hope you puke and shit yourself tonight you trash bag. I am still pissed ...a fucking 7 hr hangout at a bar in a pandemic - drunk driving - just poor decisions made. Not even sure how a bartender let him drive home in that condition. I’m not even sure he was at the bar that long- maybe he was at his Co worker’s house. I have not a clue.

Not even sure what I’m asking for here. I just wanted to vent. I’m still pissed and disgusted.

Our marriage/relationship is for the most part completely healthy. We always hang out together with friends that we share. We are also very trusting and can spend a weekend apart. This usually happens when I want to go do something active (mountain biking, skiing,  etc).

But lately, I have been getting sad about the fact that I feel like she doesn't know some of my friends (high school friend and his girlfriend) because she doesn't enjoy the same activities. 

Don't get me wrong, I understand those things just aren't for some people. And I know she feels self conscious about not being good at those things.  We've had conversations about it. 

At the same time, I don't really care if she has the same interests and I don't think it should get in the way of us going on trips together. If she wants to go shopping while I go biking that is fine with me.

Here comes the problem: I think I am developing feelings for her.

my situation is that, well she is my roommate. i see her literally everyday,  especially now with the covid lockdown we spend 90% of our days at home. its not the rejection i am fearing, but rather the awkwardness that could potentially follow if i spill the beans to her. its not like i can ask a her out, get possibly rejected, and go home and forget all about it. i live with this woman, so the thought will  always be lingering around.

i would like to add that she has not given me any signs that she is interested in me before- not  any that i noticed at least. our conversations are strictly platonic, and she always tries to involve our 3rd roommate to any of our activities that we plan out. i asked my friend about it and he told me you will never know unless you communicate with her and let her know the situation straight up.

i just dont want to make things awkward in the household, if in fact she does not have any mutual feelings towards me the same way i do for her. what should i do? i would appreciate any advice.

\-edit: thanks for the advice guys. i had a gut feeling that if i did express my feelings for her, everything will go wrong. the responses i got from this post solidified my final decision of just suppressing my feelings for the greater good of the household relationship. i shall accept the situation, and move on with my life. thanks again",0,0,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,self,I(25M) might be catching feelings for roommate(28F). should i let her know?,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/kzirev/i25m_might_be_catching_feelings_for_roommate28f/,all_ads,8.0

We met on Hinge when I changed my location to LA as I'm applying to grad school there and wanted to check out the potential. I met my boyfriend, and we talked for the whole month of October over text and Facetime. At the end of October, he offered to pay for my flight to LA if I would come and stay with him. I agreed and ended up staying and am still down here with him, meaning that we have spent 2.5 months living together. Within these 2.5 months, we went to Mexico, where he asked me to be his girlfriend about 2.5 weeks into my stay with him.

Everything was going great, although we occasionally had some issues with his lack of communication and conversation ability, which he admitted to being a part of his undiagnosed autism. After about a month with him, he started to be quite rude and secretive, which I found quite unusual and a tad harsh. I mentioned this to him and asked if he was still talking to others even though we were officially dating. He said no and would get quite angry when I brought this up. I started to see a girl's name coming up frequently on his phone, but he has lots of friends that are girls, so I assumed it was another girl like that. However, I saw a message on the screen that seemed too inappropriate for a friend, which made me curious if he was lying to me that they were just friends. I decided to leave it and trust that my boyfriend wasn't doing anything terrible.

I went home for Christmas with him and met his entire family. During Christmas, he was a jerk to me, and it pissed me off, so I finally was able to get a hold of his phone and found messages with a substantial amount of different girls. Messages about hooking up, sexting, hanging out, just general complementing, and no mention of having a girlfriend (all these messages were very recent within one week of me seeing them). I called him out on it and said that he lied to me when he said he wasn't still talking to anyone and that he had broken my trust in the relationship. I asked him if I didn't come home with him for Christmas if he would have fucked one of these girls, and he said YES!, but he said he would have felt bad after (like wtf!).

I was really sad, but he said that it would never happen again and he would rebuild my trust. So I decided to give him another chance as I genuinely felt like this guy and I are meant to be, and our personalities and other aspects of our lives mesh so well together. A few days after New Years', he had left his computer open and I took a little peek at his Imessages on his laptop to find that he had messaged a girl only five days after I had confronted him the first time. He was talking to this girl about them hanging out and doing inappropriate things. Not only did this mean that he had broken my trust and lied to me again, but that he was also deleting messages off his phone. The reason I know he was deleting messages is because he had shown me his phone earlier that day to prove he hadn't messaged anyone since the last incident, and these messages were not there. I called him out again, and he said he was sorry and didn't realize how much his actions had hurt me. 

I am currently staying with him still, but I don't know what to do anymore. He promised me it would never happen again and that we are meant to be together forever. However, I worry that he will cheat on me in the future as he hasn't proven to be very trustworthy.

I’ve always had problems making/keeping friends. My entire life I’ve always messed up my relationships. Whether it’s because I got overly jealous of friends making other friends, tired of always hanging out with people, or just had a bad day and snapped - I’ve burnt down or tried to burn down every single relationship I’ve been a part of.

It’s been years since the last time I did that and I thought I was better. I’ve been in therapy for a year now. I have/had a group of friends that I genuinely like being around. I hadn’t snapped in over 3 years. A couple days ago I snapped again.

I guess this entire thing falls under one big axiom - that people only want me around when I have something that they want. I found my current friend group by renting out rooms in my house. The guys are great but - as most college student aged people are - they aren’t the most responsible. The amount of cleaning up I have to do, rent forgiveness, lending rides or food, etc is unbelievable. And before people say “it might help if you find friends your age” I’m very very young for where I’m at in life - my roommates are acting their age - and in some ways I’m acting years above my own.

With all that going on - I finally cracked while playing games 2 nights ago. We were at probably my best friends apartment (he used to be a roommate with his fiancé but moved out after he got married), with his brother (who currently lives at the house) and the other people who live at the house. We got into an argument about the rules and for some reason I started yelling at them and then left (leaving my keys because I drove my car there and they didn’t). After that I sent a message apologizing for my actions and said that everyone at the house was given 60 days notice to get out (with plans to send out an official notice in the next few days).

In my head everyone was supposed to be pissed with me. Why the fuck would you want to hang out with me besides the fact that I give you a nice house to relax and do pretty much whatever? Especially since you know I’ll bail you out if you mess up? Take away that, the excessive spending on food and drinks and whatever and what do you have left? An anxious depressed workaholic with no personality. The weird part is - that’s not what’s happening.

I got a text from my friend and his wife telling me that they understand that I don’t want to be friends but they are going to wait patiently for me. I got a text from one of my roommates/tenants saying that he’s sorry if he fucked up and that he understands and is there for me. Every time I see any of them they just smile - maybe asking if I’m ok. Heck, one of them texted me to see if I wanted pizza.

I just don’t get it. All I can think about is that maybe they are just trying to get me to change my mind - or maybe they think they can screw me over in some other way. My friends that don’t live here are making me second guess everything though. Why should they care? What is in it for them? People have responded “well why are you friends with them” but I don’t know the answer to that either. If you are no longer providing value, why should they care?

I’ve been with my s/o for nearly 3 years. He owns a home in a mid city area. I rent in the downtown district. Until Covid (I work in hospitality, as does he, so we’ve been hit pretty hard financially) I was able to sustain independently. I never asked for anything. 

Then once I wasn’t able to maintain, I started asking for financial assistance. After all, we hadn’t been living in his home that he OWNS. While he has a roommate that takes care of the property, they still split the mortgage and utilities. 

Up until recently, as I said, I never asked for anything. Then...I had to. He acts as if it is the end-all-be-all that I would ask for money to keep the lights on when we haven’t even stayed at his home more than 5x in nearly 3 years. This is blamed on me, as his roommate is a very introverted quiet man. Which I respect, and I quite respect him. He loves the home, and he takes wonderful care of it. 

But I’m treated (by my s/o) as if it’s my responsibility that be decided to become a negligent homeowner. As if I’m being outlandish for asking for financial contribution towards the apartment we’ve been in for the last nearly 3 years. 

He recently “donated”—his words, not mine, nearly $600 to my Venmo but continued to bring it up in a negative light so I sent it right back. He doesn’t think he owes me anything because he “owns a home.” And I rent.

I’m male and she’s female.

I’ll start with her side; her mom is very hard on her. She constantly asks her questions like “are you sure you still need medication” or saying “just because you’re depressed doesn’t mean you need to be an asshole.” Now my girl friend isn’t completely mentally well so it’s obvious that these comments (and many more + actions) are having a bad effect on her, and her father just sort of stays on the sidelines and has no effect. My girlfriend also has some pretty gnarly adhd which her mom refuses to address and have the correct medication prescribed for her. On top of this, since we started dating, she has had some turmoil with her best friend and it’s starting to seem like they’re permanently drifting apart no matter how hard my girlfriend tries to get things back to how they were between them before. So, recently my girlfriend has been stressed, unhappy, and unwilling to face responsibilities due to a lack of motivation or will. Fortunately, she doesn’t suffer from anxiety, but I’d say she’s leaning into depression.

On my end, I’ve been depressed since about late October. It got bad in October and November, pretty much went away around December and early January when school ended and I started dating my girlfriend, and has come back in the past couple weeks. I haven’t turned in any assignments for a week, don’t enjoy going to the gym anymore which use to be one of my strongest passions, and my anxiety (which I have had for most of my life) has been off the walls. I take medication but the only one that really seems to do anything is the adderall for a short period after I take it. My therapy doesn’t seem to do much either and my mom is desperately trying to help me, which upsets me because I want her to be happy more than anything.

For both me and my girlfriend, everything has become dull. It’s not that we enjoy being with each other so much that it outshines everything else and makes other things seem dull. It’s that everything was already starting to go dull, but our relationship hasn’t because of how well we go together. We hangout with each other 12 hours a day at least every other day, and during those times, all our worries just melt away. We’re actually productive when we’re together. For example, today she came over early, I got some homework done, we skated around, got some exercise in, ran some errands for my parents, and did some other stuff.

But during the periods when we aren’t together, such as while I’m typing this, I feel like a shell. My life has become a cycle of hangout with her, simply survive at the bare minimum only thinking about the next time we’ll hangout, hangout with her and have the time of my life, and repeat. And neither of us have the social motivation to hangout with anyone other than eachother, as ridiculous as it sounds.

I really don’t know what to do. This girl genuinely makes me so happy. Her personality, her humor, her kindness, her ability to understand from different perspectives, her beauty, her intelligence, her smile, the way we just work together flawlessly. I feel like I’m in a dream the way I love this girl so much, but I’m really worried about the dependency, because I know how unhealthy it is.

I was 20, had been very popular in high school, my community and now early college, but paranoia from mixing adderall (for ADHD) and marijuana, being kicked out of university and a failed romantic relationship led me to sadness/paranoia/suspicion about everyone around me, and I felt the need to isolate from everyone, making the fatal decision of committing social suicide by deleting my medias.

I cannot retrieve them as they were hard-deleted (twitter, instagram, snapchat). It's been four years and I don't know how to return. I had a following of about 600 people on instagram alone that had grown organically over the years. How do I recover from this?

I've basically disappeared, doing my own thing, got fit, and am continuing my education while in therapy, but now that it's a pandemic I feel more isolated than ever without at least the superficial connections of social media. My mental health is at an all-time low I must confess. Loneliness kills.

I still have 5-10 close friends that I did not alienate.

But I fear over the years rumors have spread about my whereabouts, and I don't know if I have to explain myself to people or not. I basically failed at ""maintaining appearances"" and have to start over, as it were. And given my tanked status, I fear people will gradually not want to associate with me/this could be a red flag when it comes to finding a relationship.

I went on a date on Friday, with a girl who I liked. It’s important to know that I originally asked her out on a DATE and told her I had feelings for her.

I take her out for lunch, we have a lovely conversation and things seem to be going well. I give her a gift I made for her, it’s a very nice, and romantic gift. (Small sculpture of flowers that she shares a name with) she seems to like them. Anyway, we finish the date and each go home.

We met 6 years ago and were best friends prior to a relationship. We are two hours apart from each other, but before the pandemic she used to dorm over at a university in my city. And I'm also in college right now. Currently, she's staying at her home due to campuses being closed. Every 3 weeks or so, I would drive over to her house and sleepover. During these times, I tried my best to be nice, kind, and respectful towards her parents. Anything I did that bothered them, I would alter it and fit their expectations of me in their home (respectfully so). 

About a month ago, I asked her if she can come over to my house to see my parents again (she has met my parents). So a quick context, she can't drive due to insurance being too expensive for her and her parents don't want to pay for it during COVID times. Also, her parents don't approve of her taking a public bus to see me in fear of spreading the virus. This is understandable, so I would drive over to pick her to up and drive her back to my house. Another quick context, her parents do not like to drive my girlfriend to places, which she has told me that they never did so to see friends or any field trips when she was a kid. They live in a city where public transport is easily accessible. This was also the reason why I went to pick her up. However, I don't like driving back and forth so often because I'll have to admit that I don't like driving, and I get extremely exhausted from driving for more than 3 hours at a time. And on top of this, I was dealing with a stomach infection at the time known as H-pylori, which leaves me extremely nauseous from time to time.

So we decided to try and ask if they were willing to pick her up from my house because I picked her up from her house and drove her to my house to visit/sleepover. They were reluctant and first but then eventually did so (we also made sure they weren't busy at all). A couple of days go by and they tell my girlfriend that they don't want me coming over or her visiting me again because I showed immaturity towards them. They said that it was my responsibility to drive her back to their house because I picked her up. And they professed that it would have been fine if she took the bus over to my house and then they would be alright with picking my girlfriend up (This made no sense to me because they specifically told her that they don't want her ever using the bus because of the virus spread). Also, her parents added that they never liked me from the start and now they definitely don't like me at all.

There is some bad history behind me and her parents before we were together that neither me nor my girlfriend can control and we tried to look past it. I don't want to talk about this history because it's extremely personal, sorry.

It's been a month and a few days ago I offered to clear things up with her parents about their perspective on what had happened. I feel that it was wrong to assume I had mal-intent and was trying to disrespect and be immature towards them. They didn't accept it and got really upset at the offer. Now we both don't know what to do or say towards them. I've lost respect for them a while ago because of the constant misjudgment and treatment they lay upon me and I've done nothing but tried  my best to respect them. I admit that I made a big mistake of asking them to pick her up, however I don't feel as if this was that big of an issue for them to hate me this much. Me and my girlfriend are pretty lost and we don't know what to do about her parents. Can anyone give me some honest and constructive advice? Thank you!

For context, she is the only girl I’ve been with while she has been in (from what I piece together thorough a few conversations) two 1 year+ relationships and several more casual/hookup type things. She is currently working and has her own apartment while I am in my first year of college living with my parents. 

Everything from my first kiss to first sex was shared with her and I wouldn’t want to have done it with anyone else. She is a wonderful person and we have both said we love each other. 

From when she first told me she has been with other guys, I have been wary of asymmetric affection for one another. I don’t say this out of jealousy in any way since she is happier in this relationship than in any other, from the sex to the closeness to our dates. While she is the best thing to happen to me and I am incredibly grateful for her, I can’t help but think if I’ll be able to match her affection. 

Being the only person I’ve been with, she is without a doubt the best person I’ve been with but that decision is not well informed. I have thought about how I could bring this up several ways because she has generally been understanding this being my first relationship and all. After thinking it over, I have decided that I would like to try an open relationship. Definitely not now but in the coming months to a year, I would like to try other girls to see if she is right for me. This way, I can make an informed decision and be more confident if we decide to move in together and pursue something very serious.

I understand that this may seem like a non-issue but I’m just not sure how or when to bring this up with her. Am I just overthinking this? What do you guys think? I feel it would be unfair to withhold this from her for very much longer but I definitely don’t want to cheat or feel unsure about this in any way.

Maybe CAN BE would be a better way to put it. 

I read a comment here that a lot of relationship problems stem from simply one or both people being a bad roommate. It was like a lightbulb went off for me on why I feel annoyed often with my husband. 

Today, I had to remind him (AGAIN) to close the bathroom closet after being in there because we keep the MEDICINE in there and we have a TODDLER. 

Today, I had to remind him (AGAIN) to close the toilet lid and use the toilet lock after using it because we have a TODDLER who would love to explore in there. 

Tonight, I asked him to clean up 3 dishes after his nightly run (I had cleaned up the rest of the house). Two hours later, I go out to the living room, AND THEY'RE STILL THERE. 

Trust me, there's a lot of things he does well and he's a wonderful man. I love him. I also resent being his mom when it comes household stuff. He resents being treated like a child. And it becomes a cycle. 

I'm confident the consistency I'm looking for isn't unreasonable. 

How do I break the cycle without just always cleaning up after him or without doing these things for him? Lower expectations can't be the answer, right???


Before someone suggests ""communication"", I do. I let him know when there's something he missed. I don't do it for him, I ask him to do it. I let him know it bothers me to need to remind him all the time and that I resent it. 

Communication doesn't seem to help. He genuinely seems to care. It seems like it just...isn't in his head to remember these things? He's a loving guy, so it's hard to wrap my head around it. Is it a maturity thing????

EDIT: u/justobsolete suggested maybe there are actual memory problems at play. That's making me think if there isn't something neurological going on, like ADHD. I'm not sure if that can cause memory problems or difficulty building habits, but it's worth looking into. Any insight you might have would be appreciated.

My dad has always been kind of a loose cannon, never held down a job, never had his own place. He was living with his parents until a few years ago when they kicked him out. 
At the time I was living in a small house with my husband, and my father called and told me , not asked, told me that he would be there in an hour because he needed a place to live. 
I stuttered to say no and he hung up. My husband being the sweetheart he is suggested we help. So we did. 
We told him it would be about six months we where willing to help but then he had to fend for himself,  because we where only 20 and newly married at the time and wanted to live alone. 
Well, six months into living there my brother was in a horrific car accident and spent four months in a coma, so I told my dad he could stay until my brother was safe so he didn’t have anything else to worry about. 
Flash forward almost five years and he’s still here. He doesn’t cook, clean or contribute. 
He lets his dog piss all over my house and leaves me to clean it up. 
I buy all the groceries and cook every meal. 
I do his laundry. 
He still doesn’t work and spends all day screaming at his tv because he’s playing call of duty. 
Recently I snapped and told him to help out or get out and he pushed me and my husband, we ended up involving the police. 
With corona we can’t evict him, the police told us they aren’t doing evictions right now. 
Me and my husband have been together ten years and are ready to have a baby, but I don’t feel comfortable or safe having a child while my father lives here.  
Recently my dad has started harassing me about why I’m not giving him grandkids, I need to “get on with it so he can be a grandpa” 
And then he tells me how many kids I’m going to have, what I can and can’t name them. 
I told him I just wanted to adopt one child, and not have any of my own. 
He started yelling at me saying “No. no way. You’re not only having one kid”
I lost my shit and yelled “it’s not fucking up to you pencil dick”
And he said it was, he knew better than me and having one child would be a mistake. 
He’s also now upset with me because me and my husband are buying investment property in a state that he doesn’t like (??)
I don’t see why that matters. 
Anyway, I feel guilt because he’s my father but I’m so anxious, depressed and held back in life right now.

Hello everyone, this is a long one. I apologize, but to those who read it through - thank you. No matter your opinion, I will value it and try my best to understand it.

Today I've decided to end my relationship with my (22M) (ex)girlfriend (21F) of 6 years, we are from the US. 

This has been a decision I've been mulling over for a while, and today I was finally pushed to the point of coming to that decision.

Her and I had a heart-to-heart recently outlining everything: our issues, differences, and opinions. We discussed the paths we want to pursue, our beliefs on marriage and kids, and most importantly the things we've done wrong in the relationship. This was one of the first civil conversations we had and it really put everything in perspective to me.

**What I've Done**

First, I'm going to state what I've done wrong (as her and I discussed) as I feel it's important to have this in mind while reading further. I struggle with communication, it's hard for me to express how I feel and I tend to bottle things up and am ultimately not honest about it. I understand communication is key in any relationship, which is something I've been working on and have been told I've been improving.

In addition, I tend to get irritable/upset in situations that I'm not entirely sure I have a right feel that way. For example, if I'm working I ask to be left alone (I work from home) she doesn't stop and continues to keep talking to me, asking for help with stuff, etc. It ultimately irritates me and causes me to put it straight - I tell her to leave me alone as I'm busy. This is one of the examples I get irritated in, I'm just unsure my reaction is warranted. To note: I do not get physical and never have, I will raise my voice - but not yell.

I've hid things in the past, things I shouldn't have such as messages between me and my cousins, friends, and family. Understandably, she was hurt by this and I lost her trust. I learned this the hard way and have made the changes to be upfront and not do things that I feel the need to hidden. However, prior to losing any trust, she had gone through my phone, logged into all my accounts on her devices, I felt like I wasn't trusted in the first place. She'd get mad at me for my search history and I never understood why.

**What She's Done**

When I say no - she pushes until I say yes. I've said to her in the past no means no and she hadn't gotten the hint. I've turned into a ""yes man"" and I say yes to things I don't even want to do because I know how it ends. This happened with us getting a second dog, happened with us getting an expensive apartment, etc. I lay out the reasons why I say no, but she continues to push.

She has attempted to ""shield"" me from negative things. This goes as far as spending time with my family, she says they take advantage of me by asking for a favor - help with food, a drive somewhere, etc. Not once has anyone ever gotten mad at me for saying no to a favor. When I mention I want to hang out with my cousin, she brings up that they ""take advantage of me."" I feel bad, and just end up not hanging out with anyone.

She's unappreciative of the attempts I make to help her. I tried to take the load of most bills as I understand our income gap and would like her to have some extra money. I pay for most bills, food, needs, and even things she wants. I try to help her in situations where she has to make a tough decision. No matter this, she still says I don't make any effort to help her or make her feel wanted. I've never felt this relationship has been 50/50, it's felt more one-sided than anything.

**Quitting Her Job**

This has to have its own section as it's what ultimately made me come to this decision.

She decided to quit her job due to one person in particular, she stated that person gave her anxiety. I understood this. She wanted to pursue a side business so we outlined a couple options - working on finding another job, cutting her hours, all while pursuing her business opportunity. She pushed for just quitting, without a plan or back-up income, she hasn't made any money from her side business and this put me in a position to pay a lot of things. I make good money, but not enough to afford our bills without living paycheck to paycheck.

She tried to lighten the load by saying she'd use her credit card. I said this decision overall was irresponsible. She quit her job. I had a panic attack and have had heightened anxiety since because of the uncertainty of possibly losing our apartment and everything, especially in the middle of everything going on in the world. After making the decision, she agreed it wasn't a good one, but she had already put me in a position that I felt helpless in.

I've felt this way several times with my job, but I understand that I can't do that as it's a responsibility. I've had major anxiety for a long time and have made the effort to see doctors to help myself push through, I changed my diet, routine, and started exercising. She hadn't made the attempt at all to get help through support lines other than her mom, whom simply seemed to encourage her to quit her job.

**The Breakup**

I've been making the decision the past couple of days after our heart-to-heart and she has been waiting for an answer. I told her I needed time to think as this is a serious decision. She didn't take this well and has been pushing me for an answer and has given me a cold shoulder and an attitude.

I decided to make the decision and she did not take it well. She started saying things like ""When I tell people you broke up with me because I quit my job because I had anxiety... they're gonna..."", ""If you loved me, you'd work through it."" - I feel like I've tried to work through it, but reached the end.

**What I Want To Know**

Any advice on how to handle the breakup? How to move on?

I'm hurt by losing her, I feel as if I made the right decision, but I can't help feeling as if I'm the problem. I don't know how to stop it, even after laying everything out in front of myself.

**TLDR**; Ended my 6 year relationship because I don't know what else to do. I feel trapped in a position that I can't escape and have constant anxiety because the relationship is unpredictable. She quit her job without considering how I felt and this pushed me over the edge. Didn't take the breakup well and said some very hurtful things.

We entered the relationship with this knowledge and both knew it was temporary, however thanks to to Covid my plans got pushed back a year as I am not an internet learning person. So, in October we decided to call it quit and have managed to remain friendly, however both keeping our distance for the most part. Getting close often made both of us wanting to be physical with each other and we both agreed this might not be the best. 

Carrying on, her brother was Immunocompromised and was placed in the hospital recently, and was told last night he wouldn't last much longer. She told me then that she wanted comfort however I was already preoccupied and wasn't able to see her and told her either late Sunday or Monday due to work. She recently just texted me saying how he had passed this morning. 

Do to my own upbringing of mostly raising myself I'm not very good with somber moods and have no idea how to react or what to say in an attempt to comfort people. I've always shouldered the emotions and carried on. She was one of my first more serious relationships since high school and helped me a lot in many things.

 Anyway, I intend to take tomorrow off and try to comfort her but I don't know how I should go about it. I figured something along the lines of getting her to talk about him, and playing music because he got her into punk/jazz and really had a big impact on her life. I am however also lowkey concerned she might ignore the new boundaries we've recently established, and do not know what I would do if she would try to make any attempts at me in some weird effort to comfort herself.

This summer, twice we went in on a bulk purchase together and each time he has gotten upset with how I handled it, ending with him saying he would go NC the last time (in October) despite him still contacting me regularly, which I try to ignore.  
We had a disagreement when I wanted to buy some weed with him. I asked how much he wanted, I found a decent price and checked with him, then went ahead with it. He said it was too little weed for too much money, he said it was very disrespectful to do that, and that I was burdening him and his friend (who he joined in on our deal) for not communicating and that I needed to 'show remorse' and apologize.  
Later in the fall, I organised a day to can tomatoes with some friends and my brother and dad, which was a bit chaotic because we had too few tomatoes and we ended up with over 100 empty jars leftover because of my disorganization and other factors.    
How to split them up and deal with paying people back/splitting the costs when: some friends only wanted a few jars but ended up working 12+ hours on tomatoes, my dad's phone died when he was at the store so he ended up buying way too many jars, my brother left super early in the day, etc?   I planned to sell them online because nobody wanted them, and told everyone that I would let them know how many filled jars they would get/how much it all cost in a couple days because I had a lot of other work to do and it wasn't pressing.   
When I told my brother, he started berating me for the same thing as last time, not consulting with him, crossing boundaries, not respecting him, etc. I feel like the way he was acting was out of line and I didn't have the energy to sort out the headache right then and there, but that wasn't acceptable for him and he blew up at me, declaring he wouldn't talk to me anymore.

I feel like he was acting like a brat, and entitled, but he was saying things like "" I'm tired of your disrespect and your lack of consideration and accountability for your actions. You literally look for the worst in me, i know you do,i can feel it when you speak to me. I'm tired of feeling like I should walk on eggshells with you, you are not worth it.I will call you out I know I'm only doing what is right by you and myself you are really missing out in the way you treat me, I don't enjoy being constantly disrespected by you and hear nothing of remorse or regret. this canning was a test and you failed you crossed my boundaries .We won't be talking for awhile this has been a long time coming Hahahaha.""

This issue has been weighing super heavy in my mind - my fiancé says I am not TA, but I can’t stop thinking about it. 

For background: I (23f) and getting married this Summer to my fiancé (25m) who I love dearly. My mom (59f) and dad (59m)split when I was 5, and I saw him every other weekend growing up. When I was younger I was obsessed with my dad; his house was always fun. But he made a point to talk about how stupid my mom was, would constantly put down her religious beliefs, and just generally tried to turn me against her. It worked for a long time and I had some really screwed up opinions on both my mom AND my dad because of it. 

Cut to when I was 13 - my mom got remarried to my current stepdad. I was not welcoming to him, and my dad spared no time in filling my head with negative thoughts about stepdad too. Meanwhile, stepdad and mom loved me fiercly. They never resorted to being mean to me, and they never took away my visa ruin with dad even though they knew what he was saying/doing when I was with him. 

Over time I grew and matured and was able to see my dad for who he really is. Any time I made a choice or had an opinion he would disagree with, he would go off on a rant about my “manipulative mom” and would insinuate that she was using me to “keep torntuing him after all these years”. To add context, these choices/opinions included things like: wanting to stay with mom one Thanksgiving bc I had strep, wanting to attend a homecoming dance on his allotted weekend, attending a mission trip event with my church at age 15 (he actually called the church and accused them of kidnapping me). I eventually had less and less contact with him when I went to college, and I haven’t seen him much since my high school graduation bc he moved across the country. 

Now fast forward to present day. In prepping for my wedding I realized that it would mean a lot to me and my stepdad if he were to walk me down the aisle with my dad. My plan is to have one of each side of me as we walk. My stepdad was so touched that he cried and immediately accepted. When I asked my dad, he exploded and said that would humiliate him. He says that my stepdad has gotten to be there for so much of my life and he, my real dad, should get to have this honor on his own. He also said that no respectful daughter would make this choice and is refusing to come to my wedding unless my stepdad is removed from the party. I feel I may be TA bc this is his one chance to have that special dad moment and I am taking it from him - I have an older sister but he was not invited to her wedding bc their relationship is much worse.

A little story. I met her at school. We were together for a year. We never fought, she understood me, I understood her.

She was going overseas to study, and we agreed not to keep the relationship going. However, I naively accepted to stay in touch with her by her request.

I was fine for three weeks, then she told me she had feelings for another guy. I broke down and had an anxiety/panic attack for the first time in my life. Did all the typical things a desperate ex shouldn’t do, like texting her I love her, begging her to come back. Of course, none of it worked.

At some point I started seeing a therapist, and I was at the lowest low in my life. She told me she was seeing someone, to which I told her not to talk to me anymore because I couldn’t pretend to be her friend (She asked to stay friends). A week later they break up, and she goes to me to vent about it. In the meantime, every time she does this I relapse and go to a dark place again and again, but I listened because I cared about her. Many times I stay on until she goes to sleep, for her sake.

I tell her I don’t want to hear it, but she keeps coming back to me to talk about it. She falls for another guy, guy tells her otherwise within a week: same thing happens.

I told her I can’t be her support person because it messes me up but she insists she doesn’t have or doesn’t know who else to go to. I feel and know she’s abusing my compassion for her, and I’m sick of it. At the time of writing, she hasn’t done this for about two weeks.

The other thing that makes me resent her in a way is that she’s currently going to the school she wanted to go to, going out and partying every other night and meeting people while I’m stuck at home, and she complains to me about her predicament. It feels insensitive, and the two times I opened up to her about something she practically blew me off.

I went NC for about two weeks. Deleted all my social media, deleted my messenger app so I wouldn’t see her messages or get the urge to talk with her.

But I broke. I reinstalled my messenger app to see she messaged me about feeling sick and asking if she could call. She had sent the message the day before.

I message her and we chat for I’d say half an hour, and she’s feeling fine. The next morning I couldn’t resist the urge to ask her what she wants from me, and she tells me to be friends, same as always. I ask her if she thinks she’s been treating me as a friend, and asks “Have i not been?”

At this point I’m sick of caring for her when she doesn’t show any sort of compassion back. I feel like she’s abusing my heart, and I don’t understand why I can’t bring myself to burn the bridge and cut her off. 

Like right now, I have this urge to reach out to her, just to hear her and tell her how I’m feeling, make her feel bad about the things she’s done to me, but I don’t think she cares anyway. And I want her to miss me, I want her to continue reaching out to me.

So a few months ago, I met this guy online, and he and I started talking and we instantly clicked. We would literally call each other every day for 12 hours each time for a while and everything was amazing. We even told each other we liked each other three days after we met. On one of those calls, we talked about past relationships we had been in, and he told me he’s been very badly hurt before, and he never wanted to go through that again. But he had told me that I was the first person he had met in years that he actually considered dating. There was an issue though, which was that once I move to the U.S. in march, we're gonna live 10 hours away from each other. Even though I was okay with long distancing it, he wasn't for so long, so we eventually agreed on a plan. Since I had just started college, we decided to wait until I was a senior (which is a little less than 3 years from now) and then see if we still wanted to be in a committed relationship or not. So a few weeks later we decided to meet for new years. I had told him that if I went and met him, there was a high possibility that I would grow more attached to him, and if he didn’t want that to happen, then I should just not go. He still insisted that I went so I did.

I spent five days with him, and I can say that those days have been one of the best days of my life. And just like I had expected, I grew very attached to him. However, a week had passed since I had left and he hadn’t spoken to me once. I am a very big over thinker, and I started thinking that he had met me and didn’t like me, which was very hard because meeting him made me realize how much I liked him since I had never felt that way about anyone in my life and how much I was willing to do in order for us to work later on. So I decided to FaceTime him and ask him straight up how he felt about the trip, and he told me that he wanted to distance himself from me because he said that us talking the way we did before was just gonna make us hate each other, which made absolutely no sense to me and frustrated me a lot. That call eventually led us to have our first fight because I didn’t understand what he told me in the moment and I didn’t want to.

Eventually I did some thinking, and what he said started to make sense. Because he had been in a similar situation before, he knew more about it than I did, and I decided to trust what he said. So a few days later, we had a follow up call where I told him I was willing to do what he said, as long as the final goal was for us to be in a relationship, and he said that the reason he wanted to distance himself from me was because he wanted to preserve what we had from the start, and that if we kept talking so much we’d eventually hate each other because it’s not like we’re right there to see each other and the situation would frustrate us so much that we’d take it out on each other. He had also said that he's the type of person that the more he talks to someone, the more he wants to see them and be with them. Also, because we agreed to keep our options open and to still be open to meeting other people, if he was to meet someone else where a relationship was easier to work, or vice versa, it would hurt less if we weren't too attached to each other, which makes a lot of sense.

While I was trying to make sense of this, though, I talked to my friend about it, and she told me that it was a lot more likely for me to meet someone else, since I’m moving to the states for the first time in my life in a month, and I’m going to be meeting tons of new people, meanwhile he’s going to be staying in the same place he’s been living in for his whole life and its a lot less likely for him to meet someone else, so he’s doing it as a way to protect himself from getting hurt again.

The thing is, I am willing to wait for a few years since I don’t really want to be in a serious relationship right now, especially since I’m going to get to experience a lot of new things, but he doesn’t want me to do that because he thinks I’ll resent him for restricting myself to him and not being open to being with others. He’s clearly a lot more experienced than me, and I haven’t gotten to experience a lot of things he has, which I'm guessing is another reason he's doing this. 

I told him I was willing to do whatever it takes so that three years from now we can actually be in a relationship where we have to either drive ten hours or fly somewhere else, and we could be together. But as much as I know I have to, I don't want to stop talking to him or distance myself from him the way he says we should, because I am willing to wait and stay single for 3 years for him. My worry is that he doesn't think the same, and I know that I will be very upset if one day he is to tell me that he met someone who lives 30 minutes away from him and he doesn't have to be dealing with this bullshit, so he wants to cut things off with me. (Like I said earlier, I know he thinks it's more likely for that to happen with me, but I don't necessarily agree with the fact that I'd resent him for shutting myself off from others since it's my decision, but I just hoped he felt the same way and I wouldn't be worrying so much about him meeting someone else.)

So my thing is, is it worth it to stay attached to him with the hopes that we can actually be together in three years? And if not, how do I detach myself from him when every day I miss him more and I can’t get him out of my head. I can say with certainty that this is the first time I’ve actually been in love with someone, and I don’t know if I will ever meet someone that I get along with so well and that will eventually lead me to fall in love the same way I did with this guy, and the thought of losing him scares me very very much.

Also, I know this situation is very different and I doubt there’s gonna be anyone who has gone through something like this, but if anyone has any advice to make this easier to deal with, I’ll take anything :)",0,0,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,self,This guy and I really like each other but we can't be in a relationship for 3 years and now he doesn't want to talk to me anymore.,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/kwccjg/this_guy_and_i_really_like_each_other_but_we_cant/,all_ads,2.0

Posting under a different title as the last one had a few troll answers we had to remove. Good times.

Gather round as I tell you a tale from the year 2020....... I was dating a great guy (36) and he was everything I wanted on paper. We had trouble in the bedroom he struggled to get hard and while is larger in body size was very small in the penis. Sorry no idea how else to put that. I can try dance around it but ultimately this was an issue. I never made a thing about any of it and just worked with it. I was very supportive about it and we dated for many more months.

He is supportive and driven. He is caring and kind. We want the same things in life. I want babies and marriage and all that jazz and he does too. He has a house and his shit together. Well you know as much as anyone can in 2020.

Fast forward through two lockdowns and some health issues and I ended up having a total break down. It wasn’t pretty guys. And while I could blame a pandemic we have all come to know. I think it was more to do with a past trauma resurfacing. But I was a mess. Anxiety, depression.... the works. Classy. So I didn’t want to drag him through that and ended the relationship to get my shut together. Even though he was supportive. I just couldn’t handle relationship, sex issues and my stuff. If that makes sense. He sort of implied we could try again later or see how things go.

Fast forward a few months and I’m doing heaps better. Thanks for asking hahah. Counseling, exercise, working through some hard stuff and meds. So I’m not 100 percent by a long shot but I’m doing better.

My friend saw him on a dating app last night he hasn’t been on. He is totally within his rights. Heck I have even been on them in the last month for a total of like two days just to see if I was interested in someone or still not. Although dating apps just suck. So who knows. Anyway back to this long story.... it has really knocked me back. I want to reach out and be like that’s not ok behaviour Hahahah obviously I’m not going to.

Do I let it go? Do I message him and try again? Should I write this off as a 2020 thing?

My friend asked if I was sad because he was my back up and that hit me hard. I don’t want to do that to someone. But I don’t want to muck him around if I’m not ready. Who is ever ready though and it’s not like I haven’t been trying really hard to work on me.

Dating him would mean I would have issues in the bedroom. My last ex wouldn’t touch me because he hated sex and this guy wants to but can’t get it up. None of this should matter. But if anyone would like to give me a reality check I’m listening! Lord knows I’ve worked through enough stuff so what’s a little more?

We mainly hangout at school,  he invites me to get stuf at the store, stuff like that. Hes a good friend definitely.  but we rly get along well  I just get the sense that he likes other kids more.

We've known each other since birth so we are fairly close. Last week my cousin and a guy friend of ours at college had a race based on a bet, it was a short 30 meters race intended as a joke but I told her that she shouldn't have done it since college is a formal place and she shouldn't run around. Later on we went to a birthday party for our friend and she told me that one of the guys there gave her a judgemental look and asked me why and I told her it was either because of the race or other things that she does (e.g. she has curly hair and I told her its inappropriate for college).

I should point out that we live in a conservative place where people always talk.

After mentioning the race she seemed upset even though I was just trying to look out for her.
After that incidence, I told her that she should tell one of our guy friends that he shouldn't play music when walking around campus since it's kinda cringe (she knows him better than me) she said that he doesn't play it loud enough to disturb anyone and would only be heard by walking next to him to which I said the idea is the same and she should look out for him. Directly after she told me she would appreciate it if I could keep from judging her or her friends and I told her I didn't realize I was but she insisted and now I'm wondering

Not cheap glass. She had a surplus of a custom batch (so not able to buy the glass elsewhere), that she was selling for about $20 sqft. Shipped priority mail from FL to PA. 
I watched the tracking info and suspected a problem when it took 19 days, and bounced between 3 FL post offices for most of that time.
The day it arrived, I knew there was a problem before I even picked the box up from the chair on my porch. It looked pretty beat up.
I knew that unless there was a miracle, there would be broken glass inside, so I took many photos beginning before I even opened the box.
As suspected, almost 2/3 of the glass was shattered into 3-5"" pieces (pretty useless for my need),  another piece was broken into 3 large pieces, and only 2 sheets were completely intact.
The packaging was fair to good, but not great. Foam at the corners, but simply paper between sheets.
I immediately contacted her to file a claim with postal service (must be done by shipper, not recipient), and forwarded a few of the photos.
She opened a claim but did nothing with it.
She sent me a screen shot that said wait 7-10days.
I waited 2 weeks then contacted her.she said she hadn't heard anything,  but would check.
Got back with me that the message was that it was ""in review""
Then comes Thanksgiving and into dec.
A full 7 weeks after the claim was filed(after jan 1), I sent her another message inquiring. She simply stated the claim was denied.
I am pretty irritated at this point. I've spent $70 on glass that is mostly unusable. Sell has no skin in the game to appeal the denied claim -shes not out any money, i am-, and refuses to file an appeal when I pushed back that she should do so.
She got pissy with me when I asked her to refund half of the money.
I've debated bringing this to the attention of the group admins to perhaps have her selling privileges monitored.

I have sole custody of 7 year old twins. My boyfriend is the first guy I’ve seen since having the twins. Up until they were 4 it was just me &amp; them. 

When I met him it was intense and amazing. His wife died of cancer 15 years ago and he’s never really had a serious relationship since then until me. He moved in after six months. He told me he wanted to marry me. He told my kids he wanted to marry me. He took me to a jewellers to get my engagement ring finger measured. He promised he’d love me always and I felt and still feel the same. 

A month after our one year anniversary he unexpectedly broke up with me and utterly devastated me. He said he couldn’t handle the pressure of family life. 

He didn’t go away though. We carried on sleeping together, he’d spend whole weekends with us as a family, he was always there if I needed him even if it inconvenienced him etc. Eventually I said I couldn’t see him if he couldn’t commit. We didn’t see each other for two months. Those two months for me were extremely hard. 

He then messaged me to let me know a family friend had died. We started talking again. We (eventually) ended up back together (a year after we first split up). 

What I’m not sure about is if I should just face the fear of the hideous hurt of not being with him because he just doesn’t seem that into me anymore. We see each other once or twice a week. I’d like more. He rarely says he loves me. I say I love him quite a lot (not an insane amount - a few times a week). He’s not very affectionate. I am. I message him random stuff and he just replies ‘XX’. I absolutely can talk to him about these things and I do. He just says he’ll try harder but then doesn’t really. Am I a fool for hoping he’ll change? A couple of times I’ve said I can’t carry on and then he’s lovely for a few weeks before lapsing back into slightly disinterested. Should I finish it for good? It feels at the moment that I start to try to leave then just as I do he becomes the man I fell in love with so I don’t. I know I am very scared of being alone again.

We have been arguing over the last few days and things weren't getting any better so I suggested we take a small break from each other to think things over because we kept hitting a brick wall when trying to resolve our issues. Half way through our break (roughly 12 hours in) I discovered that she had posted 1 second stories on her social media stories saying things like ""I hope she's nice \*my replacement"". I'm assuming that she is suggesting that I'm cheating on her or that I am seeing someone else when I'm not. I have repeatedly said to her that I would not invest my time with someone if I wasn't committed. I have reassured her that I want a long term relationship and that trust means everything to me, so making her feel this way is the last thing I want.

She has does this before in the past when we have had arguments that haven't gone well. For instance when I have felt like we are just going in circles and not resolving the issue I will hang up out of frustration. She will then call me back a few minutes later asking ""I hope she's really pretty"", ""Are you talking to someone would you like me to leave you guys alone?"" and ""I bet she's blonde and skinny"". I have asked her previously why she has said things like this, her answer has almost always been something like ""I was upset in the moment that's why I said it"". Is this a normal thing to do when upset? She has also stated before that due to past relationships she suffers from being insecure. Is that a reasonable reason for acting this way?

This only occurs when we argue, never when we are in a good place.

What should I do? Am I doing something wrong, am I not reassuring her enough?

How can I disabuse my ex of any idea that there's a chance of us getting back together?

She became extremely possesive and controlling after we started living together and after 6 months I left. We broke up and got back together quite a few times during the 3 years we were together and for this reason she won't let go of the idea that we'll eventually get back together this time. It's now been 4 months since I moved out. 

I don't have any hard feelings towards her and I only wish her happiness. She's had several extremely traumatic experiences due to being a persecuted minority and living in Damascus at the height of the Syrian civil war, and these things have greatly contributed to her being the way she is. I would tell her she should seek psychological help and she'd respond by accusing me of gaslighting but now she says she'll think about it. All of her family is in Syria except for some cousins she has here who don't seem to understand the gravity of the situation there.

Reasons being I travel a lot for work. I stay in a different hotel room each week, and my fiance stayed with his parents to save money and to pay his debts. We made it worked with travels, frequent visits, and good communication. 


Our only difference in our relationship is our views on COVID 19. 


When COVID started happening, we were in the middle of moving in together. I was visiting my parents in Louisiana to load a truck full of furniture my family wanted to give me. My fiance in Arizona to quit his job. We had a lease signed in Nevada. Jobs lined up. 


Lockdowns started being declared. People didn't care about COVID. Calling it a hoax.


I stayed at my parents for a month after finding a job online and my fiance stayed at his parents, keeping his job. 


4 members of my family died early in May. They had no pre-existing conditions. Were healthy individuals. A month later, 2 more. I've seen what COVID can do and it's a dangerous disease. 


I'm terrified of COVID. I respect the rules. Wear a mask. Wash my hands and my groceries. I avoid contact with people outside of my bubble. 


My fiance thinks it's a hoax. His parents are pro Trump. He's more on the leftist side but is influenced by them as they live in the same house. 


My fiance has never been on a plane before and he's scared of flying. 


We've been away from each other for half a year and he's lonely. He goes through depression. Cry at night. He told me tonight that he doesn't feel anything when he's depressed. It's difficult to get through him. We FaceTime every night and talk constantly. But on nights like tonight, where he just cries and begs me to book a plane ticket and possibly putting my health at risk, I feel powerless. 


He asked me to get a plane ticket and visit him. I said no, especially given how many cases there are right now. Every time I say no and explain why, he gets even more depressed.

Unfortunately I did not have physical proof of this or have any witnesses. I am married and pregnant with mine and my husband’s first child. I’m very happy in my marriage, and did not insinuate in anyway that I would be open to an affair. 
It honestly came out of left field and I was flabbergasted that it happened. Since then I have made it a point not to talk to John, as he is also not someone that I need to have conversations with often regarding tasks at work. 
John has also slacked off immensely in his work, as is noticed by the entire office. He quit showing up on time, and stopped doing routine tasks that are required of the job, I honestly don’t know how he hasn’t lost his job. 
John knows that I do not like him, and we are not friends. He has complained to management that he feels he cannot ask me work related questions. There are 2 other coworkers he can ask said questions to as well. Anytime John tries to make small talk with me, it’s regarding my husband or my baby. This makes me very uncomfortable, and I have made it clear to my bosses that I will never talk about these things with him, and he needs to stop pressing me with these questions. I’m wondering if I’m TA because my boss has said twice now that I need to “be nicer and kinder with my words and the way in which I deliver them.” I do not use a rude tone, nor am I mean to him. I am curt and keep my answers to his work related questions short, and do not really answer his attempts at personal questions. So, AITA for not “being kinder” to this coworker?

Edit: Thank you for the award! And thank you all for your responses. Here’s to another work day I hope we all make it through. Thank you for the advice!

UPDATE: talked with my boss again this morning, we’ll call him Ben, he works more directly with me than John’s direct boss, we’ll call him Fred. Ben agrees that the ball was dropped on the situation and that disciplinary action is needed. Ben is frustrated with his co-owner Fred for “defending” John. I explained that I feel I have been wrongly blamed for John’s behavior, and Ben agrees, and stated it is unacceptable. Ben also insinuated that John’s time here at the company is coming to an end. I pointed out to Ben that John is being manipulative and narcissistic. Ben recognized this as well. Ben apologized again on Fred’s behalf for the lack of discipline, and assured me something that Ben himself will take care of the situation. Sooo we’ll see what happens!

EDIT #2: thank you all so much for the advice, kind words, and well wishes. It gave me the courage to stand up for myself and make it clear where I stand.

I recently moved in with my older sister due to covid related issues. Lost my job, my insurance, and I had to find a place in a new city for myself as well as my two fur balls. My sister had an open room, I was fully aware this wasn’t going to be perfect moving in. We’re sisters and we end up having a tiff of sorts at least every week or so. 

One of our neighbors, sister’s best friend, and the alleged thief “B”. B is pretty much impossible to avoid and spends the most time in the apartment. At my sister’s urging I unpacked and put my medications into the bathroom medicine chest (it’s mostly mine but guests use it). I usually kept them in my room, I’m lazy and remembering to take meds is much easier when they’re directly in my face. 

After unpacking I noticed I was having trouble focusing on studying so I went looking for my Adderall. I noticed I only had one pill left which immediately tipped me off. I don’t take Adderall every day, and I easily had 20 pills last time I checked. Whoever ripped me off had a heart to leave me one pill.

After alerting my sister she was first apologetic. Now she simply makes excuses for her friends so they can come over here. 

I’m fully aware who ripped me off amongst her friends, and she happens to be our neighbor. I see her constantly, and my sister doesn’t respect the fact that her friends make me uncomfortable. She even said if one of my friends had ripped her off they wouldn’t be allowed back in the apartment ever.

Every time I see B it just fills me with anger. She never apologized, she wouldn’t even admit it. She’s almost 10 years older than me. (I’m 28, so it says a quite a bit about her character.) 

My sister claims she barely has any friends, and these are the ones that will hangout with her. I’ve been passive, but my sister is getting more irritated because I’m not just getting over it. I get mildly irritated when she asks if B can come over. Even if I say no my sister invites her over anyways.

I'm struggling a lot with this because on the one hand I try to fully believe when someone says they're being abused but on the other hand I haven't seen any evidence of it. I have been in emotionally abusive relationships before so I feel like I can see the signs but with this none of it is there (put downs/controlling etc.)

It's very difficult as my dad has become difficult to talk to and combative. He's diagnosing my mom with a mental illness and has seemed to change a lot to the extent that I find it difficult to be around him. He's on medication and is seeing a therapist. None of it adds up in my mind and hearing him say all these horrible things about my mom upsets and confuses me.

I feel bad for not believing him but surely I'd have picked up on something over the past 30 years?

I've tried shutting down the conversation and not getting involved but it's difficult when my mom gets upset at something he's said.

Does anyone know any resources on this kind of thing? The ones I know eg love is respect don't align with what I know of their marriage.

I know the best answer is to stay out of it but it's very difficult and it feels like my whole past and childhood is being rewritten. I feel like it's ruining my relationship with my dad because I just don't get where he's coming from and if I ever question it he gets very upset and angry.

But husband took the guy by the neck and started dragging him out, cussing, screaming, calling my daughter vulgar names. This guy was obviously close to my daughter's age so he wasn't grooming her or anything. My husband is pretty built so this guy was pretty scared, and I felt terrible.

It's all just kind of hit me, the things I do that have culminated into me kind of breaking down every night when I'm home alone even if I had a good and positive day.

I dated Gabby for 5 years. It was healthy, it was exceptional, wouldn't give it back for the world. But it ended, and we're both for the better as a result. I've known Taylor for the last decade. After I got back home from college about a year and a half ago, we quickly reconnected (hadn't talked in a few years), and since then we've become each other's best friends. I've had very close best friends, and I know I've known real love. But not like her, not like Taylor.

T and I tried to date for a bit after we reconnected. I knew she was for me, but she got back with her ex. It's clear to us both that we love each other, but she's not in love and I'm in love with her. I've tried my dudes. I've tried to be normal friends. She's still my closest friend, and besides my own feelings eating me up it's the healthiest God damn relationship I've ever had. Communication and trust are so so strong and present in our relationship. It brings me the most joy, the most motivation to be better, and I hold more care towards her and that friendship than I have with anyone else. And trust me, my other friends I hold dear to my heart, so it means a lot that I feel this way.

It's been almost 8 months since T and I stopped dating. My feelings are still here, and they're only growing. They started as feelings of peace and hope, and have turned into this monster that keeps me depressed when I'm alone. Happiest with her, saddest without her. 

I'd probably be better off just cutting ties. I try to meet other girls. I've met girls that I seriously like. I'll hangout with them a few times a think ""hey maybe I could dig this person"". Then I hangout with T and in an instant I think of that girl I just met, and say ""But they're just not T"". So I'm fucked is what I'm saying. I either keep my most valued relationship and probably ruin the chance to be able to invest my energy into someone else for who knows how long, or I end it, and maybe have the chance to meet someone else I feel that strongly for. Worst thing though? We're in the same tight-knit friend group, and neither of us could handle leaving our beautiful friends. So, for better or worse I'm stuck with her in my life anyway.

Oh and my ex that I mentioned? I do enjoy G's company. She's a fun person and a beautiful human. Our time as a real working couple has very likely passed. and we're fairly content with that fact. 

Here's the dilemma with G:
I yearn for serious emotional connection. And, if I don't pry myself away from T and take a shot on someone else, I won't have the energy to put into someone else to get to a point where I can have the emotional connection I want. And there's only 1 other person that can give that to me, even if just for an hour or two. That's G. With or without that short time of emotional connection, I'm sorta just depressed about my current situation anyway. So, yeah. I don't really know what to do.

If you read this far for some god forsaken reason, thanks I suppose. And some advice: Life does go on, and it gets better if we work to make it better.

On mobile so sorry for any formatting issues. So today I went to my university's library to work on a paper that's due at midnight for the class I took over winter break. As always, before getting down to business I was messing around on my computer. I was deleting a bunch of things I no longer needed and came across a file called ""System 32"" I didn't recognize it, never seen it before, and couldn't figure out what it was. Because of this my dumb self decided to delete all of the contents in my pursuit of decluttering my PC. 

However, I had no idea that System 32 is actually the computers operating system. I then installed some updates which required my computer to restart. Well anyone familiar with computers is probably groaning right now. Because I didn't have an operating system, I kept getting error messages. It kept asking for the BitLocker key, bit every time I entered it my laptop would just start the blue screen process over again. I then tried troubleshooting, resetting my computer and trying to figure out where I fucked up. I tried unistalling the most recent updates. Nothing. 

Finally I called Microsoft support, while still googling the issue on my phone. It finally hit me that maybe all those files I deleted from the mystery folder were important. I told the customer service guy what I did and he has been helping my bypass the BitLocker so I can reset my PC. Now I'm sitting here waiting for the reset to finish and feeling like an idiot because I wasted over an hour when I could have made significant progress on my paper. It's at 97% and I have my fingers crossed that this will actually work but also feeling sick to my stomach about the amount of time I have left to turn in my assignment.

Like many, I started to think that I’d rather die than live the miserable work loop.  The entertainment industry is so exploitive that I was being watched like a hawk by managers, having timed bathroom breaks (If you were in the bathroom more than 5 mins you’d get reprimanded) and other constant belittlement by the company.  I was beyond burned out.  In summer 2019, I finally cracked and chose to quit my job without any prospects of getting a different one.  It was incredibly reckless from a normal person’s perspective, but to me it was simply the tipping point.  With only a couple thousand saved up, I realized I had to relocate out of the insanely expensive Los Angeles, where I had been living in the past decade.  I moved 2000 miles to a state with a much lower cost of living.  I have a creative profession, where essentially I am paid to create artistic products.  Shortly after moving to my new city, I picked up a remote job at a company and I have been taking full advantage wherever I can.  Basically, the company has no idea that what I produce for them in a work week actually only takes me something like 10 hours of committed work.  But they absolutely adore my work and couldn’t be happier with me at the company.  They think I’m a superstar.  They believe I’m working my ass off but since the job is remote there’s no way for them to know what I’m really doing all day.  I’m just astounded at this enormous change in my life, from absolute misery to being loved for my talents.  This, I think, is further proof of how bullshit office culture is - it’s the product that matters, not the means to get there.  If I can produce something that a company finds extremely valuable in just a few hours, then shouldn’t that be all that matters?  If they want to believe it took me 40 hours then fine, but this proves to me that what I do has always been very valuable.

I made the mistake of entertaining the idea of getting back with my ex after I left him. He wanted to get back together so much (apparently) that he would work on our issues, we would go therapy etc. things were going okay, we spent two nice weekend together but not much in between. He felt like because I left I owed it to prove to him I wanted this, though I left..because of the things he was doing. Anyway, I mentioned to him his lack of effort/unwillingness to bend, why was he being so distant, not putting in the effort if he wanted this? 

He said that this wasn’t going to work anymore and I believe it’s because he’s pretty set in his ways and didn’t want to change for the better. He had a drinking problem, hard time communicating, etc. so I said okay well I’m going to block you then. He understands and I’m like “ok then, take care, best of luck” and he says “I miss you so much 😭” so I’m again like good luck and he says “you too 💔”

30 minutes later he invites my best friend to a Valentine’s Day party at his house (the one we shared)..likely because he knew she would tell me, because he knows she wouldn’t go to this event. He knows that if I saw this it would bother me, also the people invited were private and it was public (so I could see it if I wanted). 

Why is he like this? Why spend a month trying to get back together, to be like “nevermind” but still say he loves me so much? 

Is he just acting this whole time? Is it revenge because  I left so he has left me now? Is he hoping that I change my mind and chase him? What are your thoughts.

My bestfriend L and I met in kindergarten. We became bestfriend and grew up together. In middle school we met M and the 3 of us became inseparable. It was the kind of childhood friendship that define your life, and it lasted until last year.

L and I have always been a little bit closer, because our families are very close, we come from the same social class (M has always been a little bit more privileged when it comes to money), and we both struggle with the same mental health issues (anxiety and depression which M doesn't share). Right now L lives abroad so I see her like 3 or 4 times a year but M and I still lived in the same city or region.

So long story short last year I spent 5 months in another country and those 5 months were really difficult. I spent those months very depressed and when I came back early because I was starting to have really dark thoughts lockdown started in my country so I spent 2 months locked in an apartment with my boyfriend. Let's just say it was really *really* hard for me but luckily L, my boyfriend and other people I cared about were helping me a lot. M wasn't. She has never understood the concept of depression, to her it's not even an illness but more of at state of mind, and has told us stuff in the past that were pretty hurtful (Like she doesn't understand why depressed people just don't kill themselves if they can't get better, or that I am weak for not being able to get better) but we always forgave her because she can be an amazing friend.

M came to see me when I was abroad, I few weeks before I came back home. I was so happy she came but truth is the trip was very difficult for the both of us. We fought a lot. A few examples of the arguments we had: we were talking about the political situation in our country and we didn't agree on it at all, I didn't want to be arguing about it so I told her I didn't want to debate anymore. She started getting angrier, pushing the debate on me when I told her repeatedly that I wanted us to stop. She then started attacking me personally by telling me debating with me was difficult because I only cared about facts and can be very stubborn (Which is true, I'll admit) and that she hates that she can never change my mind and I make her feel stupid when I only focus of facts and that everybody thinks that of me and that she wants me to change who I am for everybody's good (I then talked about it to our friends they all said she lied and that she's too prpud and has a habit of lying to get the last word). It hurt a lot, I ended up crying and so did she but we moved on. 

Later that week we were talking about the concept of depression because I told her I was going through a really rough time and she tried to be nice but she told me she doesn't understand how people could feel so low, and that she doesn't feel empathy for depressed people because when *she* feels low she needs some tough love, and to get motivated and then she feels better so if she can do it everybody can. She also said depressed people made her feel bad so she hates being around them. I disagreed but I have learnt not to argue with her on this so I moved on.

Anyway, I came back home, spent 2 months in lockdown where I barely talked to M and at the end of it she sent a text in the group chat asking how L and I were doing. I told her I was doing good but considering going to a psychiatrist to help with my mental health. She immediately said that it was a bad idea and that I would be put on meds etc...And that I should try natural medicine instead. I told her that I understood her point of view but that I was hurt that she didn't support me at all and that she never took the time to text me during the last 2 months to ask me how I was doing. She responded that I could have texted her too and that we were just ""drifting appart but that it was ok"". Truth is there she was right, I could have texted her too but since she told me depressed people bothered her and at that time I needed support I knew she wasn't the one I should be talking to. Anyway, after that conversation I decided that I didn't consider her my friend anymore and that she was toxic for me and I was done with her.

I talked about it with L and she supported me by telling me M was being immature and toxic and that I was right to feel hurt and that she sometimes felt the same way about M and had a hard time considering her her bestfriend anymore.

Time passed. L came back for the summer and we spent some time together with our friend groups so I hung out with M as well, things were a bit tense but I was friendly and considerate of her feelings. I thought we were ok. She even wished me a happy birthday. This winter L came back again and we spent new year's Eve all together and it went well but I could see M was avoiding me but I didn't say anything about it. Last night I was celebrating L's birthday and M wasn't there. L told me she was planning to go skiing with our group of friend and M but that I wasn't invited because M decided she wasn't comfortable having me around anymore. L is a little bit bothered by that but she told me that she understands her views too and that it is not her place to have an opinion because M has apparently been hurt by me too so she doesn't want to take side.

This is where I'm hurt and lost. L has always told me that M was also toxic to her, that she understands how bad she hurt me but now she just...doesn't want to take side because since M is being a good friend to her it is no big deal that she hurt me in the past. I don't know, maybe I am being childish but I feel like I am being punished for deciding I deserved better than the friendship M had to offer me. Besides that I am also wondering what I did wrong and if I am being the toxic one because apparently I hurt M too but I really don't want to confront her because she has been manipulative in the past and I really don't want to put myself through that again.

Truth is I hate that L, and also most of our friends in common, all say that they understand that I was hurt but nobody is really standing up for me. I don't know, maybe I am asking too much, but this is making me feel really alone. Only my boyfriend is really supporting me in this situation. I guess I just feel really hurt today because of that but I am also second guessing myself, maybe I was being the toxic one, maybe I should talk to M again to make things right.

What do you think?

Tl;dr: My friend M and I ""broke up"" because I realised she was making me feel really bad and unhappy and we argued a lot and our bestfriend L supported me at first but now she kind of forgot what M put me and her through and still consider her her bestfriend and it makes me feel really alone.",0,0,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,self,My (22F) bestfriend (22F) is defending my toxic friend (23F) and I don't know what to do,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/l2rn22/my_22f_bestfriend_22f_is_defending_my_toxic/,all_ads,2.0

The outbreak in my country is really bad and specially in my city, hospitals are still overflowed with patients and oxygen is scarce so we're not risking it.
Since then i haven't seen my boyfriend (m 22) but we cope up with this by spending a lot of time talking or playing online games together. 3 months ago, he started working again and now he barely has enough time to sleep, his job is very physically demanding and after such a long time out of it, he's been adjusting back slowly.
A few days ago when we were talking he told me that he was worried because I've been distant and haven't been telling him that i love him (I'm the kind of person that basically start and ends every call or text saying this), i told him I've been feeling weird and numb this last few weeks, we talked about how we're both coping with not talking as much as before and he was worried because we've both have depression at some point of our lives. He told me he understood how i was feeling and not to worry about it, he promised to make some extra time so we can talk a bit more.
Yesterday i was talking to a friend about all this and she called me an asshole for not ""keeping my man"", she called me out for not treating him better and told me i was supposed to just deal with my moods and make him feel loved regardless of how i was feeling, that it was a real asshole move to tell him i didn't have strong feelings for him right now and that feeling numb is not an excuse.

I've been raising my niece (Hannah) since since she was less than one year old. She's now 14. Her biological mother was my older sister and she was an addict. She tried to get clean, but relapsed a few months after Hannah's birth and disappeared completely after that. She died a few years later. No one in the family could take Hannah in and I didn't want her to end up in the foster system, so my girlfriend (who is now my wife) and I took her in. We're the only mothers Hannah has ever known.

When speaking directly to us, Hannah refers to us as her aunts, but I've recently noticed that she has begun to call us her mothers when talking to her friends. It's very recent. That doesn't bother us in the least, since we consider her our child. Plus, we have another daughter who is 7 and who obviously calls me and my wife ""mom"", so we can see why Hannah has started to do the same.

I'll be honest, I almost cried the first time I heard her say that and I've never explicitly discouraged it. My parents and other sister came over for Christmas (there are no virus cases in our area) and we invited Hannah's best friend and her parents as well, since their relatives live in another country and they had no one to spend Christmas with. My family heard Hannah refer to me as her mother and lost it.

My mother told me I was disrespecting my sister's memory and my other sister called me disgusting for trying to replace her. All of this happened in private and Hannah heard none of that, but it still broke me.

I was raised to be a lady, proper, dainty, helpless. I hated it. I wanted nothing more as a child than to be a boy, I thought God had made a mistake. I rebelled at every turn. I got dirty, I played rough and never let being a girl hold me back. 

I grew up and out of my belief that something was wrong with me. That took some serious soul searching. I finally pinpointed the question that I struggled with was what defined a woman? 

I grappled with that seemingly simply question. Was it the clothes and the make-up? I brushed that off as too superficial. You don't suddenly become less of a woman for washing your makeup off and changing your clothes.

Was it adjectives used to describe woman, such as soft, gentle, dainty? Again I rejected this line of thought because they were social constructs, mere suggestions at what is expected of a specific sex. They are fluid and change with the culture, so are no closer to a definition than I.

What about menstruation? While menstruation is exclusive to females, does one become something else when going through menopause? No, again this definition fell flat for me. 

What it finally boiled down for me was shockingly simple. What makes a woman are two X chromosomes...

Now before everyone jumps down my throat, I 100% believe your life is your own and you should do what makes you happy as long as it doesn't hinder someone else's happiness. Dress however you like, whatever makes you comfortable but accept who you are.

I believe I can be myself, be a woman and not fit into our society's expectations of what it means to be a woman. I believe the same for a man. What makes them a man is XY chromosomes. While this comes across homophobic, I claim it is liberating!

I feel it is much better to accept who we are truly. Imagine a society that doesn't see you as less of a man for wearing makeup and tight fitting clothes, doesn't put you down for being sensitive or enjoying hobbies deemed 'feminine '. A society where woman can be seen as strong, brave without the negative connotation that go hand in hand with those words in our society, such as brass or bitch.

I met my (now ex) boyfriend about two months ago (Tinder date). We were immediately crazy about each other, we both said I love you on the first date and I thought that was really special and we moved in together after 3 weeks of seeing each other. I was living with my family previously to this and my grandma who needs constant care was being moved into the house so it seemed like perfect timing for me to move out and make space for her and my bf has a really nice place so everything felt really right. Anyway it's been a month and things were going really great, he was an amazing boyfriend, did lots of cooking, always rubbed my back for me (I have spasms). But today after he got back from getting gas he told me he ""didn't think this was working out"" and that I should ""find a way to move back in with my family"" (his words). I didn't expect this at all but according to him he had been struggling with it for a while and he says we're just too different but like I don't think so and I think there has to be some way I can make him realize that and go back to the last month which up until today was the happiest of my life?? And I can't go back home because there's no room for me since my grandma is there along w/ her helper people? I really have nowhere to go and he doesn't want me here anymore which is devastating by itself but also now I don't know where I am supposed to go.

 I asked him if I could have some time to stay with him and figure it out (that was my first response) and he told me he didn't feel comfortable with me ""in his space"" anymore (again, his words) and it was better if I just moved back home but he doesn't understand why that's not an option for me. Is there anything I can say to make him reconsider breaking up with me, I am having a hard time thinking straight, he is the only person besides my family I have ever lived with and I thought we were going to get married so I am pretty much in shock right now.

I'm sorry for the wall of text. This started as a letter to myself, a way to capture what I'm thinking and feeling. But I'm desperate enough to bring my most painful self to a score of strangers for judgment and hopefully insight. I hope I formatted this correctly.

For more than a year now, I’ve had no interest in sex. It’s as if the light switch of my libido has been flipped to off. At first, I didn’t question my lack of desire. Physical intimacy and I have a complicated relationship. To reach back and try to explain, I was raised conservatively. What does that mean? Well, I wasn’t allowed to wear pants, went to church several days a week, twice on Sunday, listened only to Christian music at home, performed daily Bible homework. Being homeschooled, it’s safe to say that I was raised in a bit of a fundamentalist bubble. Sex was a question mark, a thing both boys and men clearly wanted. 

I knew the mechanics in theory, as my mother thought to preempt the potential for sexual abuse and approached the topic when I was 4 and my brother 5. A pedophile had been caught with his nephew in our apartment complex, and she wanted us to have no confusion on what constituted sexual touch. We were free to ask any questions. Altogether I was grossed out and entirely uninterested. By that time, I’d already been exposed to the other sex when a young friend divested himself of clothing in the hot summer sun and when mother’s friend’s boy blocked me from leaving a room and offered me money to let him touch me. I handled both encounters with tears and shamed capitulation, respectively.

Another house in another town saw me avoiding the landlord’s 15 year old son at age 8. He would try to hold me tight in his lap and refuse to let go, would follow me into the woods to try and talk to me about vaginas, would catch one of our pets to return while wearing a towel that always seemed to fall off. I avoided his touch as best as I could, and I was terrified of what he would do should he ever catch me with no one around. I still despise that man.

What I knew for certain about the act of fornication was that it was meant only for a husband and a wife. The act was the wife’s duty, and it would result in a woman’s ultimate and final form: motherhood. I wanted nothing to do with any of it. 

At the start, I just assumed I could never have sex, being that I had no intention to marry. I lost my virginity at 18 in an act born of obligation and resignation. I had been with my boyfriend long enough that it was certainly his due. No one likes a tease, after all. Were I to experience rape, I did not want to be entirely uninformed on the procedure. Two birds, one cock.

Clearly, I did not have a healthy outlook. Over time, I embraced my sexual side. I experienced profound power and control when I ‘hunted’ for someone to fuck. I loved a challenge. I warned all potential partners that our time together was finite, and I had no interest in their love. 

Over time and after a tantric course I stumbled upon, my views softened. I tried to be healthier and more receptive. I found love. Then, I found heartbreak, betrayal and an abyss of sadness. 2018 was brutal. 2019 was difficult at the start. I spent most of the time on a couch that doubled as my bed, hiding from the world, stuck in a mire of misery.

One particularly rough day, I reached out to a friend and explained my state of mind and subsequent alcohol consumption. He invited me over and offered his home as a haven, where I could be sad in peace and good company. Not long after arriving, I sank to the hallway floor convulsing with sobs. He held me and brought several rounds of Kleenex. When I could speak again, he offered me more bourbon and drank with me. We talked, watched something I don’t remember, and everything goes black.

I woke in the morning naked in his bed. I was crushed. He sent me affectionate messages, cute cat pics. It was as if he was on Cloud 9, and I was scraping together a tattered semblance of self. Everything was confusion.

Weeks later we discussed ‘the event’, and I was honest. My state of mind, my obvious intoxication – I felt taken advantage of and did not know how to feel about him. He stared at me with sincere incredulity. He told me his side. As the evening progressed he became intoxicated. At some point I turned to him and asked, “are we going to do this or what?” with no doubt as to the implication of what “this” meant. He readily acquiesced. I gave him compliments on style and ability and thus, he lost his virginity. I did not know he was still a virgin at the time, as he presented otherwise.

I felt my broken parts grind against each other, my sense of self growing more diminished. He was telling the truth. Scattered bits of memory rose to the surface when he spoke. I did the only thing I could think to do and apologized. We moved on. We have been friends for years. We were both at fault. I stuffed everything into a corner of my mind and vowed to forget. 

We have begun dating. We had sex a few times at the beginning of the relationship. I tried to ‘get into it’, but I had no interest, just revulsion. I no longer feel that anyone is entitled to my body, so I explained my lack of desire. Of course, this was not his fault since my distaste of sex had been increasing for almost a year by now. I expressed the opinion that a sexless relationship was unhealthy and advised he look for a different partner. He staunchly refused and insisted he loved me and would not give up on a relationship for something so pithy as sex. To his credit, he does not push or insist and has asked questions to try and understand what might appeal to me instead.

I have been wondering why I reverted to my teenage self’s view of sex. It was a mental bone I would occasionally pick. Several days ago, something bubbled out in the recesses of my mind. I experienced an epiphany. Like a thunderbolt, I realized WHEN the appeal of sex began to taper off for me. How did I not see this sooner?

It is not easy to simply walk away. I hate him, and I hate myself. I pity him, and I pity myself. How could he? How could I? That he loves me is unquestionable. I don't know if I can ever reciprocate. I had offered several times over our friendship to take his virginity, to acquaint him with sex. He too had been homeschooled and raised conservatively. Originally, he wanted to wait for the right time but began to realize his beliefs had changed. I thought as friends, I could at least remove the burden he viewed his virginity. He had always declined while holding the door open for some potential future sexual foray. How, WHY did he pick that day to say yes?

I’ve booked the first available session with a therapist, but the appointment is several weeks away. I want to speak to them to better understand myself and be able to speak to him.

I(24f) have struggled with my weight since I was a child. At various points in my teens I was purging after every meal or going for days without eating until I would pass out. This started because when I was 12 I was moved from being homeschooled to going to a regular school. This was because my father passed away from heart disease in his mid 50s, something I firmly believe was at least partly my mother's fault. 

I was 12 and 198pounds. I was obese. I couldn't even walk up the 4 steps of our porch without needing to sit down. I was inevitably bullied relentlessly and was starving myself by the time I turned 13. I struggled to lose weight because of the incredibly unhealthy diet my mother gave my siblings and I as a child. When I was 14 my older brother(19 at the time) passed away after struggling with his weight for several years. 

After I left home I changed my life drastically. I'm now 5ft 9 and only 142 pounds, I'd like to be a little lighter but I'm considerably happier now than I used to be and also much fitter and I no longer feel like I have to go days without food or purge after eating. I went home for xmas and my mother spent most of boxing day pouring over childhood photo albums lamenting that I was such a twig now and what happened to her ""pretty little girl"" by mid afternoon and after asking her to stop repeatedly I blew up at her. 

I yelled that I had actually been obese and exceedingly unhealthy and that dad and my brother eat their way into early graves because of her shoveling unhealthy food into them. That fat wasn't pretty or cuddly it was unhealthy. She burst into tears and I left early. My younger brother(17m) has told me I'm being unfair and that she was struggling as a single mum and I should be more considerate and I told him he needed to lose weight or he would be in serious trouble later in life(hes 5ft 10 and over 290 pounds).

Sorry for the long read!

So im a 22f, engaged to a 25m. Currently we live with his parents as my family isn't the best to spend to much time with. He is the only one working out of both of us, as I have a broken wrist and thumb that aren't properly healing and I have to wait for surgery now. So that being said im a medical nightmare as we have found out. 

A bit of background to make the rest of this make sense. Prior to meeting my fiance, I had left an all around abusive ex (basically ive been through a lot of abusive, you name it i dealt with it). After leaving my ex my depression and anxiety got very bad to the point I didn't feel safe sleeping in another city. During that time I was diagnosed with PTSD, Stockholm syndrome, and they found out I had some broken bones due to the beating I got. I got some help with some issues, but for the most part I just focused on getting a job and working. In December 2019 I met my fiance and started dating. It was hard for both of us as I was scared of everything (him moving his hand sent me over edge) as I had not explained or told him what I had dealt with before, and for him I was his first girlfriend EVER! We learned things from each and grew close together. He had helped me overcome many obstacles and challenges i face due to my ex and ive helped him with his confidence, and health (hes diabetic and didn't really take care of it. I kick his butt if he ignores it now). In August 2020, he proposed and we got engaged. In October 2020 I moved in with him and his family due to family troubles on my side and they wanted help there so they asked me to help out. During the whole time we have been together I said I didn't want kids till I was 25 or 30 years old (Prior to dating him i got pregnant at 16, lost the child sadly and pregnant again by my ex at 19 but didn't work out) My fiance agreed and accepted this as he learned from my family what ive been through. In October of 2020 he brought up talking about us having kids and at that point I knew I wanted to be with him so I told him I dont mind having a family with you whenever, even if we choose now ( we didn't, we want to be financially ready and we need a new car.) 

So December rolls around and I start getting morning sickness and cramping a lot, he tells me not to worry and wait for my period but we buy the test then. I get my period and oh boy it was bad. I normally get if for 3 day and barely anything happens. NOPE. 9 days of hell and cramps, we almost went to the hospital It was that bad. So I ask my doctor about that and he informs me that it could be a loss. That I need to take a test and go from there. The test is negative, but still getting severe cramps, so he sends me for blood work and it shows I may have had a loss. So I become a blobbering mess for a week for multiple reasons. 
1. I messed up and should have taken the test when I was showing signs and not have waited.
2. I wanted to be a mother and was willing to talk and figure this out with him.
3. I was worried he would hate me for this and or for getting pregnant when we weren't planning on trying.

So flash forward to January 5, my doctor asks if the  cramp have stopped. Nope they are getting worse and I can't keep food down  at night. He thinks my body isn't accepting the loss and needs to be cleaned, but he wants more blood work done and an ultrasound. Had to fight to get those forms because he forgot to send them. But started talking to one of his nurses who pipes up and says ""with what you are going through now it doesn't sound like you loss the baby, it sounds like it just detached from one wall and moved to another. It happens and these are the effects of when they do happen, that's why he wants an ultrasound."" Still haven't been able to get the ultrasound done, and blood work apparently came back showing some worrying signs. 

so now after already having a break down of think I lost our baby. I'm now being told there is a slight chance it may still be there. I started crying again. But now we have to decide on so many options for us and maybe this child. 
Do we keep or put it up for adoption. Does some of the pain medication im on effect it, or can I be off of them without collapsing multiple times. Do we unfortunately have to let go of the idea of having children right now. 

In all of this my fiance is barely talking to me Bout this and changing the subject, his stance is till I get the surgery I need to fix my hand and wrist it would be our best option to not continue with it. And I understand where he's coming from and I respect his opinion but, hes not trying to hear me out. It feels like it's 1 sided here and I can barely get my voice in on it. He doesn't want his family other then his mother who helps me when I'm sick in the mornings knowing about this. He won't hear me out on maybe  talking about keeping it or maybe giving it up to a family who wants a child. During this whole thing ive been in twar day in and out, I cant hold or look at a baby right now as I fear it will bring me to tears. I dont know what it is but right now more then ever I just want him to hear me out on this, I want him to cry with me over our loss. I just want to know if he even cares. Yet he had been gaming with his friends online and ignoring this conversation. 

This is a big life changing topic and I just feel lost. Can I please get some advice. PLEASE NO RUDE OR IGNORANT COMMENTS as this really isn't the time for them. I just want advice or tips on how to talk about this and maybe suggest on who else I could talk to about this as I feel alone.

I’ll call her O. We matched on Hinge, and her first message to me was really sweet and we basically hit it off. It was at the end of last semester, and it turns out O had a rough one so she wanted to spend some time with her family. 

I’m totally cool with this, “spend all of the time with your family,” and I asked her out on walk/date after the holidays sometime. She seemed genuinely pleased with this and we didn’t talk for a few weeks. I didn’t reach out again until I spilled the beans to my brother and my best friend to which they replied, “TEXT HER YOU DUMMY.” I’m paraphrasing, but you get it...

I dropped O a little, “hey just thinkin bout ya,” text and she responded with some very good vibes. Very quickly, it’s like we had never stopped texting. No weirdness, laughing, flirting, whole nine yards. Haven’t felt this cute in years, ngl. And damn was she being cute back! Pulling at my heart. Ugh. New Years goes by, and this keeps going right on through it and we just keep getting cuter and more bold as the days go by. 

Then we start getting a little heavy. Back and forth and she wants to send me a pic. 

Fucking, s c o r e.  

She’s a smoke show. Seriously, jaw drop and everything, and I can’t help but start painting her in my head. O accidentally falls asleep later that night, but you won’t hear anything from me because I got an apology the next morning for it. 

That apology happened Friday, and we were texting about that walk a bit more seriously too. I asked if she would be free for a phone conversation later that night, and she sends me a kissy face emoji and a “I’ll call you later.” I’m floored. She’s into me. 

My hearts racing waiting for the call, can’t help but re-read our conversation from the night before. Hours roll by with no call, and then it’s midnight. Hm... 

I never texted her back that night to remind her, maybe that’s my bad, so I decided to say, “hey no biggie, if you didn’t want talk on the phone ya coulda just said so.” Wink emoji with an ‘lol.’ Ya know, keeping it light. Not trying to prosecute em for forgetting about me, just being friendly. 

No reply. It says it’s been delivered (we both have iMessage) but she’s never had her read receipts on, so I don’t know if or when she read it. 

It’s now Monday, technically, and I resisted to reach out all Sunday in hopes she would notice. Alas, here I type. 

Should I try to push a little more? What would I say?? Do I just drop it and move on and let what I thought we had die with that? Or maybe I go all out and figure some way to reach out to her friends so I can send her an edible arrangement?

I’m fairly positive she’s who she says she is. I don’t have any personal social media, so there’s no way for me to look her up on there if I wanted to. She’s shown me artwork, selfies from various angles, and as far as I can tell she has a beaming smile and two cheeks that are dying to get smothered in kisses. 

Tl;dr: Two cute early twenty somethings being cute for a while over text. I ask to talk on the phone, suddenly the one who isn’t me turns into a ghost. So because of the cuteness, I can’t convince myself that she has stopped liking me, and I don’t want to be a pest trying to figure it out at risk of pushing her away. Advice?

They're just casually homophobic around me.. gagging at shows that show gay people and boycotting any shows they previously liked because a character turned out to be gay. They constantly tell me how much I cost (in terms of time and money) what they do for me, it gives me anxiety and I asked them to please stop but they said they're preparing me for the harsh realities of this world. My birthday is coming up and I'm worried, I know anything they do for me they'll use against me so I've tried to keep quiet.

They tell me that I'm a failure no matter what I do (getting into honors programs or college prep) and I'm worried as I am getting closer to 18 and.. if I don't have my life together it'll be non-stop lecturing and shaming and I'm not sure if I can live like that.

Old habits die hard I guess.

edit2: My parents do have me medicated, going to therapists, and going through treatments and I have an IEP. In terms of how they're handling my disabilities, they are doing a lot more than other parents would and I'm thankful for that. But I have a feeling they might have some toxic tendencies.

edit3: The homophobic behavior mostly comes from my dad, my mom has been pretty tolerant except the occasional comment here and there. But the rest of the things they both do.

This has some backstory. I (16F) dated my ex (16M) for about 1 year and a half. July 7,2019 - October 30, 2020 (or something like that). It was a very difficult and stressful relationship for me but i did truly love him. Blindly, sometimes. 

We hit it off first as strangers, then friends with benefits, then we started dating. It was great! Infatuation and all that, but a few months in we started fighting. It was all random fights, nothing serious. We were getting to know each other and learning how to work with each other’s personality and ideals. We fought A LOT but I tried my best to work through it. We had good days and bad days like any relationship but it was more bad than good and I was the only one trying to communicate. He’d usually just run away to his friends house and get angry if I tried to message him. Any time I brought up something that bothered me he’d ignore me until I dropped it. (He once ignored me for about a week after a disagreement, I had to show up to his house with his stuff just to hear him tell me “oh i didn’t break up with you”) Before you say it, I know, I should’ve gotten to know him first.

A few months later, maybe a few days after my birthday in April, I get a text from his ex. She’s a sweetheart and I hold no grudge against her. My boyfriend (now ex) apparently texted her saying he had feelings for her. I was on a call with him (we were laughing and talking) when she texted me and apparently he was texting her while talking to me. I was heartbroken. I ended the call and just cried. It was all fake smiles. I wanted to leave him so badly and I did! But he just let me leave. I wanted him to want me to stay.. I texted him a few hours after that and we got into an argument (again). I ended up apologizing for not being a good enough girlfriend and we started the relationship again. 

It was all paranoia after that. I was paranoid but I just wanted to make him happy. Every time we got into fights I’d just give up. He’d start yelling and me and blocking me on everything. I was so attached that I put it off as normal. It hurt. So much. A few months later he starts acting “better”. We’re communicating and acting like a real couple should. Then it comes suddenly that he wants to break it off. For good. I was heartbroken, begging, crying, but he was set on his decision. He didn’t want to be friends either.

I’ll admit, I should’ve just worked on myself after that, but I wanted to feel loved.. so I had a rebound. It was some random guy I met a few days later and we were just having fun. 

My ex saw this guy on my story and starting criticizing me. “Oh you’re with this guy now” “Oh I meant nothing to you” and I was done with, but the breakup was really recent so it STILL HURT. He finally stops getting mad at me and tells me how he “realized how much I meant to him”. I’m so confused now. 

It’s been a few months since the breakup and him(ex) and I are still talking. We’ve gotten “closer” but we aren’t dating. He’s acting like the person I’ve always expected he would someday be “if I just stayed” and he wants to get back together. I love him, I do, and sometimes I do believe we can do it but.. That relationship broke me. It put me into lows that I’ve never been in before. He tells me he’s changed and he’s really acting like it but it’s only been a few months.

Short backstory: My (26m) girlfriend ""Lucy"" (24f) and I have been together for a little over 3 years now. She has struggled with anxiety and depression when she was a teenager but she has been mostly fine for the last 5 years or so. I don't wanna go too deep here but she has been a little worse the last few months due to the general situation with Corona, her work-situation (she really hates her job) and she's had some medical issues in the last 2 weeks that had her in quite a bit of pain, and has only been getting a little better since yesterday or so. So her mental health wasn't at its best to begin with. 

This morning we had a very minor argument, nothing tragic at ALL but it somehow caused her to have a mental breakdown unlike anything I've experienced so far in our relationship. She has been in the bedroom for around 8 hours now, so literally all day, only coming out to use the bathroom. She has been crying for hours this morning and I did go and try to check on her twice, both times she wouldn't say a word and only shrugged her shoulders when I asked her how I could help her/what she needs me to do.
Later in the day I brought her a little something to eat. Other than that I left her alone because I wanted to give her space to go through whatever she's going through. I have experiences with depression and anxiety myself and while I admittetley haven't gone through an epsiode this severe in years I do remember that I always wanted to be left alone in situations like that so I assumed I was doing the right thing by leaving Lucy alone until she was ready to face the world again. 

It's evening now in my country and she did come out to help me cook but I told her I'd handle it so she doesn't have to do it since she's not feeling fine. Somehow that caused her to tear up again a little and she went back to the bedroom. 

I just got off the phone with my mom and I mentioned Lucys state of mind and my mom basically said I'm the asshole for not trying to pursue her and get her to open up or at least spend a little time with her, even if I'm just sitting next to her, not talking or anything so she knows I'm (literally) there for her. I'd like to assume that Lucy is well aware that I AM here for her whenever she wants to talk and I've never seen her in a state like this before so I don't know the best way to handle her and she is apparently still not ready to talk so I'm still at a loss of what to do.

All I really know about her is she broke my boyfriends heart like two years ago. Apparently she cheated on him and left him for someone closer to her hometown, but my boyfriend admits he treated her pretty terribly throughout the relationship so I’m not sure how much I fully understand the situation. 

She is closer to his age so when he first told me about her I spent a few weeks just checking her profiles out etc because I did feel insecure and she is pretty. I always wondered if she hadn’t done what she did, would they still be together? Probably, because apparently it took him a while to get over her. I’ve been with my boyfriend a year now so for the past few months I honestly hadn’t been giving her any thought. 

My boyfriend has been trying Twitch out but tbh it isn’t going too well for him. He’s not gaining viewers or followers so he’s semi given up on it. But he still watches quite a bit of it, and I noticed when he searched for a name, his girlfriends Twitch account popped up. I know it’s hers because when I found her Twitter she has it linked there. I know I was a weirdo for “stalking” her for the first few weeks but I honestly was just a bit insecure. I’m honestly over it now, or I was, but at the beginning he didn’t do much to reassure me and talked about her highly so I have to admit I was curious about her and decided to check her social media out. I haven’t been on it in over six months though. 

So when he went to the bathroom I checked his history and found out he’s actively still watching her on Twitch. As far as I can see he doesn’t watch while she’s live, but he watches the videos afterwards. Wtf?! This has honestly really hurt me because I don’t understand why he would still be watching his ex on Twitch. Especially when he used to talk about her as the one that got away. It makes me feel like he potentially still has feelings for her because he’s been on her page like every night for the past three months (that’s how far the history goes). 

I’m not sure if to confront him about it. We don’t live together but I do stay over often, and he’s careful not to open her page whilst I’m here, but now I know he’s watching her whilst I’m gone and I’m really upset about it. I really don’t want him watching her streams. I’m not sure how long he stays on there because it doesnt show, but either way I’m frustrated. He shouldn’t be checking her page at all?! They broke up over two years ago. 

Do you think I should confront him and ask why he’s still watching her? I understand he may just enjoy her content, but that’s strange to me and I don’t like it. Her channel is doing pretty well as far as I can tell so he might be looking for inspiration. But he doesn’t need to be on her channel every night for that...

Please give me some advice.

PREVIOUS POST- My boyfriend hit me yesterday and I haven't talked to him since then but I was just hanging out with my life long friend(He was there when it happened and him and my boyfriend got into a fight which my friend won because martial arts is a thing so yeah) anyway I was with my friend and shit happened between us(I'm 17 so I was a virgin before this) and I feel like I should feel bad about it or have regrets or something but I don't and I don't know why I know what I did was wrong but my friend keeps telling me it's not my fault but I know it is because I'm the one that made the first move so I don't know why I feel no guilt or anything

NEW- I ended up dumping my boyfriend so I'm single now, anyways I have another problem... I think I have feelings for my friend like I'm basically 100% sure but I don't know if he feels the same, also my parents are really protective and my friend is 19(I'm 17 meaning he's an adult and I'm a minor) so I don't know if they would be ok with that but even if that's what I want I don't know how to bring it up to him and I don't know how to tell him how I feel and what I want

Up until about a year ago I always had a high sex drive it was normal for me to want sex atleast daily. However over the past year or so I have gone to having almost zero interest in it ever. My husband still has a very high sex drive and thigh he's understanding and would never force or pressure me, I feel bad that I no longer enjoy that form of intimacy. I'm almost never in the mood so when I do end up forcing myself into something sexual I don't enjoy it because I can't mentally get into it. I do not blame my husband we have a good marriage and he's an amazing person but I'm starting to feel guilty for not satisfying him sexually enough. Not only that but I WANT to want sex again. It's like how one enjoys their favorite foods because of how good they taste then suddenly losing all sense of taste so you're just apathetic towards food (this is my best way of relating how I feel about my low sex drive). It does frustrate me because a whole part of life I used to enjoy now gives me no pleasure to think about anymore. 

The advice I'm asking here is are there any possible supplements that could help with this? I'm not sure what's wrong with me exactly, my husband thinks it's early menopause which I do have many symptoms of but I still have periods although they have gotten heavier over the last year. I also went to a doctor to have blood work done last year to see if I was in menopause or had hormonal insurances but everything seemed to come back normal. I would like to add I do take care of myself, I eat healthy and get excersise, I'm not overweight or have any physical health issues. I also don't feel depressed generally just apathetic about some things. Mentally I'm overall content with life just annoyed more easily these days.

She asked why I wanted this and if something had happened and I told her about the bullying. Since then my mother feels awful about it and feels awful that she didn't know about it. She asked me why I didn't told her about it and I told her that I did but after a while stopped because it didn't make a difference if I talked about it or not. She said that she couldn't have helped me because I didn't told her ( even though I did in the first 2 years) and know after every therapy session she asks me if I talked about her and if told my therapist about her. 
She asked me many times if she done something wrong and she didn't stop if I tell her no. If I say that there's something that I wish she would do a bit different she gets angry. I feel like she feels guilty about the bullying but lets it out on me.
So am I the asshole in this situation? Was it bad from me to stop telling her about it ?

Edit/update: I talked with my mom again to finally sort things out and it went well. She promised to stop and I think ( and hope) that she will keep this promise.

I'll keep this as concise as possible, but if more info is needed I will answer questions in the comments.


I'm 44F a mom of four kids, Joe 16M, John 15M, Jackie 13F, and Janice 11F. My husband Jake 48M and I make a comfortable living, our children don't go without but they are thankful for what they do have.


Jake is into console games, which our kids also enjoy. Joe and John have consoles in their room (they each received a PS4 for Christmas, and John was excited to buy some new games with his Christmas money). We do allow them to play games like GTA but limit their time and they understand very well that they're just games and not to be emulated.


My sister (Tina 40F) has two kids Mike 15M and Molly 14F. She's a single mom and isn't home often due to work so sometimes my niece and nephew took advantage. For example Mike was grounded over Christmas break for sneaking beer into the house, and Molly is grounded for being caught having sex with her boyfriend last week.


Because of this, my retired mom became their after school babysitter. This began after Molly was caught last week. Ever since, Tina has gone into overdrive looking for something to blame for their behavior.



Here's the situation.


John loaned a few of his games to Mike. Tina found them while snooping through her kids rooms and became furious! She decided to take all of their consoles and games when they were at school and sold EVERYTHING, including John's games.


Mike called me up in a panic two days ago and told me what she did. John had texted him about the games the night before, but he didn't know what to tell him because he had already told Tina that they weren't all his games but she didn't care because they were rubbish! I immediately told Mike that it wasn't his fault, and I would handle this.


I called Tina that night when I knew she would be home, and I told her that I know she sold all of the games in Mike's room and asked her to pay back for the ones that were John's. She told me that children shouldn't be playing such filth and wasn't giving us a cent. I told her that John bought them with his money and I don't care how she punishes her kids, but she is not punishing mine.



She began crying and accused me of calling her a bad mother, yelled at me to go fuck myself, then she handed the phone to our mom who scolded me and told me my kids shouldn't be playing those games in the first place because my niece and nephew probably picked up their attitudes from those video games!


I snapped that my kids respect me and I would NEVER sell their personal property. I wanted the money for MY SON'S games and nothing else. She said ""grow up Gina, you're not a single mom"" and hung up on me.


I told Jake about all this and he agrees that Tina should have offered to replace the games, but he thinks that I was an asshole for asking when she's a single mom and doesn't make much money.

sorry for this long post. it didn't take long to make so don't feel obligated to respond.

this girl and I got close in the beginning of 2020, got extemely close.

she finally rejected me in june 2020. saying i was never anything more than just a friend but that she had known my intention since the very beginning. and she had been acting VERY into me for these months. idk if she lied about her feelings or was using me for attention.

but she pushed for me to stay friends with her, after some convincing, i agreed. i also remember she got mad at me when i first said i wasn't gonna stay friends. (mad in a positive way, like she pushed more for me to stay)

we kinda grew apart, we didn't text everyday like we used to, she didn't send me cute pics anymore, we flirted less through text but still A LOT in real life. once through text, she invited me to come over to her house but then backed out of it, it was like midnight, we were playfully arguing and i said that i could easily beat her up if i wanted to, she replied saying that I couldn't or whatever and then basically told me to come over with lots of winky faces. but then she backed out.

in real life, sometimes we were VERY flirty, sometimes we were normal. but we were always around each other and we frequently acted like a couple, many guys asked me if me and her were dating, she was always around me when they asked, i always just said ""nope"" and she never responded. she would just stand there.

she generally made more effort to talk to me than i did to her. and we were always sitting near each other in class. (even tho her bff is also in the class)

but then, a couple months ago i invited her to go eat out AS A GROUP, but i didn't mention the group part. so it lead to me getting rejected again. i replied saying that yes i was still into her but that i wasn't hitting on her/trying to make moves on her anymore.

it was maybe cold from my part, because her rejection was very nice, she said she didnt want to hurt me, waste my time or give me false hope. but i don't think what i said was mean or enough for her to get pissed at me.

my messages PISSED her off. she instantly got mad, started ignoring me, avoided me EVERYWHERE, changed seats in EVERY class to get away from me, etc...

but i would see her stare at me, and the first time i tried talking to her, she got teary eyes while ignoring me. she very obviously had one thing on her mind, at that thing was me. she was visibly sad or not being herself.

school break happens, 3 weeks go by. no contact at all. (keep in mind, i never apologized)

when school starts back up, she started showing subtle (not so subtle) signs of wanting to talk. basically everything a shy girl would do to try and get a guys attention. staring, laughing at anything I say, ""accidentally"" touching me, etc... (MANY more signs)

and she came back to ALL her seats near me in class.

i ignored all her signs. after 1 month of ignoring her signs, so 2 months of not talking in total.

i texted her for her birthday, a friendly message saying ""happy bday"" and ""I hope you have a nice day""

she replied with ""thanks a lot, you too"" and then a minute later she sent me 2 winky faces.

she very obviously wants to talk to me, but is she into me or trying to play with my feelings ?

i don't know what to do.

Im (21M) and a junior in college and have been 3 months in a relationship with a girl who is extremely wonderful (21F). She is very beautiful, we have insane chemistry sexually, we have the same humor, watch the same shows together, read together, both like to travel and try new things, we both are introverted, we like the same foods, the same music, ect….. I mean I always say that she is me but basically girl form. She has been the best girlfriend I have ever been with and our communication is unparalleled coupled with her understanding and empathy for anything I may need being perfect. Weirdly enough I find that I have been creating my own problems for a relationship that has had none prior. Also our trust is completely mutual and I am always conscientious of making sure I don’t do stuff that makes her too uncomfortable and same with her. She also feels like a best friend at times as well which kind of fucks with my head because we have known each other for 3 months and have formed such a deep bond.

My dating experience before the relationship I am in now has been a chase for people who aren't entirely that much similar to me, or didn’t want what I was looking for. I prefer a connection with someone over the hookup culture stuff, but I left myself open to become vulnerable quickly, and when the people who I was with before cut me off suddenly it hurt a bit. This chase made it so if I ever got a little bit of what I wanted (what I romanticized about) I would feel that euphoric experience with the girl. Even if it was one date for the week it was exciting and I would think of my next opportunity to get another hit of the excitement. But alas my excitement blinded me to the truth that these flings were not going to work out.

I came back to college this year with no intention of dating but then I met this girl and I just had to be with her. This is where the new learning curve appeared. Due to her and I being the same we spent almost all our time at school together, this is also because of COVID and not being able to see/do as many of the other normal things we were used to. I eventually got a little tired of her and noticed I didn’t feel like myself and started asking questions like ""maybe I don’t like her"" ""maybe I am lying to myself that I like her"". These thoughts became ruminations and made me anxious around her sometimes, or when she shared her feelings I felt guilty almost like I was lying to make sure I didn’t kill the mood which sucked. It did not make sense why any of this was happening because I recognize that she is really a special catch and really appreciated every aspect of me, even my flaws. Eventually we went home for break and I could think about everything in isolation, but the anxiety got so bad that I just wanted to sleep and not do anything for a week or so. I found out about ROCD and the symptoms I experienced were almost identical but I have never been diagnosed with OCD in my life. Intrusive thoughts of considering breaking up with her, or ""imagining myself breaking up with her and feeling nothing"" didn’t help either. I have felt a lot better since that episode and have spent the past 10 days with her non-stop over break and have enjoyed my time with her, but I can't always help but notice I am not as infatuated as I had been in the past with other relationships and early on in ours. My thinking is that it is because I burnt through that early phase quick because of how much time I spent with her, and my questioning killed it more probs. I feel as if I am in the commitment phase now, but sometimes my mind sneaks into ruminating about the relationships and my feelings because this is a new experience. I am very comfortable with my relationship and don’t have to put so much work in to make stuff happen, it just all goes smoothly on its own. I also freak myself out a little when I'm not missing her which is kind of dumb.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long read, is what I am experiencing normal because I never thought such a perfect partner would cause so much distress in my mind hahahaha, hate myself for the hole I dug but oops, guess I had to learn about this side of adult relationships eventually, it ant always gunna be like Hollywood!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have just been going along with things and not letting the anxiousness I created for myself ruin this wonderful thing I have. I even went to see a therapist because I wanted clarity on this issue and journaling.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

She mentioned how different our relationship felt to her also and how there was the layer of being really good friends which made me feel better because that new sensation wasn't only felt on one side.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As you see above I recognize all that is going on and recognize the situation pretty well, but I cant stop myself from going back to the questions. If I ever feel a little confused, or even something like being hangry at her will plant that seed again and will make me want to come to reddit or the internet for comfort since it is reassuring.

Thanks again guys.

We usually don't discuss about our boyfriends or girlfriends because it makes both of us uncomfortable. But this time she outrightly texted me that she's single.

Context:
We're best friends from college with amazing compatibility and used to hangout all the time. She's the only person who's opinions - contrary to mine - get my respect and more often than not I'm persuaded otherwise. That's amazing. We can go at a length talking 8 hrs straight for anything under the sun and not get bored.

We both graduated this year and are living in different cities but for some reason at least I don't feel the distance. We both work in high pressure jobs and talking sometimes becomes tough. So on our last call, which was after 4 months of no talk because I was pissed at her (for not replying to some dumb messages of mine, dick me), I started asking about her life updates, parents etc. This is when I touched that uncomfortable (god, heartbreaking) topic about her relationship. She outrightly deflected that question and I got the hint to change the topic.

Two weeks later out of no where she texts me that, she thinks I should know something. With pulse rate sky high I waited for her to reply. This is when she mentions that she's not dating anymore and she was uncomfortable to talk about it earlier on call. Cloud number 9!

Extremely confused &amp; happy me inquires if she's okay and quickly changes the topic. Back of the mind I have a battery of questions being fired and this is where I need help:

1. How much time do I have before she finds someone new? How do I get data on this time frame?

2. When is the right time to let her know of my feelings?

3. Given the long distance, what all can I do to persuade her?

Constraints: She's my best friend and I don't wanna lose her in this quest.

God, this is what it means to be smitten! 😅

I was happier digesting the fact that she's with someone than contemplating the worst case scenario of today - she finds someone new and I've lost my shot at her. When I first fell for her, she was already with someone.

We own a dog together and we live in a major city. We live a couple of blocks away from a cemetery and about a fifteen minute walk away from a park.

The boost formula has been refined to perfection, removing the need to use the trick system from Sonic Rush and instead, keeping the flow intact by having the boost gauge filled with wisps and breaking badniks. Because of this, the level design has also been improved greatly.

No longer are there bottomless pits in every single stage (cough, Sonic Rush, cough), stages are longer and are designed like a classic Sonic game, with a healthy balance between speed, exploration, and combat. Sonic's moveset has been expanded to perfection, having the boost, spin-dash, stomp, slide, and the homing attack- everything the blue hedgehog needs to blaze through levels.

The physics have been improved from Sonic rush as well, as Sonic's spin-dash actually moves with real momentum and there aren't many instances of running through a loop at low speeds. This makes his movement feel natural and weighty and much more responsive than ever before. His acceleration is a bit fast but still very smooth. The only thing I would complain about is that Sonic stops on a dime, other than that no problems here.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the levels and their respective aesthetics and gimmicks work better for 2D than in 3D. (Tropical Resort, Aquarium Park, Planet Wisp, and Asteroid Coaster are my favorites.) The music is remade in the DS soundfont, which is a little lesser quality for some songs, (Terminal Velocity, Planet Wisp, and Aquarium Park) But IMO it enhances others: (Asteroid Coaster, Sweet Mountain, the Final Boss)

The DS version doesn't have fully animated cutscenes with voice acting like the Wii version, but it makes up for this by keeping SOME of them and also featuring other characters like Shadow, Knuckles, Amy, Silver, etc.

In my opinion, the lineup of wisps is better because there aren't as many in the Wii version. (Only 5 in the DS version, 9 in the Wii version) they are utilized much better as well, because many stages use many of the same wisps and that allows for a lot of exploration on how to use them.

Lastly, the final boss is easily my favorite in any Sonic DS game (both the Egg-Nega Wisp and the Mother Wisp) The use of wisp powers in the Egg-Nega Wisp fight is really simplistic but very fun to play.

The problems with our relationship were small annoyances before, but have since escalated to something I am afraid could be dangerous. 

After the death of a close friend, we started drinking more frequently in October. This peaked on Halloween, as my husband had a toothache that interfered with his entire day. I volunteered to be DD so he could take a couple shots to ease the pain, and we could take our 4 year old son trick or treating in a more covid-safe neighborhood where some friends lived for the night. This gave my husband, who has always been a ""give an inch, take a mile"" type of guy, complete permission to drink heavily. He continued drinking long into the night, after I put our son to sleep and had gone to bed myself. The next morning, I tried to wake him up and was shocked to find half a liter of vodka had disappeared. Worried for his safety, my attempts to wake him became more frantic. Eventually I splashed water on his face. He ""woke up"" in a still blacked out state and assaulted me by kicking me in the chest, pushing me into a door frame, and punching me in the head. Luckily, our son was in the other room eating and had no idea. I had to use a 5 lb weight lying around to hit his arm enough to escape from his grasp. I am now traumatized by this event. He has never so much as called me a foul word in the past. After gathering some things and leaving the house with the kiddo for a couple hours, I returned to speak with my husband about what happened. I had taken pictures as proof, in case he thought I was exaggerating. He completely broke down sobbing and apologizing, not remembering anything of it. He poured all alcohol down the drain and hasn't had a drop since. I recognize that his actions were possibly a result of CPTSD that has gone untreated (he was sexually assaulted by a family member for years of his childhood). 

I put some boundaries in place that if he ever 1. lays a hand on me or our son in anger, 2. drinks alcohol, and 3. does not get himself some treatment (therapy, counseling, psychiatry, etc.) I will leave him and take our son to live with his grandparents. 

So, he got into therapy. He is now on antidepressants and his mood has been much better. I got my own therapist as well. (Thankfully I have healthcare that covers most of the bill so we are able to afford this for the time being. ) and I have been doing EMDR to recover from this as well as past trauma. 

Then, a month later, I am doing laundry and I spot his wallet in the underwear drawer. This is an unusual place for him to keep his wallet, as he generally leaves it about wherever. I am not one to snoop into his personal belongings, but I knew this was hidden specifically. Inside I find a rolled up dollar bill and a small baggie with white residue. It's cocaine. I know this. He has had a problem in the past, before we got together, but cleaned it up before we met. I had seen him do it at parties when we were dating, and had tried it myself a few times. I didn't like it, but at the time it seemed relatively harmless. But the way he behaved about it was different than myself. I brushed it off as he wasn't one to do it by himself, or at our house. Once I got pregnant with our son, I had an agreement that this was not something we would allow in our house, and would not be partaking in as long as we had a person's life in our hands. The risks were too high for addiction, legal trouble, and all around bad parenting. It turns out for the past 5 years he has been doing it at work without anyone's knowledge. Taking money from our shared bank account at times when I would not notice, and lying to me about it. After being found out, he emotionally manipulated me by begging and crying, and physically blocked me from leaving the house. He changed his phone number the next day, so that his dealers could not contact him. He had never saved any of their numbers, as a way to keep me from finding out. 

Now I feel less safe, less trusting, and very insecure about our relationship. He is a gentle giant, with a big heart, and a great dad. At least I thought he was. We just bought a house in 2020 and were finally getting into some kind of routine. We have always been great at communication and parenting styles. The biggest issues before now were his inability to be an adult about some things: waking himself up for work/important appointments/watching our toddler, doing household things without being asked, eating at regular times and healthy foods, a porn addiction for a couple years, all around not being proactive and responsible. I have anxiety so some of this I thought was just me having overly high expectations, but now I am beginning to wonder if I have been mothering and codependency-ing an addiction for all of these years. 

Recently he has been missing his therapy appointments and sleeping in again. I find this very triggering and am wondering if these are red flags that I need to leave to give my son a better life, or if these sound more like temporary bumps in the road we can overcome?  

TLDR: my husband got really drunk and put hands on me, then a month later I find he has been hiding a cocaine addiction for our entire relationship. Steps have been taken to make positive change but is it too little too late?

Hold your horses now, this isn't some diatribe about bringing back a Khmer Rouge, Year Zero style revolution.

Lots of the book examines Khmer/Cambodian society and how/why it works the way it does.

The great Angkor civilisation (builders of Angkor Wat) were so successful because they used irrigation to grow rice 3/4 times a year (rather than being locked into one seasonal harvest). The 20th century Cambodians pre Khmer Rouge revolution had regressed to just once per year. Leading colonists to deride them as 'lazy'

A famous phrase went 'The Vietnamese grow the rice, the Cambodians watch it grow, the Laotians listen to it grow'.

So, onto our main story. An American entrepreneur visited Cambodia post overthrow of Pol Pot to teach farming techniques to farmers who were still using quite medieval methods right until the 80s/90s. Using machinery, fertilizer and pesticides they were able to double their rice yields. Let's say from 40 tonnes to 80 tonnes. The Khmers were ecstatic. 

2 years later the American entrepreneur returned, to find the farmers were continuing you use his methods. However, they were now only working half as much land as they had before he'd instructed them. They had chosen to use the gift of efficiency to cut their work by 50%, continuing to grow 40 tonnes of rice, whilst only working half the land.

Short, the writer, tells this story as a sort of 'gotcha' moment, to illustrate that this society is in fact more concerned with leisure than work. Although he does concede that it's also due to essentially people being happy with what they have and what they need, rather than striving for 'more and more'.

I think the story has some pretty big lessons for us too. Over the last 30/40 years we've developed incredible technologies that have cut the time it takes to do things in half, or more! And yet, we continue to work (or be forced to work) a 9-5pm schedule, if not more. Working hours are going up, rather than down. Clearly we are doing more work/achieving more/producing more.

Yet, we are not earning double/triple what we were in the past. In fact, we've gone from a scenario where one breadwinner was able to provide for a family with children on a sole income, to working couples struggling to combine their incomes to cover the bare essentials, while home ownership and having children remain a distant dream or a seriously stress inducing risk.


TL;DR - Cambodian farmers worked out a way to do half as much work, while producing an equal quantity of product. Giving them more leisure and the same amount of wealth. Our society demands that we work more, produce more, while rewarding us with less and tying our happiness to greed.",0,0,antiwork,t5_2y77d,self,An interesting story about work and priorities...,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/l2fqsx/an_interesting_story_about_work_and_priorities/,all_ads,7.0

I probably could have worded it more eloquently to him but I’ve been really annoyed with my dad lately.

I didn't think I would have to come to Reddit for advice, but here we are! I'll try to keep it fairly short and sweet, but will include some backstory to add context.

My girlfriend and I have been together in a relationship for about a year now, meeting in September 2019, but not really calling anything official until about January of 2020. Shortly after, I moved interstate to a new city to start a new job, and we both decided to remain in contact and try out a long distance sort of arrangement with the occasional visit to see whether we wanted to pursue things long term. COVID made short work of our long distance plans - she lost her job in her home city and was running out of money in a matter of weeks, and on top of the threat of eviction from her house looming, she had absolutely no support network to speak of. The best option for both of us at that stage was for her to move interstate and relocate to where I am now working so I could support her financially, and while this initially was intended to be a temporary measure as I felt moving in together was a little premature, we ended up not wanting to separate, so she stayed.

The living circumstances admittedly haven't been perfect for my partner. I make what would be considered a median full time wage and can not afford to rent my own house, so when I relocated to this city in early 2020, I moved into a shared 4 bedroom house with a couple of other residents already living here. This was fine for me personally, and surprisingly enough I was fast friends with my housemates, one of them a male in his early 30s (we'll call him ""A"") and the other a female in her mid 30s (for reference, ""E""). In a matter of months (before my partner moved from her old home) the three of us housemates were thick as thieves, particularly myself and E. My routine gradually became a consistent ritual of coming home from work, cooking dinner, sitting with my housemates for an hour or two chatting, eventually heading off for some video chat time with my girlfriend who at this point remained in interstate before going to sleep. Life was fulfilling and with the prospect of semi-regular visits to/from my girlfriend on weekends, everything seemed right in the world, provided we had an eventual goal to reunite and make more permanent arrangements in either city.

Come COVID lockdowns, my partner moves in with me with the consent of both A and E considering the nature of the circumstances. My partner however is an extreme introvert, and for the first month of living with me, rarely ventured from my room. As such, she socialised very little with A and E, and often wouldn't even speak beyond a basic greeting. That's okay, not everyone gets along... and there was never any enmity at all between them, so little harm done I guess. Both A and E had no qualms with how my partner was and I continued to socialise with them as normal, spending an hour or so a day out in the living area chatting as always, while later heading off to my room to spend the rest of the night with my girlfriend.

This is where the issues begin. E and myself got along like a house on fire, and I really enjoyed spending time with her (in a purely platonic sense of course). However, my girlfriend started to feel that because of the closeness of my friendship with E, there was something a little more than just friendship involved. This was not and never has been the case. In the weeks after my girlfriend moving in, she got progressively colder and quieter until one day she finally spilled her concerns, explaining that me spending as much time as I did with E made her feel extremely jealous. And look... to be 100% honest, my response could have been a little more mature. I did try my best to reassure her that there was nothing between us, but my girlfriend requested that I spend a ""minimal"" amount of time associating with E because it made her feel jealous. Admittedly I felt a bit offended and upset because a) I felt that she didn't trust me to do the right thing, and b) I valued my friendship with E and didn't exactly want that to be damaged, and c) I never conversed with E to the exclusion of my partner, she was more than welcome to come and join the rest of us (at first I encouraged her to, but didn't force her, she is VERY much the introvert). In retrospect I could have been more mature in my response, and to begin with I didn't really want to have to ""cut the time"" I spent with my housemates come friends to appease my girlfriend. Her request did not go unheeded though and I was a little more cautious in how my interactions with my housemates (E in particular) went from that point forward.

Fast forward a month or two later, and my girlfriend is still rather jealous of the now limited time I spend chatting with E. She claims that I still ""greeted E in such a way as to 'twist the jealousy knife'"", as she still felt extremely jealous over E. Once again this ended up in a bit of a spat and we had an argument over it. Once again, I further amended the way I act. I now barely speak to E, and speak substantially less with A (though A isn't really an issue for my partner given that he's male). I'm starting to feel just a little bit isolated, but my girlfriend is beginning to feel more positively about things which I am happy for. At one stage I'm begrudgingly permitted to go and assist E in buying a car for a few hours with some friends of hers, which seems like a big step for my girlfriend and I began to think that maybe she had finally realised there's nothing more than a platonic friendship between us.

Fast forward a month or so later. A and E invite me and by extension my girlfriend to go to the beach with them for the day. I'm stoked, absolutely keen as a bean, the weather is peaking and I couldn't think of anything better to do with the day. I break this to my partner, saying that I would like to go along... and it turns into an explosion of tears and sobbing on her end because she still up to this point has unresolved jealousy issues over E and feels that she is traumatised because I was spending an excessive amount of time sitting out in the living room socialising, when she first moved in. Despite the continual amendment of just how much time I associate with E, the issues that my partner has haven't really seemed to lessen at all, unlike what I thought when I was given leave to assist with the car purchase with very little protest. I was a little disheartened, and in the end had no choice but to remain home as my girlfriend was in a near panic attack over the prospect of me spending a day with my housemates.

Two months ago, E moved out as her job had been increasingly posting her to a work location that was a lot further away than where she had worked prior. E moved to a different house in outer suburbia closer to work, but A and I wanted to have a farewell dinner for her as we had all (unusually) grown fairly close as housemates and friends. I approached my girlfriend about this, and after some back and forth, it once again turned into a sobbing session about how she still felt jealous over E, and if I went to that dinner as the three of us, she felt like she would have no choice but to end the relationship with me and break it off altogether. In the last week it's degenerated further and I've been put in a position where I've had to cut off E altogether - I explained this to E which wasn't a particularly good feeling, and consequently blocked her on social media after my girlfriend explained that she wouldn't feel happy unless I removed E from my life completely due to the ""damage I've done"".

E is not the only person I've been forced to cut off. I did have another female friend back in my old city that I still messaged regularly and cared about quite a bit. This was someone I had met on an online dating app and while we didn't end up in a relationship at all, we did end up building a solid friendship, though our conversation while platonic could border on what I guess would be a little ""flirtatious"" at times. My girlfriend was aware of this person for the duration of our relationship, but at one stage requested to see the content of our messages... I dislike people going through my phone so I resisted which upset her. I relinquished, she read through the conversation between myself and said friend, and was pretty hurt because she felt that I was too close to this friend in my old city and the nature of our discussion was to her, ""too friendly"". This was another situation where I was given the option of ""maybe breaking up"", or telling the friend that I couldn't speak to her anymore and blocking her as well. This one I can kind of understand given that it was someone that I met on a dating app quite some time ago, but in my eyes it still seemed a little unfair to be forced to unceremoniously axe a friendship altogether just to keep my partner from dwelling on it.

So much for keeping it short and sweet! I'm posting here because I need a little perspective though, this is the first time I've been in a relationship with someone who gets so passionate and upset over me having friends that are girls, and I genuinely don't know whether my behaviour is unreasonable or not. Do you think that in the above situations it's normal for a guy to have to cut friends off? Or is my partner perhaps a little zealous in her control of who I should and shouldn't associate with? My gut feel is that a lot of her anxiety over other women comes from some pretty big insecurity issues and that she has very little faith in me to do the right thing, but perhaps I really am the asshole here and I've unintentionally been gaslighting her. I really don't know. All I can say is that I kinda feel like the grim reaper is coming for my friendships one by one, and it's only a matter of time until I'm pretty cut off from a lot of people.

For the record, in most aspects, we're decent together - I enjoy the time I spend with her, and we get along well. I do love her, but having to axe friendships to keep her satisfied is starting to make me feel pretty dejected. I have tried EVERYTHING with her. I've tried sitting down and having a mature discussion, I've tried appealing to reason, I've tried literally everything I can to convince her that I have absolutely no desire to cheat, and she absolutely can not be told, even though I've never given her any reason to believe that I would cheat. It's actually been getting me pretty down lately because E was a really good friend... this jealousy issue is starting to hit deal breaker point unfortunately. I feel it's all a little unreasonable especially since I intrinsically trust my girlfriend and have never made a request for her to end a friendship with someone, nor have I ever asked her to stop talking to someone (though she professes that she would if I asked).

There it all is though. From my account of events here, would you say the time I spent with E was excessive? What about the old friend I met through an app? Are my girlfriend's fears of me being unfaithful warranted or valid? Does it all stem from insecurity? Or have I done something to really screw her up mentally that she's just unable to recover from?",0,0,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,self,Where do I draw the line at my girlfriend (25F) requesting that I (25M) cut off friends?,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/kwf8n5/where_do_i_draw_the_line_at_my_girlfriend_25f/,all_ads,5.0

The family I nanny for is being ridiculous. I have been there over a year &amp; don’t know how to handle this situation anymore. 
I go every morning around 5 am so the parents can work out. I get the kids ready for school, pack lunches, etc. while they are just standing in the way and get in the way by trying to micromanage everything. Lately when I get there in the morning, there has been TONS of baskets stuffed with laundry just left in the center room for me to do. Like literally so much laundry it’s insane. They literally would have to be grabbing random clean clothes and throwing them in the dirty laundry to be having that much everyday at this point. besides it’s not my job to fold her or her husbands clothes and underwear. NO THANK YOU! i feel like that is pretty rude. Also they always leave tons of dishes in the sink daily, esp. over the weekend. They don’t load/unload EVER. So i am coming monday morning after several days to tons of dirty dishes stacked, like that’s not my job! They also leave literally everything out &amp; expect me to put it away.I swear they have never cleaned the floors &amp; the second the kids leave for school with the dad ,the mom will walk up to me with a broom which wouldn’t be that big of a deal if it was messes the kids had made while i was there, but it’s not! it’s literally their messes that she is too lazy to pick up! she also has the most DISGUSTING closet. She has piles of dirty towels, makeup wipes, worn clothes, food, toys, etc and always says to me,” can u put my laundry away &amp; pick this up a bit.”it irritates me bc i am not her maid! and it’s getting out of hand. whenever i try to communicate boundaries she brushes me off. 
well recently she has been canceling several times a week at 5 am. &amp; asking me to come at 7ish instead. &amp; then after that also pushing me to come back around 8ish. It’s absurd honestly. She has done this quite frequently throughout my time with them but lately it is been a weekly thing. She will cancel the 5 am time seriously 5 minutes before i am supposed to be there, so i’m just all ready to go then sitting around for an hour super early, not to mention SHE DOESNT EVEN PAY ME WHEN SHE CANCELS! Is that rude?? i think it is. especially because it’s a constant thing. Well anyway i brought it up to her that i need to know if they are not going to have me come early at least the night before and stood up for myself &amp; set boundary for a line that i think they have crossed by a mile. Well ever since that, she has been pretty rude &amp;  acting like I am the one who did something wrong. Did I? I was more than nice enough than she honestly deserved when i talked to her &amp; am frankly quiet pissed that I am being treated like this. I have always done whatever they ask, shown up early &amp; everytime they have asked me to be there and gone above &amp;  beyond for them. I’m honestly pretty hurt about them acting towards me like this &amp; don’t know what to do at this point.

So today I have been hearing and seeing so much shit that isn't there.  

I used approx 1.2g of weed (bud), put it in a saucepan with milk and water and two tablespoons of coconut oil.  Cooked it about 25 minutes and ended up straining some of the weed out.  Chugged it down and waited.  

About 40 minutes later I really started to notice on it and the Intensity of the high got more and more messed as a few hours went by.  It has been roughly 7 hours since I drank the tea and while the effects r slowing down a tad,  I still feel it.  


Weird things that saw or heard 

- a car,  specifically it's headlights in the right side mirror coming close to my car.  

- I saw my brothera phone say incoming call on a bar across the top of his phone when it actually ended up being my phone ringing.  


- I kept thinking my brother was saying stuff that he wasn't and so I would reply and he would be like wtf lol

-i kept losing train of thought and forgetting where we were in the convo after like 10 seconds lol 

-kept hearing my ringtone going off over and over,  but quietly as if u turned the volume down on it

I proposed to my fiancée in early November. She moved in with me 3 years ago even though her parents weren’t quite okay with it at first. Over the years, we met with her family once a week and it seemed to me that my relationship between her family and I were improving. They never once mentioned how it was not right for their daughter to stay with me etc. Every time we met, we seemed to have a good time and bonded well. However, I’m under the impression that her parent’s don’t quite approve of us getting married yet. They said to her that they aren’t sure yet whether or not I am capable of taking care of her etc. I’ve loved her unconditionally and cared for her all those years and it’s really frustrating that they feel this way about me. It’s worth noting that about a couple months ago we got into an argument and she went home to her parents and probably said things about me that made them view me differently. She’s never left me like this and our relationship seemed to be going well all these years. She was a part of everything I did for 4 years and we even traveled across the world together for 6 months. At the night of our argument, she said she was very emotional and told her parents how she felt at the heat of the moment. We all talked this through and agreed that our argument was based on miscommunication and everything seemed to be okay. However, now her parents won’t let her stay with me because they feel that it’s not right or “traditional”. She’s been staying with me for 3 years now so I’m not quite sure why it’s such a big deal now anyway. She’s been staying with her family for 3 months now and I’m starting to think she’s having second thoughts about our relationship. She never made a post about our engagement and barely told anyone it. Even though she’s still living with her family, she swears that she wants to marry me and move back in with me, but she asked me to give her family time to consider everything and to “send her daughter off the right way.”

I’ve frequently done commissions and gift art of their furry characters for them, and I also regularly draw fanart for a couple fandoms that are furry adjacent like Animal Crossing and certain DND races- a friend of mine has a Tabaxi character who I adore and draw frequently just because she has a fun design. So, anthro animals are a frequent subject of my art and I don’t have any issues with furries in the slightest. 

A few days ago I was working on an extremely late Christmas gift (I got sick in the build up to Christmas and couldn’t finish it in time) for one of said furry friends of his and his boyfriend’s fursonas. It was totally SFW, they were just sitting together holding hands. My sister (17F) happened to come into my room to ask to borrow my Switch while I was working on it, and immediately freaked out when she saw what I was drawing. She called it disgusting and said she couldn’t believe I was “one of those animal fucking freaks”. I wasn’t in the mood for it so I told her it was for a friend and to leave me alone. She continued to rant about how it was just as bad that I was even friends with a furry and started throwing a bunch of baseless insults towards my friend- who she actually knows and is super close to. She even has a print of his art on her wall. A print of some of the characters from Five Nights at Freddy’s, all anthro animals. I pointed out the hypocrisy of this and told her she was being ridiculous to get so offended at perfectly innocent art featuring anthro animals when she herself is a fan of things that could be considered “furries”. She tried to argue it was different, at which point I lost my cool, told her to fuck off and be a brat somewhere else, and pushed her out of my room; not forcefully enough to hurt, I just sort of gently herded her out and shut the door in her face.

Well, apparently this has started world war three over fucking furries. My sister keeps crying about how I “attacked her”, was rude to her, and how my art is disgusting, pornographic, etc. My parents who are very conservative prudish types are furious at me for drawing things like that in their household and won’t listen to my explanations that there’s nothing more wrong with what I was drawing than Disney movies and Animal Crossing. I admit I maybe could have reacted with more maturity to my sister but I was trying to work and I stand by what I said that she was being stupid and hypocritical, even if I was harsh out of irritation. The whole situation feels trivial and honestly kind of funny to me but apparently everyone else thinks it’s the most serious thing in the world.

So here is my life in a nutshell 

Fell in love with a woman with two kids... obviously we are both broken

Fell in love with the kids too and up until last month it was returned

We always talked... for hours on end always using face time always texting

She would always ask me to come see her... it’s a two hour drive I would make the trips because her car isn’t as safe as my jeep 

We’d cook the kids breakfast together

We’d tell each other everything... like literally everything even give each other screen shots of conversations with out asking or feeling obligated to

Would talk about maybe having a kid together

She did insist I knew her ring size and favorite style of ring

I felt at peace around her... like “home” where I felt safe never on edge never stressed... I have never felt that way... not even in my own home where I’m surrounded by things that make me happy... she made me feel.. like nothing was wrong with me 

She even gave me a key to her place

My only complaint at this time is I have to park at the end of the street (one house down) so incase her mom or ex drive by they don’t see someone there

I would drop everything to see them

She would worry she annoyed me but never did told her every day I love her she would apologize for almost everything if she thought she did something wrong... even panic if I accidentally left a message read with no response 

She would beg me to never give up on her to not just let her push me away 

A month or so ago while on birth control she starts spotting and that’s never happened to her before

Sees ob/gyn about unrelated issue forgets to bring it up

Her mom tries to convince getting tubes tied and when she says no her mom threatens “you are on your own if you get pregnant again”

After would occasionally ask “do I look pregnant” to me which I would reply something smart ass in nature cause she is snarky and I assumed she was being snarky since she was on birth control

Later had a talk that both her kids were conceived on birth control... my dumb ass didn’t connect it 

We both aren’t exactly fans of the holiday season (nov-feb) most of my life trauma happens then and she was sexually assaulted 

Well  in November she had started getting exhausted more often... and shortly after she became distant... 

Which she wrote off to depression “being on a down” in combination to season... I’m also getting anxious cause most negative things happen in my life at this season

and Sporadically sick to her stomach and it got so bad at a point her mom insisted she get tested for Covid... it came back as negative for Covid and negative for Both types of the flu

Suddenly our calls are becoming very infrequent... even the texts are more “monosyllabic” like someone who isn’t really in the conversation “ok, yeah, sorry, idk”

Her five year old tells the abusive ex that mommy has a friend sleep over some nights

Suddenly my visits are becoming more late at night primarily after five year old is in bed... and then she starts trying to get me to leave before she wakes up which is around 8am

She also takes the key to her place back without my knowledge I only found out because I was on my way up ended up being a little early she was gonna be at her moms and she asked “what do you plan on doing till I’m done?” I said I just go lay down in the bed cause I didn’t sleep well her response was “how you gonna do that” cause I have a key Hun remember? “Are you sure about that?”

The key was gone her reasoning was “wanted to see how long before you noticed”

This all starts triggering my paranoia and anxiety because of my past ... every other time similar things like the distancing and lack of calls happened the person was cheating on me or using me... which she knew about my past

She tells me stop being paranoid it’s gonna end up pushing her away...

She no longer able to have a conversation about things that are bothering us she just says “I’m sorry idk what to say” and can’t even talk about what’s going on ... making me feel like I need to just suck it up and bottle it all... which makes me think irrational more... when she would call it would be for a few minutes then something came up and she would say “call you back in a couple minutes” three hours late I would break down and call her... couple times she wouldn’t call all day... leave my messages on “read”

I brought food and flowers to surprise her for a doctors appointment she gets anxious at doctors appointments especially ones that take blood even told me I was the only reason she didn’t lose it... cause I was waiting for her 

Well that same night a fight happens because she was just not communicating so I leave to go home instead of staying cause I felt like a burden 

Thanksgiving and she’s not communicating at all not even a happy thanksgiving 

Couple days later now Black Friday I was working and she wasn’t talking at all so paranoid me writes a message saying we should maybe go our separate ways because she seems really busy right now like she doesn’t have time for a partner especially one with a kid... this causes her to flip out and get angry like I was giving up on her she even thinks I was only doing it to go sleep with someone else... there is no one else just her she was the only person I wanted... still the only one

I drive up and this pisses her off and eventually I go try to sleep in my car... she insists I come in and lay with her... I notice she has 300$ worth of brand new BEATS ear buds while I am up there

I get back home the next day and it’s back to barely any communication...

My daughter and I start buying her and the kids gifts for xmas... my daughter insisting on using her own money she saved for the last year and half for her new best friend and daddy’s friend

I splurged on my daughter and my girlfriend and her kids maybe went overboard... she didn’t know how much but it was at least 1200$ it was my first year in a while being financially stable enough to provide a great Christmas for my kid so i I did it for them too

She says she’s got to do Christmas shopping and asks what my daughter likes... told her the same things as her oldest

A week or so goes by with minimal communication 

And during a FaceTime call I notice a new gaming chair pink and white with I find out it’s a 300$ gaming chair she’s has for a few days... says “I didn’t tell you because you’d be mad” I wasn’t mad nor would I had been... but she had no place for it since her bedroom barely had walkways because of a king size bed and a make up desk and two dressers and a 52+ inch tv

The only thing I was concerned about was “hey have you at least gotten my daughter anything for xmas? She’s bought you and the kids things... I don’t even care about me getting anything” she goes “not yet haven’t had time to” this was December 10th morning

About an hour later she sends me some “risqué” pics of her in the chair... notice that they were taken at night... it’s like 11am

I ask her if she took them at night; assuming the night before or couple days before; why she didn’t send them when she took them... like she normally would

Her response was “I knew you’d just be mad about the chair”... literally the only thing I’ve ever gotten mad about was the lack of communication 

But by this point I had been getting easily bothered.. partly because of my anxiety from the season and mostly from never talking... and the cop ex using every thing he can think of to get her to come back to him

Pretending to date a girl to unsuccessfully make her jealous

Using his parents divorce (had just been said by his mom) to ask her if she’s slept with anyone since she left him

Getting mad at her for telling him it’s not any of his business

Snooping through her stuff when he comes over to watch the baby while she runs errands or rests

Even out right asking for “one more special night”

Well my “bottling up” got full so I forced a confrontation between her and I... asking why she hasn’t told him yet... and if she didn’t I would

After an hour of texting and fighting... not like yelling just emotional fighting... she finally tells me “I haven’t told him yet cause it would upset him”
I took that as his feelings were more important than mine... she said “that’s not what I said” but I told her him not being made to stop and not knowing is bothering me cause he is trying at least once a week to get her back in some way... and it’s upsetting to me... but you don’t want to tell him because he will be upset... how is that not his feelings being more important than mine

Asked why her family hasn’t been told since it’s almost Christmas and she said that’s when she’d tell everyone... “because I know my family won’t like you... and I want them to like me” both of these response crush me to tears

Well the next day I feel bad about the fight... and I buy a bunch of flowers... probably more than I could of afforded at the time (it’s now December 11th) with the sole plan of driving up and surprising her

I asked what her plans were for the day and all she had was “taking the five year old to their dads for his weekend with her then back home with the 1 year old”

So I work until about 830pm then head up with the flowers and some macaroons i get there just after 11pm to find out... she’s not there... I called a couple times on the way up to chat and to just make sure she didn’t suspect I was coming up... but no answer

I get there and her cars gone she’s not answering calls or texts... so my brain goes panic and instantly thinks she’s cheating... My heart sinks and I lash out and contact the ex and ask him if she’s there if she’s cheating on me and been using me for a stupid Xbox for Christmas proving to him that I’m not lying showing him pictures that she took of me with the kids 

He lash’s back saying she’s with him

She wasn’t cause when he said that I drove to his place and she wasn’t there his car was and they both wouldn’t have the 1year old our in winter in the middle of the night... but she messages me... I’m assuming cause he called her pissed... she’s upset... I ask if she’s cheating and the last thing she say is “with cop ex?” And I said with anyone at all... she doesn’t talk to me after that

Well the week of Christmas stuff I ordered to be sent to her starts arriving

She still hasn’t talked to me I’m certain I’m blocked
I order roses with a card saying “I’m sorry for being an idiot” also bought a card that I wrote a poem on that I made and it was a “romance sorry”card also wrote a note on that explaining that I know I’m hard to deal with some times and I hope she gives me a chance

Flowers arrive xmas eve

Card arrives the 28th still haven’t heard from her but after the card was delivered she suddenly is reading messages on Instagram from me but no response yet

However on the 29th in the evening she gives me a call via Instagram saying “who have you been talking to and about what” I say no one and nothing... “the fuck you haven’t how about I call CPS on you!” I didn’t call CPS you I haven’t called anyone on you “fuck you you are the only one who knew” still not telling me about what but that lasts a whole couple minutes before ending “get fucked “ then hang up

I tried calling from my Google voice numbers she answer each one once hangs up when she hears it is me then blocks me

Try Instagram she says “no one else knows” then blocks me.... now blocked on everything

Next day the abusive ex (father of the five year old the one she hates and wish was dead his mental emotional and sexual abuse) calls saying I need to not threaten the well-being of his child and he wants me to never talk to his child’s mother again... tells me to stop sending stuff I hadn’t sent anything since “the shit hit the fan” aside from the card and the roses

But the shipping system right now is so far behind that the last thing I had sent to her arrived today

He threatens to press charges on me and also threatens to assault me won’t listen to me

But I’m breaking down cause she threatens to call child services to make a false report because someone reported her and she thinks it’s me

He is threatening me with violence 

January third the police call me ... ironically seeming like they are understanding of whats going on to the point of even saying “I’m surprised after all the things you’ve done so far she isn’t trying to talk with you” but say they don’t see me as malicious and they think this is just something that needs time for her to calm down... wait for her to reach out to you... she’s just obviously upset right now we will let her know a couple things may still arrive

Hell they even said it wasn’t unreasonable that I called multiple times after she accused me of something and not really telling me what i supposedly reported her for

But since then I have had a chance to recount events and see her having irrational reactions to some things... originally I put it as her borderline personality disorder and depression having her on a downward spiral and she’s still lashing out it explains most of what’s going on with her reactions and her tiredness drastically increasing to needing a nap every day for like four hours immediately after giving the 1 year old breakfast the getting the card to instantly thinking I called child services 

But thinking about the events/symptoms

Her spotting when she never has on the birth control except for her 1year old
Her asking me if she looks pregnant more than once
The Ob/gyn appointment (was told it was for a yeast infection and then told it was Vaginitis)
Her telling me she was on birth control both times she got pregnant 

I have spoken with a medical professional about this and they agree that the two likely options are pregnancy triggering the spiral or just the borderline personality order triggering it
They said BPD explains it without the possible pregnancy symptoms
But the pregnancy explains it all

Also said we are both in the wrong but both in the right...
In the wrong for not Accommodating each other’s coping methods
But in the right for expecting each other to respect those methods...


I honestly... don’t want to lose her... but I’m afraid she will always hate me now for something I didn’t even do...



I honestly would never do anything to risk her losing the kids... they are the main reason she’s alive if she lost them it would kill her... And if she did lose them and she still believed it was me behind it... I think that would kill me

Also when a fight happened towards the end happened I would ask her if she wanted to give up on me... she would jump to the “why so your can fuck someone else?” Mind set... and I would repeatedly reassure her there was no one else... never would be... 

I apologize for how messy this is... but I’m horrible at writing and I had to get it out

Adhd brain..


Also feel free to ask questions you need cleared up I will respond when I can and the best I can


In regards to “possible pregnancy” I would honestly love a child with her and we have talked about it as an option... but I wouldn’t specifically want to re go through the court/custody shit again with a woman who hates me... especially not two hours away... I would though because I refuse not to be in a child of mine’s life

So the pregnancy is scary yes... but she is someone I would want to have a child with...

And like I said earlier... I’m in love with her... she felt like home where I could be me... not on edge... safe from myself and the world... I have never had that not even in my own home or with my own family


I am also very afraid for my ex... I’m afraid with everything she’s going to fall off the deep end or worse... especially if she loses those kids... that would crush me worse than I am currently

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend and I have been dating for around 6 months now and everything has been pretty good up until the past week. I realized a few days ago that he had set his relationship status so that only he could see it, when i confronted him about it he told me he did it when we had an argument ( over a dog) and he didn't know if i was going to break up with him or not. Before we even started dating i tried to be as open and honest with him as i could because i didn't want him feeling surprised or shocked by anything. I told him that if there is any point when we are dating that i feel like its not working out then i would tell him in that moment. Just as i would want him to do to me if he felt that way. So i was hurt when he told me he changed it for that reason because i never wanted him to worry about something like that. We moved on and got over the status change and i thought we were good again. Until today when we got home he got a phone call and i noticed the area code but he said it was a telemarketer ( i never asked who it was) but i got pretty suspicious because he said the caller was from a different state. I know the area code and it was for the area we live in and i live in a very rural area so there aren't telemarketers calling from where i live. When i talked to him and told him i was suspicious and worried because i didn't feel like what he was telling me lined up with what I've seen, he got defensive and was telling me he wasn't talking to anyone. I told him i would never accuse him of anything unless i had evidence and i knew for sure. I asked him if i could call the number so it would make me feel better about the situation but he told me he blocked the number, i asked if he could unblock it, then he told me he blocked and deleted the number. I felt that was really weird but i dropped the subject and took about 30 minutes so i could think and process everything. During that time, he ended up sending me the number so i asked how he un-deleted the number since I've never heard of that being possible and he ignored my question. I tried calling it but it was a dead line, i told him. I told him i still wasn't feeling okay with the situation. I asked if he could send me a picture of the call history but the area code and the time he got the call didn't match up with what i saw and the time was 2 hours after we had gotten home so i confronted him again about that but he ignored me and he's saying now that he's heartbroken about everything and doesn't know why i don't believe him. He's lied to me quite a bit during our relationship so i can't trust what he says a lot of the time. I'm lost as to what i should do because in my gut i feel like something going on and a lot of things hes said aren't lining up.

He's a year younger. For the past 6 years he's been suffering deeply. He has bipolar disorder, gender dysphoria, social anxiety. 3 near suicides, as far as I know. I think the first attempt was in 2015, the second 2 years later. Both of those ended in hospital trips. It was a miracle he survived the second one. The most recent was a few months ago. He went to the downstairs bathroom in the middle of the night to slit his wrists, but I went down after and my presence stopped him.

I've always been scared for him but I kept the fear out of my everyday life. Does that make me a bad person? I've been so guilty about that, increasingly so as I grow older. What if he dies thinking I don't care about him? I don't have the serious talks with him, I just don't know how to initiate and I couldn't will myself to. He told my mom that he thought she'd be wrecked if he died, but I wouldn't - I'd be fine. I don't... I'm just lost. This has been really sinking in since the most recent close call. I've tried my hardest to show that I care day to day.

I have school from 6-5 because of after school things and when I get home I have 2 hours of house chores to do. I have started getting missing assignments in school because I can’t keep up with everything.

I asked my stepsister to please start doing the few chores she was assigned. She then proceeded to get angry with me stating that she was always tired from working her 9-2 shift and that I shouldn’t expect her to help out. 

I then blew up on her that she barely ever does any work and that my parents aren’t even making her pay for insurance, rent or a phone bill and that she just leeches off the fact the her dad (my stepdad) is kind. She stormed off to her boyfriends place and later told my parents. They agree that she does need to start helping out a bit but said that there was no reason for me to blow up on her. She claimed she had depression when she was a young kid and that she’s still recovering even though she never went to a therapist or took meds.

I'm still crying about it and I don't know if i have overreacted or I'm in the right.

I got a call from my father this morning (him and my mum are divorced) and he asked me if we wanted some mini pork pies for lunch (it's the best translation i can give you. It's a very popular food where i live).
I said yes, knowing that my mother would appreciate them too. This also meant that he was inviting himself for lunch. 

He shows up and I was making a salad. He had brought his dog with him which we have asked him multiple times not to do because we have cats and they get scared (but that's another story). 
The dog was being hyper and bumping into me while i was making the salad so I told the dog that he was being a pain and that's when things started to get tense because my father told me that i couldn't say that because i don't live with the dog and i don't know what it's like.
I told him that i could because the dog was being a pain to me in that moment. He of course had to object and we argued until i gave up because i wasn't going anywhere.

I finished the salad and i was setting the table when he put some music on his phone.
His is important because we had fought a lot in the past because of the music. Every time he visits us he put some music on (without asking). The first time he did it i told him to turn it off because i didn't want to listen to music in that moment. 
So he now has put this idea in his mind that i don't like music and I'm a weirdo because according to him i should listen to music all day long and no matter how many times i told him that i do like and listen to music, i just didn't want to listen to it in that specific moment, he doesn't listen and doesn't care.
From that moment on he has been provoking me putting some music on every time he is over.

Today i tried to ignore him and (this is where i might be TA) when we all sat at the table i turnd it off saying :""now let's turn this off and eat"".
He exploded saying that music was beautiful and if i didn't like it i had something wrong and i needed to seek help (which really hurt me). My mother tried to defend me but i told her to stay out of it.
I told him that if he knew that i had something wrong why he wasn't doing anything to help me, but he didn't hear me because he was talking over me. He calmed down and we sat again. I passed him the salt and vinegar and instead of thanking me he said something about the music again to provok me.
I tried again to explain that i do like it but it was time to eat now, but he didn't want to listen, he was just spitting venom. My mum intervened again which made it even worse, so he took some pork pies, the dog and left, but by that time i was already crying.

So I'm asking you: AITA? Should've i let him finish the song even if i didn't want to listen to it in that moment?

so a few years ago he left academia (he's high functioning) and came to live with me since he was about to get kicked out of his apartment on campus on the other side of the country. that was fine, i offered him a place and suggested we split costs. he'd been on his own for a while so i figured he'd be capable of pulling his weight along with me and it would improve my life rather than be a burden. we'd share costs and labor and it'd be win-win until he got back on his feet.

but it's been a complete burden, he never looked for a job, and he's literally never offered to help me at all with anything -- no housework, no bills, no errands, avoids social events with extended family, and if you asked him, he'd get confused and say ""oh. well nobody asked me to do these things"" or just say ""no, i dont think i'll do &lt;x&gt;"". this is completely absurd but that's how he views the world. he is literally the definition of non-maliciously entitled, more like... childishly entitled. it doesn't even occur to the him the amount of sacrifices other people make on his behalf and he has literally never thanked anybody or apologized on his own volition.

to make it worse, every conversation with him is either 1) me listening to a rant on a subject he doesn't really know anything about (and instead is just extrapolating based on a few subjects he knows, ala that one xkcd comic on physicsts) or 2) him second-guessing your intelligence and motives then interrupting you constantly -- regardless of the topic or tone of conversation. 

here's an example:

- me: ""i had to deal with a client today who did &lt;horrible thing&gt; and""
- him: &lt;interrupting&gt; ""maybe they did &lt;horrible thing&gt; because &lt;random justification he just came up with&gt;?""
- me: *sigh* ""no, because [...]""
- him: &lt;interrupting&gt; ""but perhaps &lt;more justifications&gt;""
- me: ""no, because [...]""
- him: &lt;interrupting&gt; ""what do you mean 'no'?""
- me: ""i mean it's highly unlikely that &lt;random justification&gt; is why the person is secretly not doing horrible things""
- him: ""why did you say ""no"" instead of putting it like that originally?""

i guess this is fine in isolation, but *every time* there could possibly be an explanation that invalidates me, he interrupts with it with seemingly no understanding how rude and exhausting it is. he is allergic to any assertion that lacks enough qualification. you cannot tell him something without going through an exhaustive list of every possible exception to the statement or else he'll ask about those. and even then, he'll just start contradicting you with devil's advocate positions on everything because he has no idea how else to engage in a conversation.

to make things worse, as his younger brother, i'm one of the last people in the world he'd ever take advice from. he'd hold deeply the opinion of a random homeless person who mocks his appearance more than he'd listen to me about things like ""maybe you should go outside for a walk at least once a month"" or ""maybe you should get an email address or phone so the rest of the world and our family doesn't have to communicate through me to you"".

I don’t have that many close friends, and I also don’t have the contact info of some of my closest ones (they aren’t on the social media platforms I use if I’m recalling correctly). 
The rest of my family puts effort into social interaction, but my view on that became clear enough that I wrote a poem about it:

“Poem 75: (10-5-2020)
Trying makes it false
Trying makes it true
Trying makes uneasy fools
Out of me and you
Trying makes it seem a loss
What would elsewhere seem a boon
Trying makes a happy mind
Seem less green and much more blue
Trying makes a poor reflection
Of authentic real connection
Trying makes me wish I didn’t
Now I envy your existence”

Basically, I view friends as the people with whom you enjoy your time on the way to doing other things, like work or schoolwork. Is this wrong? I feel like if I went to the effort, I’d be wasting my time, because I wouldn’t be enjoying it. Any level of effort to socialize beyond what little I already attempt feels fake, artificial, fraudulent, like a facade. Yet I *love* talking to people. I just only like talking about things with substance, deep topics, important discussions. Am I wrong or misguided?

I was on another social media platform and I noticed that my son-in-law posted a posting about how much he loves my daughter and how they are going to be together through the ins and outs it was actually quite lovely.

My problem is my daughter does not use that social media platform and hasn't for a long time, so there was no chance of my daughter seeing that post. I asked my daughter if I could say something about it on social media and she gave me the go-ahead. I asked my son-in-law on social media why did he post that when my daughter would not be seeing it and his response was "" True but the example is still set for others to remember what is important in their lives and this is still a good platform to make a public declaration to the world since tv is exclusive and radio isn't big enough."" 

This was my response. ""so you're making a public declaration to your wife on social media that she no longer used to set an example for others?  Isn't that sort of like I made a donation in your name thing, she doesn't get to enjoy it but you get bragging rights? ""

Then his mother, whom I have never met, came in on her broom and started messaging me and defending his post. Then others got involved and it caused an argument between my daughter and SIL. 

I asked my daughter if she knew what the post said and she told me that she did not know what the post said at that time. My son-in-law never told her what the post said until I said something. Now they're marriage is rocky at best and I'm aware of that fact because my daughter tells me all the time the things that he does.

Here he is still dragging the conversation on and on so I just kinda zone out. I’ll admit I do like to be right about things but I’m ok if I happen to wrong about something. He loves being right and will assert his point as such. We are both stubborn and want to to be in control (I’m a Capricorn and he’s a Leo). I sometimes don’t even like going places with him. When we’re in the car he plays his music (which isn’t my cup of tea), I just look out the window or scroll through my phone. When I play music in the car he often criticizes the hell out of it. I have told him that it bothers me but of course he continues to do whatever he wants to do. Being out in public with him is even worse. If we’re at the grocery store or the mall he’ll start dancing to the music that’s playing or he’ll make animal noises i.e. a monkey. There was one time we were at a shoe store checking out at the register, he started making monkey noises. The cashier kept asking where that noise was coming from and I told her it was my boyfriend. She was so uncomfortable, she actually told him to stop. I felt so embarrassed for him but he didn’t care at all. He didn’t realize how uncomfortable she was though it was written on her face and she told him to stop twice. I don’t know what to do at this point. I want to stay with him because I love him but I don’t know if that’s enough. He needs to work on himself mentally, emotionally and physically. He knows he needs work, but doesn’t take to the steps to improve. We both have mental health problems and have acknowledged them. I’m in therapy but he isn’t. I’m not perfect or better than him be any means but I do tend to think maybe I’d be a better, a healthier me if I wasn’t with him. Should I cut him loose for both our sakes or can things be fixed and we continue to grow together?",0,0,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,self,I’m (26F) thinking about breaking up with my (25M) boyfriend...I’m so lost on what to do,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/krt3ss/im_26f_thinking_about_breaking_up_with_my_25m/,all_ads,3.5

Some background: we met when I was studying abroad in Kenya for a semester. She actually was the one who approached me when I was hanging out in the library. We had a lot in common and she suggested going to see a horror movie with her and a friend in downtown Nairobi. We quickly became fast friends after that first outing and we tried to hang out as often as we could. Going to the mall, going out to eat, the library, cafeteria, her apartment, my dorm room, etc. I always had fun with her and I enjoyed talking to her; I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t attracted to her, but I never said anything or made a move. To put it bluntly, I am inexperienced in regards to romance and relationships. I’ve had plenty of female friends but barely ever had a girlfriend. Not to mention I didn’t want to ruin the friendship that Sam and I already had. My semester ended and I said goodbye. But We both kept in contact for the next three years. When I make good friends I try my hardest to keep them. Texting, the occasional video chat, Instagram....and I always enjoyed it when I got to talk with her. She is probably one of my oldest friends.
So this past summer Sam called me up and we struck up a video chat conversation and the topic of sex came up (don’t remember how). We, jokingly, both said some flirty things and she said that when I ever came back to Kenya to visit we should both do it, even if we’re both in a relationship. I said back, “It’s not like I never thought about it before.” I was kinda half joking. She was surprised when I said that. Then she confirmed if I was talking about having sex with her. I said yes. Then she asked why I never said anything, and I told her that I didn’t want to ruin the friendship we had. I don’t remember how we ended that conversation, but we kept up our usual contact for the next few months. Some conversations more flirty then others. She told me that if I had made a move on her when we were at University together, she probably would’ve said no, confirming my suspicions that it might have ruined our friendship, but she wished I said something. She’s still mad at me for being too hesitant and dense!
So we enter the New Year and Sam calls me to video chat over the weekend. We are both really flirty with each other at this point and we both confess that we like each other. The next day I asked her if she wants to be in a long distance relationship with me and she readily agrees. We’re both new to the long distance relationship thing, but both Sam and I are willing to make it work.
The last few weeks have been great. I’m happier than I’ve been in a long time and I love talking to her more than I ever have. I want to be with her so much it’s driving me crazy! The 8 hour time difference and the poor cell reception are the biggest hurdles and annoyance at the moment. We’re planning on her visiting in July for a couple of weeks, but she’s told me she wants to move to another country someday. There’s nothing I wouldn’t love more than for her to move here, but I’m worried about her finding a job and making a life for herself here. I don’t mind moving either, but I’m worried about finding another job and supporting myself as well.
So what I want to know if anyone else has been in a similar relationship and how did you make it work? How long did you have to wait before you could both be together? How did you guys make a life for yourself? Did one of you move to the others country or did you both move? What was the most difficult thing about the long term relationship? Did you guys ever fight and how did you resolve it? Honestly any advice or reassurance would be welcome.
For context, or if you care, I’m white and she’s black. She got her degree in International business; I got my degree in Environmental science.
She’s 25; I’m 24
We’re both working full time at the moment (though I want to find something else)

I got overwhelmed with the comments asking for specifics so I thought to delete the previous and put everything here so you can give me your unbiased opinion. People have commented on my previous post with extremely helpful advices, however, I'd like to know as much opinions as I can so I can make my own. I'm sorry if some of you would see this unimportant or stupid, but it's a really tough time for me right now. 

Me (29F) and my boyfriend (32M) are together now for 7 months. I'm an Architect and he is a Mechanical Engineer. We have a great relationship and we have moved together in the last month. It's been great with him, however, there is something that he did and I don't know if that's something worrying or not.

I have been in only 4 relationships during my adult life. 3 of them I was sexually active. However, this last one is the only satisfactory one. He puts me first, and very gentle with me. Whenever he wants to have sex he always asks me if it's OK. Even during sex if he wants to do something he asks is it OK for me to do this? or how would you like for us to do that? He never does anything ""sexually"" with me without asking first.

Now, about 2 weeks ago, he was having a very bad day at work. When he returned home once he entered, he came to me and said I'm sorry but I need you so much now and he started kissing me. I was in shock at first not because the act but because of his eagerness. When we broke the kiss I said OK, and we rushed to the bedroom. That day he was like someone possessed. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad I enjoyed it. But he wasn't that tender he used to be but he was like a man on a mission. What really was weird was that I felt his brain was somewhere else. When I finished and became so sensitive for him and told him to ok stop. He stopped, and rolled over. He didn't even finish himself!

Later that evening, he came to me apologizing for that, and I was ""Why are you apologizing there was nothing wrong?! and I enjoyed it?!"" He said that he is apologizing for not being himself and changing the way we do love. I said it's OK and we laughed. After sometime I asked again what got into him? and he said he had a very bad day at work, there was an accident and someone died. He once again apologized for his behavior and refused to talk anymore about the accident at work till this day. Again he didn't force me or anything like that at all.

When I spoke to my close friend (27F), she told me that this is worrying. And asked me if he is Bipolar or something? She even said that maybe his being loving and caring at first was an act. I mean it's not he took me by force, it was just different from each time we had sex that's all. She kept saying that he's been a typical man, taking what he needs selfishly. And I should be careful around him.

I don't know how I should react to this?! He's a great character honestly, but my friend's words hung above me, and now I don't know how I should feel. He senses there is something wrong, asked me about it and I said it's fine. So, he said he won't pressure me to talk but he's there if I need to talk.

I really don't know what to do. And my friend keeps asking me to tell her how he reacts to this and that, and she always says things like ""see he reacted like that in this situation because he has insecurities, and that would affect you"". And her logical explanation for somethings really gets me and makes me wonder a lot. The more she talks, the more I feel distant from him, and I'm now considering breaking up with him. As I'm becoming afraid of how things would turn in the future, although everything seems fine now. 

She has always been not very fond of him since day one. My boyfriend is originally from Egypt and she has some reservations on men from the middle east. She has NEVER been disrespectful to him or made any attempt at humiliating him as well. So please don't call her a racist. She has a right for her own opinion. She's been my best friend since elementary school. We share almost everything with each other. She's the person that I normally go to for advice. And I really value her opinion so much.

Can anyone advice me please?!

Every time they get together, they just sit around and drink and talk from early morning until after midnight and then just crash anywhere, like 20+ people in a 2 bedroom place sharing 1 bathroom for sometimes 3+ days in a row. Although I enjoy hanging out with these people during the day and they are usually very nice, I don’t like spending the night on people’s floors and couches, especially since some of them don’t really have clean houses so it’s just very uncomfortable for me. If we go visit them out of town, I just suck it up. But If they happen to be visiting our town, I tell my boyfriend that I would like to go home and sleep in my own bed after the get together is over for the day and then rejoin them in the morning. However, he says that’s rude and gets very annoyed with me if I bring up not attending the event or even just not staying the night. He thinks I don’t like spending time with his family but that’s not true at all! Just simply don’t like staying in other people’s houses if I can help it! I grew up in a very small family and if we ever did get togethers, we don’t stay the night, we just go home. And yes, they keep getting together in large multi family gatherings during the pandemic which I am very against doing but have to go along with it or else “I’m rude and don’t like to spend time with them” according to him. Since the pandemic, my family has not done any gatherings so I am free to attend all of my bf’s family gatherings.

AITA if I don’t spend the night at every family event? Am I obligated to? Don’t think I am but bf thinks otherwise so just wanted to get other opinions.

Edit:
This is literally the only big issue I have with him (his family comes first I guess?) so don’t think it’s worth breaking up over and we always have a great time together otherwise and he’s always sweet and considerate outside of family stuff which I only have to deal with a few times a year.

this is my first reddit post, so please bare with me. This is going to be somewhat long.

So I've \[F26\] have been dating my BF \[M35\] for a little less than a year now. He is twice divorced. The first ex-wife was crazy, and cheated on him while he was deployed (confirmed by his friends and family, which makes me more inclined to believe him), and the second one cheated on him (confirmed by the ex-wife's bestfriend), and then soon after left him.

The first incident was after two months of dating, he had texted me asking me if it would be okay if his ex-wife came over with her dog -while she was in town, so that her dog and my BF's dogs can play (because they had known each other for so long). This was before the divorce was finalized, and I did think it was weird, however I did appreciate him for letting me know, and asking me about my opinion and that if I was uncomfortable with it, that he would decline her request. Back then, I thought it was much too soon for me to be a deciding things of that matter (""supposed platonic"" things) with my BF and his ex-wife. I thought since the divorce was going through, (and the paper work is there to prove it) there wasn't much for me to disagree on this early on without sounding crazy and controlling. So I said, ""It's not my place to decide this for you. If you feel as though this is something you want or need to do, then do so. I trust your judgement"". He replied and said,  ""I don't need any conclusion from her. She just wants her \[ex wife\] dog to see my dogs while she is back in town"". In conclusion he said, she came over for 15mins, my BF's roommate was home for the entirety of the interaction. He said it was very awkward he said, then she left, and they didn't divulge about anything that had to do with the divorce or their past. I took all of this in good faith. But in hindsight -knowing myself I should've spoke up and said I wasn't comfortable with it.

The second incident was due to my insecurities, leading me to find things I didn't want to find in my BF's social media. In the beginning of our relationship I noticed that he was no longer following this girl he dated previous to me \[we'll call her C\], and C was no longer following my BF on Social Media. But as soon as my BF and I got more serious, and he started posting me, I noticed that they were following one another. I was skeptical because people who like drama tend to revisit past lovers when they know those past lovers are now happy, and they themselves aren't. I confronted him about this, and he said, ""Yes, she messaged me and said she unfollowed me \[my BF\] and my roommate when she ended things"". And he said nothing else about it. I got angry because I felt as though he was hiding this from me. A little background, C -I feel was my BF's ideal type of girl. And it angered me that in that moment he did not think of how hurtful this was to me that he was talking to a recent ex, when he should've known that her intentions were not wholesome. C never officially dated my BF. But they were long distancing across the country. C ended things with my BF, and I feel like even now my BF is not over her, which is why he allowed her to come back in to his life. Shortly after, he unfollowed C because he knew how upset I was about the whole thing. Then shortly after that I noticed  C had unfollowed my BF. Which confirmed my suspicions of C keeping tabs on my BF.

Tell me if I have legitimate reasons not to trust him. He also still had pictures of his ex wife on his social media as well as a few posts about C.

Besides all of this, he is a pretty good, open and attentive partner. Probably the most loving BF I've ever had.

After a few weeks I realized that she was very temperamental and didn’t really think like an adult. For lack of better words she was more of the “young wild and free” type and I’m more subdued having gotten all the party scene out of my system. But what I also started realizing is that she is extremely temperamental and sensitive. Simple things will get her annoyed or upset and when she gets upset it takes a LOT to get her to calm down again and frankly it’s exhausting. A lot of times I feel like I have to put up with her because she never realizes how much effort I put into our relationship and how much I suppress my own emotions to spare hers. 
I’ll give you an example, I went over to her house one night (a 45 minute drive from my house) and she got upset over something so small I can’t even remember what it is and she began to hold it over my head and was being very unpleasant. When I told her I was sorry for whatever I did and that she’s being kind of unpleasant she completely blew up and got upset at the fact that I called her unpleasant. This is something that frequently happens where she can’t take any form of criticism and she’ll call me harsh or mean for saying anything negative about what she’s doing. I feel like her emotions are prioritized over mine and she’ll call me sensitive when I say that anything she’s doing is making me upset. 
I know what you’re going to say- break up with her, and trust me I’ve thought about it and we’ve had many fights that get very close to that. But honestly I can’t leave her and I’ve tried before. I’m too attached. She has depression and has fallen down a deep hole and I try to suppress my needs for now because she’s in a bad place mentally so I tell myself that this isn’t really her.

We were out shopping at a thrift store and she found a purse she wanted, it was $9. I told her to put it in the cart. She didn’t get anything else from the store because there wasn’t much she was interested in. 

I set the bag down at the checkout with the rest of the items I was buying since it was just one item she found so I wanted to save time and group it with my things instead of doing separate checkouts, we arrived back home, I got a good look at the purse and I really, really liked the bag. I know she found it herself, and I already have so many purses myself but I searched for it online after she found it and can’t find it anywhere, so this could be the only time I’d find it. 

My daughter was looking at the bag, I told her how much I loved the bag and that it was $9. She was talking about how she liked it very much as well. I felt bad that she bought me a coffee mug I liked at the shop so I told her that she could use the bag once in a while if she wants, or if she really liked it that she could buy it from me for $9. 

Apparently her and her dad had a secret conversation over texting- her father and I are separated, we have been for several years. He sent me a rude message about how he doesn’t pay me hundreds of dollars of child support for me to not get my daughter something, especially since her birthday is coming up. I responded and told him that it’s not as if he’s ever given her anything for her birthday or for Christmas so he’s being awfully hypocritical about parenting, then he argued that I don’t let him see our daughter. 

I offered my daughter that she could borrow the bag OR buy it from me for $9; she had 2 choices. I bought this bag so it is ultimately mine. She can buy her own gifts if she wants, she’s an adult at 18; adults buy themselves gifts if they really want them for their birthdays.",0,0,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,self,AITA for keeping a bag for myself that my daughter wanted to buy instead of giving it to her as a birthday present?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/kwtrbj/aita_for_keeping_a_bag_for_myself_that_my/,all_ads,1080.0

And now, due to a combination of horrific events that have happened between us during lockdown, I am emotionally and mentally traumatised by his behaviour and have become a person that I don't want to be and have been experiencing severe mental episodes similar to that of somebody suffering with Bipolar disorder. I've become so unwell that I have lost sight of who I am, I've become an insecure and hysterical mess, I've lost a significant amount of weight and have never looked so grey in my life, my eyes have constant dark circles to the point that I look like I've actually been given two black eyes and I'm now having to get support from New Era in order to help me realise the abuse I've been experiencing and to help me stay out of that situation for good. 

Due to the fact that me and my partner had been together for 11 years, he was my second 'proper' boyfriend as a teen and what I thought to be the love of my life. He is all I have known since I was 19 and we have always been so good together and trusting of eachother that I never imagined we would ever come to an end. We were best friends, engaged to be married; we were supposed to be getting married earlier this year (but then covid hit so we postponed until next year...I'm actually thankful for covid now), we were planning to start a family soon after getting married, I thought we would grow old together, I thought he would die for me like I would for him, I thought he would support me through anything, and most importantly I thought he knew me inside out and understood how damaged I was as a person and how much I needed him to be my best and only friend. 

At one point, I believed he was all I needed. And now, he has hurt me more than I could ever have imagined to the point that I do not recognise him anymore. He has blamed his recent abusive behaviour on the fact that he has also been going through depression for 18 months and has more recently been mentally broken down by discovering that I had feelings for my friend (which he only discovered by violating my personal property and reading my journal....I had never acted inappropriately towards my friend or told him how I felt about him beforehand and I wasn't intending to, I just needed to talk to myself on paper about my feelings and process my thoughts but he violated those thoughts). 

My now ex-partner says that my friend is apparently somebody that he, I quote ""physically hates and wants to see die"" and that the fact that he already hates this person so much only fuelled his anger about my feelings and stated that this was the reason I was not allowed to speak to my friend anymore (I had worked with my partner for 5 years and my friend had also been our boss at one time, so my ex-partner feels very hard done by from the decisions made by the company and by our boss/my friend leaving the company nearly 2 years ago). So although I did not share the same hateful feelings towards our boss/my friend, I was told by my (now) ex-partner that I should share the same hateful feelings towards this person and should never want to speak to him anyway. 

Towards the end of September, after trying again to get in touch with my friend one evening to say thankyou/goodbye, I experienced 2 of the worst nights I've ever had with my now ex-partner. After explaining to him the reason why my friend meant so much to me and why I wanted to say goodbye if I was never going to be allowed to talk to him again, my now ex-partner absolutely flipped his lid, treated me horrifically, traumatised and mentally scarred me and left me so broken and numb inside that I haven't been able to open up to anybody else about what happened to me as a child since. 

I feel like I've gone back to the scared little girl I once was and I don't know how to open my mouth to say the actual words about what happened to me for so long (which is another reason I wanted to write it here and ask for help, because I seem to be able to say what I need to say more clearly by writing it down, rather than talking out loud). 

Now, as a result of everything, I am numb inside and mentally scarred. I am unable to regain the feelings I once had for my ex and I don't ever see a future with us again. Although he was previously my whole life and all I know, he is not the kind of person I want to be with, and he is not the kind of person who will ever be good for my mental health or happiness. His opinions and reactions have shocked me. His justifications seem unreasonable to me, I have never been untrustworthy and I believe I deserve the respect to be trusted. I definitely don't want that kind of relationship where I don't feel secure or trusted. 

However, he is my partner of 11 years, he is all I know, I'd like to be able to stay friends and stay in touch every now and again to go for a drink, or have a smoke together (we both smoke cannabis), or even just go for a walk to catch up and just have a laugh like we used to do, as friends. 

But after everything, he remains hopeful we will reconcile in the future and that there's hope for us. I really don't think so, and I have been clear in my intentions to not return to this relationship and I am 100% certain it is the absolute right decision for me, however I am finding it difficult not to see or speak to him everyday (because he is all I know...we have been together for 11 years, lived together for the last 7, worked together for the last 5, and were engaged for the last 2...we did everything together, went everywhere together, spent every single waking moment knowing where eachother was). 

Although it was suffocating, it is also my only way of life. I don't know anything else, I don't know how to live or be on my own, I've always lived with someone (my own parents as a child, my friends during uni, my ex-partner's parents while we were saving for a house deposit, and then straight into a house with my now ex-partner). Now that I have made the first jump and left the relationship, I am desparate to start a new life and be happy in myself again, so I'm itching to move away and live on my own for a while. 

However I'm so concerned for my ex, since I've left he's lifeless and isn't looking after himself. He needs help. I don't want anything bad to happen to him and I worry about him being okay. I feel like it is stopping me from doing what I really need to do for myself. I don't want to end up going back to him, but I can't bring myself to have no contact with him out of worrying for his safety and wellfare.

I want to go travelling and do all the things I've been held back from doing for so long, but I'm terrified and don't know if I'm just too mentally broken to do this on my own. How can I find the courage to go somewhere on my own? Where is safe enough for me to go so I can find my confidence again? I feel so vulnerable right now that I don't know who to listen to, or where to turn and I'm just so lost.

i have begun to listen to David Berman again. i originally started listening to him about a year ago or so. His music was first introduced to me when i watched a Exurb1a video about him. I watch him for similar reasons to why i listen to his music. The pacing of the videos and the way he eloquently writes the scripts is calming. The constant pitch of his voice is calming and so is the regular flow of words is relaxing. He makes good vidoes on philosofy and physics. it allows me to lose focus of what is currently going on.

it's one of the things i do to lose lose focus. it helps with stress, usually i dont do that because it only works when i am off the edge. usually i just talk to myself , it is a general of my mental state throughout the year

starts when i panic and or break down, not exactly anything unique. lying in bed feeling like shit. voice in my head just making noise. noise like the crouds in a buisy trains station or a classroom when people are just shouting out , similar to when you have a worthless supply teacher and the class descends into anarchy. ironically those where my favourite calsses, the chaos is so loud and evenly distributed it's quite enjoyable to watch. trying to guess who would cross the line and get the teacher to shout that little bit more, and when it begins to settle down. plant one dumb stupid idea in someone's head because it would be funny. admitidly that head would not always be other people's , i had my fair share of stupid shenanigans. As i was saying my mind goes on a mad one and i cant sleep , cant stay awake either, my mind switches off while it is needed and popps the fuck off when it isnt. in comes all of bombardement of info form Exurb1a and david berman ect. as well as the alcohol

then once the storm has calmed and it's delt with, i build myself back up . and more. 

i have always had a thing to talk to myself , slowly as i continued to do this more and more as time whent on i began to beleive it. originally it was more of a thing when i need to do a chore, scrub the top of the plate then clean the sides then the bottom in case the dumb son of a bitch eating from it somehow put food or sauce on the bottom side, the plate being mine. regardless , it slowly became more of a conversational thing. similar to how you have arguments in a shower and later developped into ligitimate conversations.

i have attempted at times to name whatever it is, i know what it is , it is a coping mechanism of sorts and despite me knowing it , when i face it , it's like i never knew to begin with either because i am upset and dont want to leave this world i have built for myself or because i just fear realising the truth that i hide up behind a set of walls 

the most common time i notice myself doing it is when i walk, a repetitive mechanical motion where i need minimal thought , especially if it is a path i walk often. it will begin as a thought in my head and then becaume a slight mutter , then to a normal tone and volume of talking. loud enough to realise i am speaking by the time i get to my destination , but by then i have forgotten what was happening. or rather i have forgoten that i was walking on my own. i will have had the impression that the whole time someone was there the whole time. this is because i can not actually tell wether this is the case once it is at this stage . i will say somehting and something will reply. i will , but i cannot tell that at the time.

the general type of conversation will either be about things that have happened on that day, particular memories (these happen quite often and often are reccursive and happen often) or things i would like to do in the future. often because of the fact that i cannot notice that it is fake (i dont really think it is fake , i mean in a sence that it isnt actually someone talking to me then yes it is fake but as i will explain later i dont think it is entirely fake in the sense of it being a lie) and so due to me beleiving it , i will therefore beleive everysingle word of it. which as i am sure you can probably guess it is quite detrimental as i beleive all of the negative things said to me by him/her 

an other thing that happens often is me in a sense reliving memories i have with people i havent met in years, i find it quite pathetic but honestly i cant do withought it at times. although i do say i relive them, this isnt always the case. it often is different to what happens. i ususally begin from the memory as a starting point and then get carried away with either a senario where it all goes to shit and the people i remember interrogate me and reprochem me on everythign i do and all or i am the main character and happy happy kinda thing which is often by then that i realise that i am doing it again and it is all ""made up"". however despite it being made up so to speak , it isnt a lie and to me it just feels like reality , i know it isnt true but it feels as if it is and takes a while (can be from 1 or 2 days to a month)  to really realise that the event did in fact not occur and that it doesnt feel true (as if it did happen) anymore.

by then i am back to the beggining of the cycle again and am back to the beggining of the cycle, my mind is breaking it's self down as i am caught into the crossfire

if i could decribe it in one way i would call it similar to a sand castle. sand castles are made to stand tall, but being made of sand and being beside the sea, inevitably they will be crushed by either natural wave and wind, or some little shit comming over to trample all over it.

I had 4 cavities I’d been putting off for a while, so the dentist agreed to fill them all at once. The appointment was scheduled for 2 hours, later in the day, after work.

I normally snack on a granola bar every day at work. The store was out of my regular kind, so I’d bought some chocolate banana bars. They were DELICIOUS. I couldn’t help myself, and I ended up eating the entire box.

On my way to the dentist, my stomach was very unhappy. I was extremely bloated. The gas came quickly, and I spent the entire drive pushing out what I could, windows down, sweating. I was getting nervous as I parked, hoping it would stop. That’s when I read the box.

They were FIBER BARS.

But it was too late. The hygienist got me set up in the chair, put the nose piece on for the nitrous, and said she’d be right back. I took that as my final fart break and let loose. The smell was so bad I smelled it IMMEDIATELY, even with the nose piece on. The hygienist came back and did a full stop at the doorway before hesitantly proceeding.

Over the next two hours, I emitted a steady stream of toxic waste. I mean two straight hours of hot silent farts. The dentist seemed weirdly unbothered, but the hygienist excused herself several times. Towards the end, she told him “I’m sorry, I just... I can’t” and didn’t come back. He did the fillings while holding the suction hose himself for most of it.

I was so mortified that I didn’t go back there for over a year. When I finally did, I was hoping they’d forgotten. But as soon as I walked in, the hygienist (who also functions as a receptionist) knew my name. I figured she remembered me due to my horrific gas leak, so I apologized. Turns out she didn’t remember the incident, she remembered me because I drool like a Saint Bernard (this is true, it runs down my face, it gets everywhere). She laughed, I died a little inside.

I really like that dentist, so I decided to leave him a good review on Google. It basically summarized what happened and said they were very professional about it.

At my next visit, my dentist mentioned it immediately, laughing about it. He told me he has no sense of smell. He had no idea it even happened. The hygienist had blamed her leaving on a medical issue or something, and didn’t rat me out.

I should have just kept my mouth shut.

TLDR: Ate a whole box of fiber bars before a long dentist appointment, leaked hot farts the entire time, didn’t go back for a while, figured they remembered, turns out dentist didn’t even know and found out from my review.

Edit: Holy crap, I picked the wrong night to forget to charge my phone and this thing got way more attention than anticipated. I am so happy that so many of you got a laugh out of this. Thank you to the people who pointed out that she was a dental assistant rather than a hygienist, I wasn’t really sure what title to use for her when I made the post.

Please forgive me if it's not as organized or set up the way most posts are, I will try my best to make sure it is.

My partner (f16) and I (m16) have been talking for about 2 and a half months, and just over a week ago we both agreed to make things official between us. All in all it's a pretty healthy relationship. Everything has been going pretty good for us so far, other than this one thing, and it has been affecting me quite a lot. The thing is I'm not entirely sure if what I'm referring to should be affecting me the way it is. Maybe my mind is taking it in a way that it shouldn't, or maybe it's perfectly normal for this to be bothering me. I guess I'll just have to find out.

Me and my partner kind of have a ldr but at the same time we don't. You see, we live no more than a 20 minute drive away from each other, but we aren't able to hang out or see each other in person quite yet. There are a couple reasons for this. One of them is because of the pandemic. I signed up for completely remote learning at the begining of school, but I'm not permitted to change my mind and start attending school in person this far into the year. So that would leave hanging out with each other after school hours as another option, right? Well not quite. Her parents have always been immensely strict as well as over protective, and they don't let her have anybody over or let her go over to anybody else's residence. Of course I wish I could see her face to face, but I understand why I can't yet. In time that will change, but as of now there is no way for us to see each other in person, and so we usually ft thoughout the day.

My partner and I both suffer from depression and anxiety, which means we both tend to get fairly sad sometimes.I know one of the main reasons for a relationship is to be there for one another through everything. But everybody has their different ways that they cope, and i've learned that me and my partner cope very differently from each other. You could even say that the ways we cope are complete opposite ways. So what helps me, or at least temporarily distracts me is having someone there with me, someone I can vent to in hopes of just getting everything off of my chest. And what my partner tells me helps her is time away from everyone and everything, including me. When she is depressed she tends to push me away from her. 

Often times we'll be on ft, and I'll notice that something is wrong, and so I ask if anything is. she usually responds with no at first but in time she does admit something is indeed wrong. most of the time she does tell me what is bothering her but she never goes into a lot of detail, because she says she hates to talk about her feelings. after she tells me what is troubling her, she usually says she needs some alone time, and she then leaves the call. 

I'll immediately snap her, often times saying things like ""I'm here for you, I want to help"". And she tends to reply with words like ""I don't want help"". It really hurts me, knowing she doesn't want my help. it makes me feel like she doesn't need me at all, it makes me feel worthless. We continue to snapchat each other after she hangs up, which she allows when she needs alone time, but her responses do take a while when she's upset. I try to take my time and really think out my messages that I send to her, my goal is always to help her feel better with my words of encouragement and assurance but it never seems to work. she never responds with any words back, it's usually a snap of her crying and it breaks my heart to see her like that. but I keep trying, I send her paragraphs among paragraphs trying to say all of the right words, but it never seems to be good enough to help her feel even a little bit better. It makes me feel like a failure. 

After some time passes I'll kindly ask if she's ready to call me back again, and she usually says no. and so I'll respond with ""okay, I understand, I'm right here if you need me"" And that cycle just kind of continues until shes feeling better and calls me back or until she cries herself to sleep.

It all just hurts me so much. I want to be someone she turns to when she's in pain, not someone she turns away from. She says it's the best for her. and yes, of course I want the best for her. I just hate knowing shes all alone breaking down and having panic attacks when I can't do anything to stop it. I haven't told her much about how it me feel when she's pushes me away, I've only said a couple things about it but it's never been as in depth as this.

I'm very worried about her. I'm just not sure what to do, or what the best thing for me to do is. I'm afraid if I try to convince her to confide in me it'll come across as anoyying or controlling, and I don't want to seem like that, because I want her to know she is free to make her own decisions. But if I don't try to convince her to confide in me then there's the possiblity that she may take it as me not caring about her which is not the case at all. I care about her so much and that is the reason I am writing this post. I know I have so many options I can choose from but im not entirely sure which one I should pick. 

I stated this in the second paragraph of this post, but I don't know if all this should be affecting me the way it is. Do you guys think I'm getting too worked up about this? Please be as honest as possible. What do you guys think I should do? I'm very scared to mess anything up, what could I do that would help my situation? I'm writing this fairly late at night so I'm planning to get some rest very shortly after I finish writing this post.

I really enjoy sushi and this quickly became one of my favourite restaurants. When Gabe and I go out for lunch this has become our go-to place. 

I have another friend, “Anna”. We went to high school together and were quite close at that time but have grown apart after graduation due to not seeing each other every day. Anna is difficult to make plans with as she is not great at responding to texts. She lives in a different part of the city from me(about half an hour away) so that does add to the difficulty in making plans, but whenever I’m near where she lives to see a movie or something(pre-covid mostly) I send her a message to invite her, but she doesn’t usually respond until the next day. 

In August 2019, I had plans to get sushi with Gabe and my sister a few days before I left for college. I realized that morning that I hadn’t seen Anna all summer so I sent her a last minute text asking if she wanted to join us. She responded quickly and was available, so she met us at the restaurant and we all had lunch together. While I could tell Anna was happy to be included, I also sensed that the sushi restaurant was not her scene. From the all-you-can-eat sushi menu, all she had was white rice and ice cream. 

Within the past week my area has deemed it safe to reopen restaurants. Gabe and I decided to go for sushi this weekend since we haven’t had the opportunity in months. We even made a reservation(we rarely did this pre-covid) to ensure a table. 

Two days ago Anna came over to my place to catch up. She asked what I’d been up to, and I told her not much but I had plans to have sushi with Gabe. She said “remember the time we all went?” I laughed and said yes, and then the conversation changed topics. 

Here’s where I think I may be TA: Anna texted me this afternoon asking if Gabe and I would be open to her joining us for sushi. I wanted to spend some time with Gabe alone but also didn’t want to be rude, so I told her “Sorry we’ve made a reservation for two” She asked if we could call and change the reservation. I told her we didn’t want to and I didn’t think she enjoyed it last time. She snapped back about how I shouldn’t be bragging about how Gabe and I were going if we weren’t inviting her. I apologized and told her it was never my intention to brag. She left me on read. 

I feel bad because she is my friend and I don’t get to see her often, but I want to spend time with my other friend.

They never really talked in school but they basically talked 24*7 on Snapchat and they got really close. So even tho we’re best friends since we were 10, she didn’t tell me about this guy (she tells me about every single guy who even looks at her) so that was already kinda sus. 

I got to know about this guy in August/September and by then she had already fallen for him and was pretty much obsessed with him. I didn’t like that because 

1. He’s not the kinda guy she would fall for cause she loves being chased but at many points in their relationship, she had to beg him to stay and he still left. 
2. They argue A LOT and he blocks her for days. 3. He ruined her birthday. Literally a week before her birthday, he told her they should go on a break (her birthday is in nov) till Jan and if she agrees to it, they’ll get back together in Jan but if she texts him during their break, he’ll leave her forever and if she does not agree, he’ll leave her right then and this man had the AUDACITY to give her barely one night to make the decision. She agreed for the break but begged him to be there on her birthday but he refused, then texted her a simple “happy birthday”. 

Idr what happened after this but somehow they got back together and they didn’t go on the break. They had a huge fight again last week and he blocked her for a couple of days and just unblocked her recently. I told her I hate him and I don’t think he’s the right guy for her several times but she refuses to believe me. She called me today and when we started talking about him and I told her again i know for sure he’s gonna hurt her, she said “Shut up he won’t. I don’t need negative people like you in my life” and I hung up the call.

We have been together for 5 years. See.. I got into a terrible car accident when I was 14 and was in the hospital for 3 weeks and 5 days recovering. I have been terrified of driving ever since. To a point where I get behind the wheel and immediately get tunnel vision and everything goes blurry. So when my GF got her license at 16, she tried forcing me to go in and get mine but I just wasnt ready. This was the very beginning of our relationship.

She has continued to harp on me over the years to get my license despite the fact that I dont technically even need it. The home I am renting is literally right next door to my work. The grocery store is literally right across the street. Hospital is only a mile away. I can quite literally walk everywhere and I have been doing so since I moved here at age 20. I enjoy this. But she still harped on me, which caused numerous fights. 

Back 3 months ago I went to a buddies house and while there, we ended up having a few drinks. My GF was mad because she made plans for us without me knowing and picked a fight. She ends up going home and drinking (I didnt know this). Later I told her my buddy was drinking so he couldnt drive me home and that I was just going to stay the night. She insisted on coming to get me; again, I had no knowledge that she was drinking. She got pulled over and got a DUI and lost her license for a year. She gave me an ultimatum. Either get my license or shes gone because it was ""my fault"" that she lost her license (I realize it's not but she tries blaming me). Didnt want her to leave so I sucked up my fear and got it. Now she wants me to drive her everywhere. Saying its ""so nice"" that she doesnt have to drive herself around anymore. I told her that's not how it works and I will not be driving her everywhere because as it stands now, I'm still terrified of getting behind the wheel and everything is walking distance.

I trust him less during only my period time, I wake up depressed and overthink events that are impossible, and then something happens where I end up hurting him by accident emotionally or I piss him off to the point where he just doesn’t wanna deal with it. I don’t ever intend for it to happen, and it just usually starts off with me wanting to spend a little more time with him because I get needy during the time of the month. 

He’s been dealing with it for 3 years, bless him, and doesn’t know how much more he can take. The only thing that prevented him from leaving me recently was the time that he put into the relationship. 

I don’t think he’s in the wrong but at the same time I feel like I did make improvements but every time this happens those improvements I made go to waste. At one point I started to go to therapy to see wtf was going on and how can I handle it.

Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

Ever since the end of graduation I've been exploring my sexuality in ways in which I couldn't have with my prototypical conservative parents. Exhibitionism has always seemed exciting to me but I never really thought about it because the idea seemed kinda crazy and wild to me; recently though I saw one of those videos of a girl sharing her stats from her OF, and girl, she made more money in 1 month than I could have hoped for in 3 (especially with COVID-19) and so I started thinking about it. I mean whats to lose? If I'm into and I stand to make a lot of money, whats the problem?

I made the account but haven't uploaded anything yet, mostly because my best friend of a year (lets call her Sarah), didn't exactly approve. She was telling me that I stand to ruin my career (I'm a PA) because my employer could see it, and that it was glorified pornography. I told Sarah that no one would really see it and if my boss or patients did see, that it had nothing to do with my value as a PA.

I experienced a fair amount of abuse as a child, from my mom and her then-husband. She and I were estranged for nearly 2 decades because repeated attempts by me to reach out and forge a new relationship, were constantly met with denial, defensiveness, and more abuse. 

During the first visit with her in several years, she shared with me that she’s terrified of dementia. She has heavy memory issues and would often be mean with me when she’d struggle to remember something. She accused me of letting her suffer and enjoying it, when the reality is I was giving her the space to figure it out on her own. 

TIFU:
A week later, a bottle of wine lubed the cogs of conversation. I saw an opportunity to share my experiences of childhood. She immediately denied it all. 

I said, “You shared you’ve been experiencing memory issues, is it possible you remember things differently than they happened?”

She actually conceded for the first time. She said she was open to maybe having blocked it all out and remembering differently than what happened.

Later she told me she felt hurt about my bringing up her memory issue. I recognized what occurred, immediately acknowledged it, and apologized. 

In the moment, I saw the memory issue as an in, to get her to listen, to just be open to consider the possibility of a different perspective - for the first time ever. There was no malice, I simply did not have the forethought to notice what I was doing. She was vulnerable with me for the first time, and I unfairly used it against her. 

Fortunately we got past it easily and she has been opening up since. She says she prefers this way of open and honest communication. 
Go figure...

Not that we have plans to be wed, but that we met after both going through divorces and quickly started cohabitating. We purchased a house together and co-parent a dog. I think that the loss we each felt from the failure of our respective marriages helped propel us to act faster than was wise.  

My girlfriend is a wonderful human. She is supportive of me, gives a lot of herself to others, is moral, has compatible political views,is intelligent, and loves animals  We have had some challenges lately finding common interests. I'm a computer guy and also a musician. I like to hike and sail. She initially liked to do a lot of stuff with me but stopped after a couple of years. I was left with the idea that she was going with the flow for the sake of the relationship.  

The big problem is that she gets angry with me at the drop of a hat. It always seems like an inappropriate amount of anger for the situation and she says that she thinks it comes from not being able to let go of times she has been hurt in the past by me and others. We went through a few years of couples counselling and it helped for awhile, but we seem to be in a place where she gets angry about something a couple times a week. 

This evening, she got mad at me while we were playing chess. I have played a bit since I was young but started reading more lately.  One of the new things that I picked up was the ""en passant"" rule. While playing earlier tonight, she makes a move creating the situation that the rule speaks to. I didn't think it would be very nice to just take her piece for a rule that she probably wasn't aware of, so I ask her, are you aware of the en passant rule? I explain what it is and ask her if she wants to take her move back and try something else. She surprises me with her anger telling me to just take her fucking piece. I tried to explain that I was trying to be nice by sharing what I had learned and giving her an opportunity to make a different move, but she kept getting more angry and said that I was being condescending and pedantic. She obviously saw my attempts as a slight against her.  I went to another part of the house and she came and apologized a couple hours later. 

This, by itself, is nothing. It's just stupid. But similar dynamics happen every few days. After a blow up last weekend, she said that she would call a counselor that she used to see and talk to him, but then she didn't call him this week and got angry with me when I asked if she had.  

I feel like this anger and these fights, while worse lately, has been going on to some degree or another for most of our relationship. I wish I could just deal with it without getting hurt but I am not able.  I feel like at 57, I should be wiser that I am about relationships. I am also feeling old and the thought of dividing up the house and household items, and then starting back out on my own again seems really depressing right now. I'm trying to weigh tranquility and the chance for maybe something better in the future versus stability and security.

My SIL is smart and principled, but also pretty rigid. I love that she speaks her mind, but I also think she oversteps regularly with the idea that she's doing the right thing.

A little background -- My SIL married my bother five years ago and was excited to spend time with our family when visiting from the east coast. She grew up as the only child in an unstable home and was really into the idea of our family holiday gatherings, having siblings by marriage, and, I guess, having her fantasy of a stable family fulfilled. She was so excited, in fact, that she and my brother relocated from the east coast to our hometown hundreds of miles away when the opportunity presented itself. The conflicts started when her fantasy of our family collided with reality.

SIL has repeatedly pulled me aside and chastised me for not having the relationship with my parents that she wants me to have. For example, I don't go on family trips with my parents because we have different definitions of fun and relaxing. I also prefer to see my parents the day after Christmas rather than sleep over and spend Christmas morning at their house -- it's logistically easier and more relaxing to open presents with our kid at home rather than shlepping everything and everyone across town. I used to write the gripes off as disappointment over unmet expectations and they didn't bother me much. I started taking her unsolicited advice more seriously when she had some harsh words to say to me about pursuing fertility treatments.

The shorthand is that, for my husband and I to have kids, we definitely needed help. When she asked me privately about our plans for having a family (I thought that was a safe topic with her since she's so into family, whoops),  I told her the truth. She told me point blank that fertility treatments are a mistake and we should just adopt. After that incident, I made a point to keep my distance from her and stick to water cooler topics. Soon after that conversation, the fertility treatments worked, however my SIL stopped talking to me and my husband. SIL is the social coordinator for my brother, so I doubt he noticed the sudden lack of texts, phone calls, and visits. SIL only resumed speaking to me three weeks before our son was born, when she made several generous but overstepping offers to help us (ex. staying overnight to help with the baby). I thanked her for her enthusiasm but told her we had it covered. Despite living a short drive away, SIL and my brother didn't bother coming over to see our new baby until he was two months old and I invited them to a party at our place. Yeah, I was really hurt by all that, especially with SIL being so into family and togetherness. Despite all of this, I was able to keep up the water cooler talk and thought we had reached some level of peace if not closeness. Wrong! I recently posted a photo of my son on Facebook and now SIL is back in my business and I need some advice.

My sweet son is now 18 months old and able to use a rocking chair that I've had since I was a child. The chair is painted black with green and gold accents and has some pink flowers on the headrest - very sweet! This rocking chair has been passed down through five prior generations of my family and my son makes it the sixth generation. All the prior owners have been girls through sheer luck of birth order or hoarding tendencies. Growing up, the chair was a fixture in my bedroom and my mom made sure to get the rocking chair to my house as soon I moved in several years ago. I've been storing it for our future kids ever since. I had the idea of taking a picture of my son in this teeny, 150 year old chair and posting it on facebook along with pictures of other wee family members sitting in it over the years. Well, SIL saw the photos and immediately started raising a ruckus.

She reached out to me about giving the chair to her for her two young daughters since it's a ""family piece"" and is really for girls. She's even attempted to rope my parents into this. They wisely are staying out of it, but boy am I tempted to tell her where to get off. This feels like a shameless grab at something she wants from a parent and child she doesn't like. No amount of reasoning with her (it's mine, I've stored and maintained it, my son is enjoying it) seems to persuade her. I'm ok with her not liking me, since it frankly seems like we are already there. I really worry about my brother though. He's also choosing to stay out of it and I made the choice long ago to not tattle on SIL for all the pull-aside lectures and unsolicited advice. I have no idea if he's tried to reason with SIL or if he's aware of her regular badgering. On the few occasions he's seen her raise a concern with me about more trivial matters, like sleeping over at my parent's house for the holidays, he's generally backed her up and asked me to relent because it's important to SIL. I can't imagine being close to SIL but the distance I've created with her has also created distance with him.

So, the advice I am looking for is how to keep SIL at bay while still getting to have a relationship with my brother. Should I loop him in on what's going on? How do I talk about creating boundaries with her without letting loose on how much I don't want to be around her and dislike her unrealistic expectations.

TL;DR: SIL has unrealistic expectations about how our family should function and seems to have a particular dislike for my son since he's the product of fertility treatments. She found out that I have an heirloom piece of children's furniture and is making a case that I should give it to her kids rather than let my son use it.

Lootbox mechanics, buggy games, boring storylines,  copy-pasted mechanics to games that may not need them (open world, crafting, stealth gameplay, etc.) are surface level problems caused in part by the brainlessness of a dominant marketing department, but this is also caused by the willingness of hardcore gamers to buy substandard AAA games.

If they would like better games, they will have to stop buying early access, wait for nonbiased reviews, and stop believing hype that AAA companies spread.  This will punish companies for producing low-quality

But gamers will have to make a sacrifice as well. They also have to be prepared to wait longer for games, so that companies have time to produce games of quality.

I'm a 16 year old male student. Ever since grade 7 I've been loving this girl like crazy. Though shortly after, she got a boyfriend. They where since then having  a huge on-off relationship. Every now and again her boyfriend would tell her to block me 'cause we had too good of a friendship in his eyes. After they broke up for the last time so far, she had been blocking me for roughly 4 months. Then, she texted me again deeply apologizing for everything  and that she'd like to meet me. I was pissed af still, but I felt like I got over her. When I read the message tho, I knew, fuck I'm all into her again. So we met up for roughly 4 weeks regularly and then she suddenly started texting less and less until we then never met up again 'cause she ""never had time"". One day, I found out that she in fact got back together with the guy and it was blindly ovious to me that this was the reason she wasn't texting me. I feel like I missed my chance, in retrospect. Weirdly enough, she still texts me every few days for no real reason, which kinda makes the impression that she likes me. Btw, we go to different schools since summer last year. Her boyfriend is not in the same school though. 

Here I am still hoping for this girl to love me one day. I basically tear up daily thinking about her having another boy and not loving me. I am in a deep struggle:

So after you've gotten a little context here, I would like to propose my question. Should I 

1) Let this girl go and try to somehow move on

2) Tell her my feelings

3) Try to stay friends with her 

My thoughts on 1): I feel like I'd loose a really really awesome friendship and I think we would both be sad as shit. But I think it might be necessary for me to move on, because I have these struggles everydays that really screw with my life quality and sanity.

My thoughts on 2)  The last time I did this (a year ago), she told me it was cute but then told her boyfriend who told her to block me for good. I think our relationship has gotten to the point where she doesn't do something like that to me, though I am not sure and have the fear of losing her through this. I heard that this would be better than hoping for her to break up with him one day and getting back to me, as this is unlikely to happen.

My thoughts on 3) This is honestly what I prefer. I really think she is amazing and that we maybe, just maybe could stay friends. But my big problem is that this is probably gonna fuck my mind like crazy. Everytime she'd breakup again (maybe) and tell me how bad her boyfriend is, I'll develop hopes again and get heartbroken again. 

I really don't know what to do, please help me

My mum (43F) knows I self-harm, but not how much.

A while ago, I tried to quit. I did everything right, IMO, I even made an action plan

But it was hard. My symptoms got worse. I was more suicidal, had more panic attacks, I spent many breaks in the toilet as I just couldn’t deal with going out on the field. I’d given up a very effective coping mechanism, so I felt really bad, on the verge of a mental breakdown.

After a month or so, I weighed the pros and cons of it all, and I made the decision to give up. Staying alive and staying functional are my first priorities, and if quitting self-harm would endanger that I wouldn’t do it. Instead, I will focus on getting better, and as the need to self-harm disappears, so should the self-harm itself (so far, this is working, I’ve gone from every day to roughly every other day) I discussed this with my therapist, and they agreed that this was the right choice.

The thing is, my mum disagrees. She pushes quitting immediately as the right choice in all situations involving self-harm, not really considering all the other factors, just “self-harm = bad , ‘ , quit”

On top of that, she tends to be a bit bitchy whenever she notices I’ve self-harmed. Not intentionally, she really wants what’s best for me. But she doesn’t really get how self-harm works, so she often says that self-harming is “very stupid”.

I tried to explain my decision to her, but she was not on board, even when I explained I have the support of my therapist. She just said my therapist was stupid, and tried to force me to try quitting again.

Therefore, I’ve decided to mostly hide my self-harm from her.

Am I making the right decision?

I felt so degraded and hurt and when I tried to explain to her that yes, what happened to me was rape and the probmlems I have today is because of that, she basically told me that I had no right to say I had been raped since I was never penetrated and I should have no problem going to the gynecologist and that my psychologist lied to me.

I am a bisexual woman with more preference towards women. Generally I am (or was) really in touch with my sexuality and love this kind of intimacy. I'm first person to give you sex advice and advocate for knowing your body and giving it pleasure both with partner(s) or by yourself and I take big pleasure in both mine and my partner's orgasms so I know I am not asexual.

 I'm in relationship with my partner(23f) for about 9 months and we have are generally very physical. Cuddling, hand holding, etc. all kinds of non sexual touch create no problems at all. We also have sex sometimes but it is quite underwhelming on my part because I keep getting in wrong headspace and just can't let go and stop thinking too much. What brings me to two of my exes who I think unintentionally broke me and I can't figure out what to do with it.

First of the two exes (let's call her Ginny) has been in relationship with me for about two years. I was 20 and she was 19 at the time when we started to date. As it turned out she was a survivor of sexual abuse as a child and developed DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder, previously called Multiple Personality Disorder) Ginny had 6 personalities in total but that in itself was not a problem. I was just dating one of them and the rest were friendly with me, 3 of them underage and they were kind of like younger siblings to me. Problem was with one of them that kind of kept the trauma of being sexually abused and tried to deal with it by recreating the scenario. Meaning, one person in Ginny's body that was underage and acted like a child was attempting to touch me sexually, usually when we were falling asleep and then continued to be upset if I didn't let them touch me. Which I didn't because it would be fucked up since it was a child, or a part Ginny's psyche that didn not develop beyond age of more or less 5. She also did not remember anything that this personality did. On top of that few times when we did have sex she got triggered and one of the children popped up, either playful or absolutely distraught. Now, I was 20 so I did not realise then how fucked up this whole situation was. 

Situation with other ex(32f) was less messed up. We broke up right before I met my current partner. She was asexual and generally weird about physical touch and we were together for 8 months mostly because I was too busy with uni to break up with her earlier. Anyways being unable to touch her or have sex with her also made me evenore scared of touching someone sexually becaue she didn't want me to touch her body at all (issues with dysmorphia).

Now, my partner is lovely beautiful woman that I'm attracted to sexually. She is also survivor of sexual abuse but at later time what translates in not being a fan of penetrative sex but other than that everything should work with us fine. Only it is not, because I have a massive blockade in my brain about touching her sexually because I'm afraid I'm gonna trigger her and hurt her accidentally like I've done to Ginny.

My current partner knows about my previous exes and my issues with them but I didn't give her too much detail because it is kind of weird to talk about my sex life with my exes with partner that is still kind of fresh.

Now before you suggest talking to therapist, yes, I'm on a waitlist right now. 

Any thoughts? I am really desperate to figure out how to deal with it asap.

TL/DR: I dated person who had multiple personalities and got triggered by having sex with me and an asexual girl who hated herself. Now I'm scared to have sex with my current partner even though we both want to.",0,0,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,self,My(24f) exes still are in my sex life and I hate it.,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/l9gtw7/my24f_exes_still_are_in_my_sex_life_and_i_hate_it/,all_ads,3.0

For example, it would be great if more Amtrak trains would run, especially in places that only get three Amtrak trains a week each direction (Sunset Limited operates 6 times a week and runs between Los Angeles, CA and New Orleans, LA, formerly to Orlando, FL, and it would be great if they would reextend to Orlando!)

But this is more specifically about Arizona. Not only should there be commuter rail service between Tucson and Phoenix, something that's just talked about but not executed, but there should also be a passenger rail line from Tucson to Nogales following the existing Union Pacific Nogales Branch. It would also be great if there was passenger rail to Sierra Vista via Benson, and perhaps extending from Sierra Vista to Douglas and perhaps Bisbee.

Stops between Tucson and Nogales would include Sahurita, Green Valley, Tubac, and Rio Rico. 

I know Sierra Vista is a small town but it's the largest city in Cochise County, they even have a mall there that fully opened in 2000. And the town seems to be getting bigger. I still think Sierra Vista can and should have passenger rail, including connections to Tucson. I for one would ride a train from Tucson to Sierra Vista or Sierra Vista to Tucson, and others should have that option. Amtrak isn't needed but more like a state railroad like Metrolink, Caltrain, Coaster, ACE, and SMART all California passenger/commuter trains.

Or if not commuter rail, an excursion or tourist train in Sierra Vista.

It be nice to have the option to take trains through more of Arizona than already done (Amtrak, Grand Canyon Railway and Verde Canyon. There was also San Pedro and Southwestern Railroad but it was discontinued and the tracks from Curtiss to Paul Spur were removed in 2007.)

Arizona should have more passenger rail, be it an increase in Amtrak trains, adding of commuter trains, adding or extending light rail and streetcars (Phoenix has Light Rail as of 2008 and Tucson has a streetcar system as of 2014. There's also talk of getting commuter rail in Phoenix and surrounding towns and suburbs like Tempe, Mesa, Surprise, Glendale, Buckeye, Queen Creek, etc.) Would have also been nice to have light rail in Tucson!

As for rail to Sierra Vista, stops would include Rita Ranch, Vail, Mescal (f), Benson, St. David, Curtiss, Whetstone (f,) Huachuca City, and Sierra Vista. (f) means ""Flag Stop"" where trains only stop on passenger's request, there is something like that in Hudson Lake, Indiana. I'd include Tombstone if it wasn't so far east!

And perhaps an extension from Sierra Vista to Douglas via Hereford or Sierra Vista Southeast, Palominos, Naco, Bisbee (perhaps,) and Double Adobe or Pirtlville, and many of the stops would be Flag Stops as well. Service would be limited though.

If only train riding was more popular in the United States and if only more people wanted to ride trains!

But she got mad at me when I wasn't as supportive as she hoped for. I was supportive do not get me wrong one bit, but she expected more and never voiced it. But afterwards she got really angry despite all of the support I was giving to her. 

My ex told me I was not supportive of her, despite all my efforts. I didn't meet her expectations when she needed me, yet she never voiced them and then left me despite the attempts I did make to support her.

Now she broke up with me and our 5 year relationship because by not supporting her like she expected, she is worried it will happen again and thus she cannot trust me to not ""break her heart"" again by not supporting her in the way she expected. She felt I broke her heart because she made assumptions and those didnt happen.

Is it realistic to live up to every expectation a partner may have? And why would she be so quickly willing to drop a 5 year relationship over not being supported a few times?

I am emotionally supportive, physically, etc. Weekly dates, close to her family, wanting to progress our relationship, telling her I love her and showing it, etc. But where I messed up was when she was dealing with traumatic moments this last year, she expected so much from me and I was truly trying. But she was not voicing everything and even her codependency was a struggle because like I said it seemed like the support I was giving and showing her was never enough for her. 

She told me, when I needed you the most you werent there for me and it was like I was drowning in the water reaching out for you. But the reality of the situation... I was there. Like legitimately I was. The outcome or expectation she had just wasn't met and thus she said that. Because of that she legit made it seem like I was not supportive to her at all.

I  (M28) recently ended a relationship with a girlfriend (F36) a couple  months ago and tried to be friends with her for a couple months after.  We both had issues that we needed to work on for ourselves, and I was  hoping that we'd be able to grow and heal together. Unfortunately, that  was idealistic and it didn't work out that way. I felt it was best that  we cut ties (non-mutual) since we were both hurting each other more than  helping. At a certain point, I felt I had to no contact because if I  re-initiated contact again, we would fall back into the same harmful  patterns. It's been a bit over a month now, and I still miss them, but  can't trust that we can keep in touch as friends without her trying to  seduce me. The last time we were in contact was wishing each other a  happy new year.

Thinking back upon  our whole relationship for about 6 months (2 months in person + 4  months ldr), I can't tell if I was just being used for sex or some  ego-supply and it kills me whenever I think about it. We use to spend  hours talking/texting every day, but looking at them, almost all our  conversations were for her benefit and she rarely asked or showed  interest in me. The only times she seemed to care about me were when I  was either busy with work, studying, or when she was horny. At the time,  I felt I was trying to be supportive and trying to give her space to  heal, but now I feel like I was just being used. What feels worse, is  the fact that she might've cheated on me during our time together or at  least it was hinted. I can't tell if she was narcissistic, but from what  I've reflected upon, there were a lot of signs of it.

I  know I'm probably making her sound like a monster, but talking with her  about her childhood and past has given context which does explain a lot  of the behaviour (coping mechanisms), and probably why I tried to be  there for her as long as I could. I don't regret us being together for  the time we spent, as I learned a lot about myself and where I can  improve, however the pain is still there. The thought that I might have  not meant anything to her beyond mere supply hurts beyond belief. Not a  day goes by that I don't think about this, and I feel I can't really  open up to those around me about what I'm going through, based on past  times of sharing personal issues. It certainly doesn't help the fact  that our world is locked down, and I feel really lonely.

Maybe I'm just writing into the darkness, but I'm wondering if anyone has any experiences that might shed light on my situation.

It's the second PTA movie I've seen, the first being There Will Be Blood, which is one of the best movies I've ever seen and easily one of the best movies this century imo. Magnolia is wildly ambitious, but for me it was a big swing and a big miss. I can't really understand the level of praise it gets.

Firstly, I really think the movie just tries to do too much. There are simply too many characters, and I didn't start connecting with any of them until like half way through. Even then, I didn't connect with many of them. Some of them were straight up annoying, such as Julianne Moore's character. Jesus christ. She was the same over the top hysterical in every scene.

And this brings me onto another point. The actors are excellent, but all their talent is just misguided in this. I couldn't tell if characters were supposed to be satirically over the top or realistic and serious, and they seemed to flick between both. This matters, because the film relies on you being able to empathise with a characters childhood trauma which supposedly explains their current state. But for example look at Tom Cruise's character. He's so over the top and laughable initially that it really doesn't work when the film flips to super serious and tries to make us empathise with him. He's portrayed as an over the top caricature initially and it's impossible to just shake that. Also I normally hate this phrase, but I really think some of the actors were just overacting at times, and it just came off as over the top and awkward.

I do think this movie explores themes that interest me. The idea that random people you interact with all have their own complex lives and issues is interesting. Just seeing this array of characters all going through the trials of life together is a beautiful idea but it looses me in the execution for the reasons I've already explained. Honestly, a film that did some of this stuff better in my eyes is Rear Window. Obviously it's nowhere near as ambitious as magnolia, but whereas Magnolia bites off more than it can chew, Rear Window is a beautifully self contained and well packaged movie. It does not explore the lives of different characters to nearly the same extent, as we only see their lives through the eyes of the main protagonist watching them in their homes. But the central characters in that are what hold the whole movie and give it structure, and what we see of the other characters is subtle and measured yet impactful.

Magnolia often lacked direction and felt structureless, lacked subtly, was overly ambitious, bloated, and I simply can't understand the praise.

We have a healthy relationship and are able to talk through our issues without any issues and genuinely like each other. 

Last week, my girlfriend got distant, and one day stoped messaging me completely. I thought this might be due to some stress in her life, as she’s going through a lot at the moment, but when we talked later that night she told me she didn’t understand what was going on with her feelings. 

She’s never been in a long term relationship and doesn’t know what’s supposed to happen next. She says that she still really likes me but not to the extent she did when we first met. She made it very clear she didn’t want to break up, and that she wanted to figure this out. She didn’t even want to go on a break until I suggested we take a week off with no contact with set boundaries , which were in now. 

I’m kind of conflicted on where I am at. A part of me thinks that she doesn’t understand that leaving the lovey dovey / honeymoon stage of a relationship is completely normal and happens (I came to this conclusion as she said she still really likes me, and have been in that situation myself). I understand that you get familiar with someone and you can’t go through the exploration phase forever. Everyone I’ve asked has told me that this is the problem and that it’ll work itself out. However, I also think she may be scared to break up or has really lost feelings, and I don’t want to beat a dead horse. 

Where do you guys think she’s at? Is this just her leading about life after the honeymoon stage or is she actually losing feelings 

tl:dr
Gf still likes me but not to same extent as when we started dating.

There were a few reasons but let’s just say we weren’t on the same page about what we wanted in our futures. 

I slept with this guy (E) super unexpectedly who I ended up having weirdly strong feelings for, I thought he was the one. We hung out in the same circle of friends and only hooked up a few times but I can’t forget him and I feel this unrequited love is karma for my ex. Im miserable and embarrassed when I think about how everything happened. I hate thinking about him because I mean nothing to him.

Things don’t get much better from there... I’m entertaining a dom (K) who I really like and in a text relationship with another guy I also really like (M). My gut tells me having a dom is for fun and to explore my sexuality and personal growth but sometimes I imagine what more could be. I have no idea what to do with the guy I’m texting - he won’t meet up or call me and has only invited me to his house which sends a casual hook up impression. He texts me everyday and we have a vibe going but that’s as far as it goes. 

I want to learn from my mistakes with E in case M could be bf potential and not sleep with him, keep my boundaries and self-worth intact cuz I saw how low I let them go for E and have been actively working on improving my self-esteem. What’s worst is I immediately felt M was my chance to redeem myself from E because they kinda have a similar look. I’m still not over E and feel pathetic about it, I romanticized the whole thing but can’t shake it.

Whats wrong with me? Am I just stupid and falling into infatuation with every guy I meet? My ex is still in love with me and has been working hard to be a better man, solid and all to be with me and win me back.

I feel me and my ex are soulmates but something about the relationship makes me feel like I’m settling and want something more. I even tried dating him again to see if I made a mistake. It felt good in the beginning but again lost that feeling and I don’t want to play games with him if the right thing is to let him go and move on.

I feel so down on myself and like I can’t make good choices. I just feel so lost and terrified and sad.

(ex. Samantha = sam or sammy). This has always bothered me but I would usually just try to reintroduce the name I wanted to be called instead (like leaving voice messages, ect). But it doesn't seem to matter usually after a few times one of the nick names stuck and I was introduced to their friends woth one of the nick names. I have no issues with others having nick names and will gladly call anyone what they want to be called. I just don't like the nick names for my name. 

Last week I met a friend of a friend and I introduced myself by my full fist name. After the introduction she shortened my name to the equivalent of Sammy the second time she said it. I really annoyed me that she didn't even know me for 5 mins and was changing my name. Unfortunately there was really no way to correct her without making it awkward and calling her out in front of other people. Plus who wants to talk longer with a mask on more than necessary! 

When I was telling a friend how much it annoyed me ,she said it was ridiculous to be bothered by it and everyone uses nick names because it is easier and faster.

We’ve known each other for about 10-11 years, but didn’t really become friends until 5-6 years ago. We’ve talked on and off over the years, but never anything too serious and  I’ve never been able to tell if the feeling’s mutual. We both have similar interests (music, tennis, movies, tv shows, etc.) so conversations are usually pretty natural. I feel like I can be myself around her (pre-COVID) and conversations don’t feel forced. 

Whenever we talk, I feel like I can just be myself and talk about the things that actually interest me. We usually talk about how our lives have been or anything else that may come up. For a while we would just take a bunch of those buzzfeed online quizzes and other personality quizzes and share the results with each other (we’d usually end up with a lot of the same results). Whenever we play tennis with our other friends, we are always doubles partners. We usually don’t win but we usually have fun just playing together. Along with that we usually share music, movies, and TV shows we watch and what we recommend for each other. 

However, I feel that I am always the person starting the conversations, and whenever she does respond, it’s usually a while after I’ve reached out. Time will pass by without hearing anything, but then she’ll respond hours later, usually with double or triple texts. We’re both busy between school and our own lives, so I’m not sure if these delays are unintentional or intentional. 

The issue I’m having is whether or not I’m romanticizing our friendship. Things have pretty much been the same over the last 4 years and I’m not sure what to do. She’s a great friend and an amazing person. I’m just afraid that if I ask her on a date, she’ll say no and things would become weird between us and ultimately our friend group.

When I first moved out of home I’d walk to the local supermarket and buy up packs of Vodka Cruisers and fill my fridge with them. I loved the various flavours and colours - orange and red, green and yellow, purple and blue. 
I started drinking only one or two a day, but quickly progressed to drinking half a dozen. One for breakfast, one mid morning, one at lunch, one mid afternoon, and two at dinner. 

My parents frequently had to help me pay my bills as I was spending all my money on alcohol. 

I used to wake up at 3am and skull half a bottle, then go to work at 5am. 

I drank so much I became ill. After a gastroscopy I found that my stomach lining had become severely inflamed. I was told there were two possible causes - excessive alcohol consumption or eating a lot of spicy food. My mother was in the room with me so of course I couldn’t come clean and admit that I’d done this to myself.

It took me another couple of months for me to work up the determination to ditch the booze. All the bottles went in the trash. My fridge was empty.

So began the hardest days of my life. I had to take days of work to deal with the effects of going cold turkey. The cramps, the cold sweats, the headaches...it was like my body was telling me that I NEEDED a drink to feel better. 
Eventually, after about a week, the pain started to subside, but the cravings did not.

The hardest part was having to go shopping at the supermarket when the liquor department was right next door. The colours of those Vodka Cruisers kept calling me. I felt the taste of them on my tongue constantly. 
Today I feel the taste of red wine on my tongue. I can smell it often. I used to mix red wine with lemonade to make it pink. 

It took years for the cravings to lessen. I still have them but I can control them. I’ve never had a relapse. 
I’ve come to understand that the reason I relied so heavily on alcohol was possibly to (subconsciously) try and rid the memories of being molested as a young child, and assaulted when I was a teenager. I’ve learned that there are other ways of coping with the pain. 

To this day no one in my family knows about my struggle. I’ve never told them. I probably never will. I see no reason to. This was my struggle, not theirs.

I hope this question isn't also disallowed.

I've already 'met' someone. We did a date on zoom a couple of days ago, and in spite of everything it went really well and we both agreed to a second date this Friday. But I don't just want to do another sit down in front of a screen and make small talk thing. I usually do some activity or outing on second dates. How can we simulate this, or at least do something that isn't just a video call from our bedrooms?

Also, is this even a viable way of beginning any kind of relationship at all? Even if we have a dozen more dates I won't be able to hold her hand or kiss her. I am worried that it's not really possible to romantically escalate things when you can't even meet in person. Not touching is bad enough, but even a date where you a socially distanced would be better than nothing, but we can't even do that.

TL;DR what are some 'remote' date ideas, and how do you keep a potential romance going when you haven't met yet and might not be able to meet for a while, or is it impossible?

I am grateful for my parents and everything they’ve done for me throughout my life. They’ve provided a comfortable life without having to worry financially, but I work and have a career of my own in a respectable field, so please read this through because there’s more to it than just the title (imo). 

We live in California in a high cost of living area. My parent bought their house back in the late 1980s so the property tax on the house is still “low” about $6k annually. The value of the house appreciated a lot in the last 30 years and my parents have told me that they’d like for me to inherit the house when they pass, hopefully a long time from now. 

California passed Prop 19 last Nov. which changes how property tax is assessed on inherited property. Prop 19 comes in law next month. Before prop 19, when property is inherited, the property tax value is also inherited, meaning the that the property tax stays the same. However, after prop 19 becomes law, this changes. The property will be reassessed to market value, so the property tax will jump to about $26k a year for the house my parents want me to inherit. The way “around” this is for my parents to transfer the property before prop 19 comes into affect next month. 

My dad thinks it’s a good idea to transfer the house now if we still can (it may be too late due to paperwork process times). However, my mom doesn’t want to. Her logic is that she needs security that she’ll have a house to live in cause she’s concerned that I’d kick her out, which I would never do. The thought of that didn’t cross my mind as a “risk.” 

I’ve been upset with my mom because of this. Her insecurities (a whole other issue itself) will result in about an additional $20k/year in property tax if I want to hold on to the house after they pass. I’d eventually live in it, but there’s definitely a period in which I wont. I like the house and see myself raising a family in it, but that additional amount of property tax makes a big difference financially. There are other options like selling the house when they pass and not deal with property taxes but that’s a whole other thing. The house would be more valuable to me than the money (I’m aware of the tax benefits to selling but that’s a whole other thing). Anyways, it’s the house my sister and I grew up in and that my parents worked for, so keeping it for generations would be my preferred route. 

It just seems like a no brainer to me to take the opportunity to keep the property tax lower, but at the same time I feel like I’m arguing with my mom like a spoiled brat. I should be able to afford the prop tax payments, but not easily, without factoring in having a family. AITA?

TLDR: If my parents transfer the house they want me to inherit before mid-Feb, it’d save about $18k per year in property taxes. My dad wants to but my mom doesn’t.

One of my coworkers is really weirdly jealous of everyone around me. I try to stay friendly with everyone, but theres maybe only one person Id call a friend outside of the workplace.

No matter whether its my significant other, other coworkers, or my friends, he gets snarky and snappy with me. If I have a good weekend, he gets snarky and whiny. If I set boundaries, he gets snarky.

He constantly complains about not being able to have a meaningful long relationship like mine, but hes always whining about how women ""just don't understand him"" and that ""women are unreadable"" and stuff like that.

Hes always lying and telling stories that definitely didn't happen, almost entirely weird white savior stories (ex. "" I told these black kids once -whatever dumb stereotypical bull crap he chooses this time- and they told me they never knew that and that I forever changed my life"") often followed up with ""I'm obviously not racist, right?""

He acts like he deserves anything and everything and that he's entitled to everyones time, but it's 1000x worse with me. I actually hate him. Im so tired of it.

He lies about grandeur things he literally could not have done because he wasn't born or was like, 1 year old at the time. All the while expecting everyone to believe it. God forbid I call him out on his bull, cause then he just goes on rants and gets all snarky with me again.

In other words, even if you explain kids exactly how credit work, they will still get themselves in trouble elsewhere if they don't understand how to use basic logic and draw conclusions to understand consequences to their actions. I think Ponzi schemes were a great example: even people who knew exactly how banking system works aka financially literate folks, would fall for it because they didn't really understand the principle behind money.

For anyone struggling with the same thoughts, doubts or feelings that I have. 

Does she do the things for you that I did? Does she cook for you, know you, calm you? Is she your peace like I was? Does she make you feel safe the way I did? Does she take care of the animals so you aren’t late for work? Does she ache to be close to you like I did? Can you be you around her like you could be with me? Does she listen and not judge like I did? Can she make you think differently? Challenge your mind? Does she fuck like I did? Give head like I did? Can a look or touch from her stir your blood? 

I ask my self these questions every day since you told me there was someone else. I ask why I wasn’t enough, why what we had wasn’t enough? Was it too much to fast? Did I scare you away for being who I am? Did you think you weren’t good enough or that you were making a mistake? What is it about her that makes her better than I am? Why does she get to have what made me happy?we weren’t meant to be forever and I get that. But why do I always end up being chosen second. Why am I good as a back up but not for the whole thing? This has been my question for years. Not in just this one situation. We had a few short weeks and it was great, I wanted to see where it would and could go. You had other plans. I can almost forget about the text message to her you sent to me. I feel like I’m doing well, then all this creeps back up over a fucking text. 

I am adjusting to the friends dynamic we have, it’s great and I do love it. But god damn it fucking hurts. I feel my self wanting to be petty and snide, when at the end I’m just not built that way. I want you to be happy, I want you to get what you want out of life. I want you to find you and I want to be by your side to watch it happen even as a friend. You are amazing! Don’t sell your self short.  You are one of my best and closest friends. I love you. 

The pain and hurt I feel is real. It is valid. Maybe it’s because its my my thoughts, feelings, doubts and insecurities. That doesn’t make them any less valid. I one day will ask the questions or perhaps show this thread. But until I get to where I need to be to have the answers to what I am asking I will be the “friend”

Back when I was around 9 years old (I've forgotten), I was playing catch with my brother, who was \~2 years younger than me. Being little kids, we became bored after under 5 minutes, and started looking for other ways of entertainment. As the smart kids we were, we found the perfect source. ""Let's try to throw the baseball over our house!"" Sadly, our arms were not yet up to the task, and the ball kept rolling back down the sloping roof. It seemed like the house was laughing at our futile attempts. But me, being the Einstein I was, had a wonderful idea. Of course! The secret was to go further back, so I don't have to throw the ball as high! I walked back a few paces, cocked my arm, and released. But alas, I wasn't as accurate as 9 year old me thought I was. The baseball curved down, down, down.....right into a conveniently placed window, which promptly shattered in response. I swear, the sound could've been heard for miles. My mom came hurrying down, fearing that we were hurt. She, following our dumbstruck gaze, caught sight of the ruined window...

Long story short, I was not allowed to use any devices for over a month, and my parents kept a very strict watch when I was outside for quite a few years after that. Thankfully, only the outside pane of the double-pane window broke, meaning there was no need to replace the window (we didn't have visitors often.)

Hi guys 1st time posting and I'm on mobile so sorry if I'm not doing this right. 

So background info. I come from a lower middle class family in the US. My parents divorced when i was 3 and myself and my 4 siblings (3 older 1 younger) have always lived with my dad.
I am the only child that wanted to go to college. 
Long story short even with financial aid and scholarships i was about 20k short to go to the only, and cheapest, school that had my major. (This was just tuition cost not room and board)
My dad said he couldnt help. I didnt ask my mom because we weren't that close.
My new plan was to work and hopefully have enough money to go to school the following year. 
I was visiting my mom and told her how disappointed i was to not be able to go to school right away. My mom couldnt believe i wasn't able to go. I assumed she knew from talking with my dad. She offered to apply for the Parent Plus Loan to cover the extra money. I told her, ""Mom you know that this loan is only under your name. It is not a cosigner. (She had cosigned with my sisters for things like cars) So even though its for me I'm not tied to this loan at all"" She said verbatim: ""I'm going to be in debt until the day i die. You are my only child going to college and i am you mom""
I broke down crying and thanked her. 
Fast forward 1.5 years later I'm home for a break and my mom tells me she is filing for bankruptcy. She got into alot of debt from helping out my oldest sister (23 at the time) with her medical bills (rehab), rent, and lawyers. (My sister got into all of legal trouble) I immediately asked my mom about her eligibility for the loan. She tells me. ""Don't worry i have a bankruptcy lawyer he told me that it wont effect it at all"" 
I did some research and it turns out her bankruptcy will disqualify her for 7 years! I told her this and she said ""Oh. Well i dont know what to tell you. Its already done"" 
Her bluntness told me that she never asked her ""bankruptcy lawyer"" about the loan and she lied to me.
I couldn't make 20k before the next school year. And at my school you couldn't skip more than 1 semester without being unenrolled. 
I tried everything and just couldn't make it happen alone. So i had to drop out.

I was resentful, but i worked hard and after a year of working and saving, a community college added my major! And i was able to pay for it all on my own. 
I am now set to graduate May 2021 and with me graduating soon the topic about paying off the loan came up. She was talking about ""us"" paying it back. I didnt say anything cause i didn't know what to think. 

Legally i know she cant refinance or put anything regarding the loan in my name. (The Parent Plus loan is very clear on this and my mom signed stating she understood that fact)

Morally i know my mom took out this loan for me to go to school so i feel a little obligated to help pay for it. 

WIBTA if i don't help my mom pay back the loan? I'm fully willing to accept if i am and will help in paying

Edit: this may or may not be relevant, but while this was happening (back when we were applying when i was 18) my dad was in the process of suing her for back child support for all 5 of the kids. She was court ordered to pay, but never did and while i was a kid my dad never went after it. (Idk why cause we struggled alot and my dad worked 4 jobs) but when she agree to help pay for my schooling my dad dropped the case and called the debt even. They had this discussion and i never knew about this until my dad told me recently when i talked to him about helping her pay. He told me not to. That agreement was never documented in court obviously. This was my main reason for my feeling conflicted. But i took it out due to character limitations. And i figured due to that being between him and my mom it wasnt relevant. But it may just make my dad TA too.",0,0,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,self,WIBTA if i (23f) don't help my mom (48f) pay back a student loan she took out for me?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/kvi035/wibta_if_i_23f_dont_help_my_mom_48f_pay_back_a/,all_ads,32.0

One time local beauty queen had it all money, dream job, and she was just living her best life. That is until she decided to speed in the rain in her new mustang and hydroplaned into a tree. In my opinion that is suicide by stupid choices.

Another local one is 2 older teenagers riding a four wheeler together in flood water right next to the river. A person that was with them said the water was over the handle bars sometimes. Next thing you know they are swept away and found their bodies a few days later.

Now most recently this 30 year old woman was driving one of those big side by sides with 4 other people in it with her and according to the police report “was traveling at a high rate of speed” and lost control slamming into a tree. Killed herself and another passenger and injured the other 3.

In my opinion none of these are tragic because all of these were preventable with common sense. But it would read if people started posted “ Bobby died cause he was being stupid” instead of talking about “Bobby’s tragic death”.

People need to make examples of these folks in the hopes of preventing someone else from making stupid decisions.

Now the problem: since forever, my stepmom has 1) told us that we’re going to die because we’re eating fatty foods (I promise, we only eat junk food on the weekends, or on special occasions, the last time i had anything unhealthy was my my sister’s birthday a few weeks ago) and 2) come in while we’re eating with a plate for herself and picks the foods she wants from each of our plates. Whenever me or one of my siblings questioned this she would tell us “you’re being disrespectful” , “shut up, I can eat what I want”, or “it would be a waste of time to buy me one because I don’t want one”. I want to make it clear that she does not buy any of the food for our junk-ups. Either I buy for everyone or one of my siblings do. 
Just yesterday, we decided to get burger. This time, I bought food and one of my siblings said “You know what? Get mom one too because you know she’ll just pick off of our plates anyways.” and my dad grumbled something about her not liking that but I didn’t care. I figured she would come around to us buying her a burger too, perhaps she felt excluded which was definitely not our intention. 
When we got home and set our plates to eat, in came my step mom with her own plate and before she could start picking, I put the wrapped burger on her plate and said “Here you go. That was ones all yours. No need to pick at our plates now.” 
She was infuriated with me and screamed at my dad to do something about me and went on and on about how I was being disrespectful towards her and that I needed to learn to share and that I’m too old to be selfish. I just sat there, unwrapped my burger, and ate. My siblings later told me that maybe we shouldn’t have done that because now my stepmom has been stewing about it for some time now. AITA?

Eyewitnesses don't realize just how flimsy their testimonies are, and when someone confidently says ""I saw that guy!"" in court, it goes a long way with juries.

People believe in this idea of flashbulb memory, which states that when something dramatic is happening around you, you take a vivid mental snapshot that you hang onto forever. THIS ISN'T A THING. When we're excited or in high-stress situations, your brain's energy isn't focused on forming and storing memories! It's focused on escaping or calculating or panicking. This goes for big crimes too! If there's a weapon present, it's even less likely that you'll be able to accurately recall the criminal's face. 

And cops and lawyers KNOW this! There are so many tricks they use to manipulate eyewitnesses into choosing the right guy in the line-up or confirming minor details, and your brain can actually REWRITE your memory of the crime based on the new information. After seeing one guy in a cop car and then again at a line-up and then again at court gives your brain enough confirmation bias to say confidently that this guy did it, even if they look nothing like you described in your original statement.

These tactics are used to put innocent people, usually BIPOC, behind bars and into the prison system. If you want more facts and information on people who served DECADES based on a few people who caught a glimpse of the crime.

None of the old stuff I’ve been replacing is worth anything and had suffered quite a bit of damage over the decades. Most of which was before I owned it. As I take care of things. But every time an old piece moves out (something I’ve had for over a decade mind you) my mom, or grandmother, is always “make sure someone in the family doesn’t want that first.” But everyone in our family has their own, rather nice, furniture. They don’t need my hand me downs. Trust me. I have asked and they say “no thanks” each time. Plus they, not once, asked me if I wanted something nice they got rid of recently. For example, my mom just gave her hutch to a friend. I have wanted a hutch for years. She never asked me if I wanted it but I’m expected to ask family first, before friends, if they want my old furniture? So, I recently got rid of my headboard that was probably over 40 years old and didn’t even bother to tell anyone because I know they’d ask “why didn’t you ask if we wanted that back?” Because you don’t ask me if I want something I actually could have used. And the idea of getting rid of something old is making room for the new. I don’t have the space to just store old furniture until I can get it back to you.  When I’m ready for a fresh look, and I’ve already had to move stuff around in the house, I’m not in the mood to haul the old stuff across town.

He stated that he can't go see SOish during the summer because of her conservative parents so he's staying with her in her single dorm. My family thought this was a bad idea Mom was deeply worried his grades would tank whereas X callously said that the University he attends requires that professors make remote lectures for quarantining students and that he's planned this entire thing out. Nevermind that the dorms at my college BANNED people from having guests last semester. 

Here's the thing I know he's an adult who can make his own decisions. But here's the thing, he says he's going to get tested and self-isolate post visit but all of his immediate family is high risk because of various conditions (myself included.)  

I've had to move back into my parents and go completely remote this semester because people in my college town because they were being stupid with COVID and I wasn't safe.  I don't do well with remote learning because of a learning disability and I'm scared because classes start tomorrow and I feel I've sacrificed a lot because of COVID only for what feels like  X has thrown that all out the window.

We’re still great friends but the relationship just wasn’t working anymore, considering I came to the conclusion that I’m a lesbian.  The break up was mostly mutual (he was a little more hurt than me which is understandable) and we still have an amazing friendship.  No hard feelings on my part.

I have a friend that I think would make a really great partner for him; she’s nice, funny and attractive.  Basically anything you could want in a prospective girlfriend.  He also admitted he thinks she’s attractive and would be open to getting to know her sometime, but feels like he shouldn’t because she’s my friend and it would be awkward.

Personally I don’t see a problem, they’re both great people.  And she has a history of falling for all the wrong guys, so it would be nice for me to know she’s with someone who I’m sure will treat her well and be kind to her.  

Now my question is, assuming that she would even be interested in him at all, is this really that weird?  I’m on the spectrum so I know I can have trouble recognizing these social norms and I’d appreciate some opinions.

The start was rough because he wasn't ready, so we were pretty noncommittal. That was emotional and hard for a while (he lost his dad, i lost my mom in the same year). For the last year and a half we've finally come into a committed and very loving place. We started talking about moving in together in the summer. He brings it up  more than I do. I met his family this christmas. Spent a week with them, joined in on family zooms with remote family. Met childhood friends. It all went super well and I felt like everything was really enjoyable and effortless.

While we were there, he learned his ex had a baby (backstory: ex of 5 yrs &amp; ended 6 yrs ago, she broke up with him bc he wasn't growing w her + his depression. got married a year after they broke up.) . I know he thought this was someone he thought he would marry and start a family with. He found out before I did and I didn't really notice any change in his mood or the way he was with me (good sign!) But I know him well enough to know better. I tried to bring it up the day I found out and he asked to talk about it some other time. I understood and let it go. A little more than a week later, he was feeling down. He said New Years and catching up with some successful friends made him feel down on himself. I took that moment to ask about the ex + baby... since all his friends have also had babies in the last year. I kind of regret it because some things were said that I can't fully forget. Like that despite how close we are, how we also talk about family and the future, he maybe felt closer to her then than he does to me still. He then corrected himself and said it's just different and turned it around on me by asking me the same question. He's smart. I could better understand the way both can be true.

I guess I still feel strange. Worried. At one point he mentioned how well they 'understood' each other, not as a comparison, but I was asking questions to understand how he felt about the baby news. He said he used to feel he had the relationship part of life figured out then and then he could focus on career, but instead they broke up and he stagnated. The only reason our relationship was so challenging is because he was so slow to open up. I definitely felt it was worth it. It's almost like had this stupid topic not come up, everything would be great. When she comes up I feel the remaining distance between us and I wonder if the gap will really close. I definitely thought it had. He said this news stung way less than when he found she got married 3 years ago. I want to believe we're not wasting each other's time. I'm SO happy outside of this issue, but I can't tell if this is a warning sign or not. He was truly on a holding pattern after this relationship, so I have a ton of empathy. I think I'm just kind of scared to be hurt at the end of all this. We didn't fight just had a somber night and went to bed. We've been kind and sweet just both a little withdrawn since.

Here’s what happened.  My nephew (M13) stayed the night over the weekend while his parents went on a little getaway.  He really liked my little ritual with my son (M7) where I read with him for 30 minutes before bed.  

My nephew asked me if I could read a book with him too! I told him I would love that very much and suggested he choose any book he wanted and I would Amazon us both a copy and then read with him over FaceTime every day.  He was so excited!

Ok cool. I order the books up on Amazon and we have them the next day. 

Well we start reading and my son asks if he can join us.  I differ to my nephew, would he prefer it just be the two of us or can Son join in? Nephew says son is welcome to read with us.

We start reading and what we are doing is taking turns reading a paragraph or two aloud.  My nephew is really struggling and stumbling over words, but is really having fun so we excitedly keep going for 3 chapters.  My son even gets kind of sucked into the book and was enjoying his turns too. I was impressed by how well he kept up. 

Here’s the AITA part.  My nephew was struggling.  A lot.  My son, however, was not.   

When we ended the call my nephew’s mom called me and let me know she thought I was a real AH for “letting my kid show off” like that.  Honesty it didn’t even occur to me that I was doing something wrong by letting my kid read.  BUT apparently my nephew feels bad about himself because my son is a stronger reader than he is.  He’s always struggled with reading and I guess this just really made it worse for him.

I have known my nephew since he was about 4, his mom married my husband’s brother.  He’s a sweet boy. I have always suspected an underlying issue, possibly dyslexia.   (But his mother doesn’t agree.) Reading has always been a hurdle for him And I was so excited to encourage him! 

But maybe I was short sighted? I mean I guess letting my son join in was a pretty insensitive thing to do. 

My husband is also pretty upset with me too.  He says that we shouldn’t use our son to make his nephew feel badly about himself. And it was a very “catty and selfish” thing to do.

I genuinely just wanted to spend some time with these kids and was excited to share our little tradition with my nephew.

The reasoning for my actions are :

On New Year’s Day my parents had gotten drunk with my aunt and other grandparents and a fight occurred  between my parents (this isn’t the first time and the police and CPS have been involved at times too). I found out from seeing a post about it on Facebook after my dad posted about it. My little brothers had to stay at my aunts and my older brother isn’t going back home (his words in the comments) 

The day before my uncle had brought round a bottle of vodka for my parents as a New Years gift. I was under the impression my parents didn’t know about it so I told my grandad to get rid of it and explained why and showed him the post. He agreed with me and got rid of it as he knew if he gave them it, trouble would happen again. 

Well I’ve not thought anything of it for the past few days but I’m assuming my parents have had a drink again as I got a text from my mam saying I’m an asshole for “wasting my uncle’s money” and “sticking my nose in what isn’t my business”. In my opinion, I did what was right as if I’d not have said, it could’ve endangered my two little brothers to a degree (my parents wouldn’t intentionally hurt them but they could still be effected in other ways) and it would also be feeding their addiction. 

I’ve refused to talk to my mam early New Year’s Day as she was already drunk and was being an arsehole trying to guilt trip me into running errands for her in heavy rain on a broken bike. I refused to talk to either of them after I found out what happened later on in the day.

However when we have a relatively big one, my wife handles it in a very strange and uncomfortable way. 

I'll spare the details, but my wife recently did something that made me pretty mad. I sat on it for a day to process it, and eventually brought it up and told her how I felt. She was defensive at first, but I didn't back down and let her know that she messed up and needs to make things better. 

I don't understand the psychology behind it, but she's reacted like this before a few times as well when I get really upset. She basically resorts to being completely overly sexual and will not divert from it. I'll say something like ""What you did really upset me, here's why, blah blah blah"" and then in response all she'll say is ""I want to suck your dick so bad"" and then I'll continue to go on about why I'm upset and she'll continue being overly sexual, sometimes for hours on end. 

It's almost as if she completely blocks out what I'm saying and just responds with a sexual comment to whatever I have to say. Like she's not there at all and is just shutting down and going on autopilot.

Then comes the real question. We look at distant stars and planets using telescopes. I know that the current telescopes are not about enlarging pictures but gathering photons. But suppose we had at our disposal a telescope with infinite enlargement functionality. Would we be able to choose a planet, distant as hell and enlarge it to the point we could see its surface details or is detail lost forever as the light travels?

If it is lost, how it is lost?

I broke up with my ex girlfriend a month ago yesterday. I’ve wanted to get in touch with her sooner, mainly to check she’s okay, but I was strongly advised by everyone I spoke to not to do so. The breakup was completely clean which was kinda shocking, as she was pretty controlling and basically co-dependent, so people advised me not to give her any hint the relationship could be recovered. Plus she was still getting in Instagram photos and going to social stuff, so I knew she was at least okay to a certain degree.

Anyway, as a result of this we still have each other’s stuff. Mainly she’s got a few of my favourite t shirts, including one that I got studying abroad in NZ and therefore cannot really replace. On the other end, I’ve got a few of her clothes which are obviously no use to me- but I also owe her a decent amount of money (£120/$140) which I don’t want to look like I’ve done a runner from. 

It would be good to see her and get all this stuff swapped/sorted. If I’m being honest, I’d also like to keep her as a friend, but I initiated the break up so that isn’t really my call.

The issue is, the New Year is super important to her symbolically- fresh start all that type of jazz. That’s partially why I broke up with her when I did, so she could work through some of it before the NY and take it as a new start.

Does that mean if I pop my head back up now, in the NY,  is that kinda toxic for her and ruining her fresh start?? Should I just take the loss and let it go? Or do I go for a middle ground and send her the money without saying anything (she has since logged into my Amazon prime- which I’m totally fine with I’m paying anyway- and we didn’t speak so that option might be acceptable).

So since she's a Kpop fan too, and I recently just learned a new one, along with the choreography, I decided to perform that instead. It is called ""Can't Stop Me"" by TWICE. It is a high and loud song with very hard choreography.

So the performance happened. I gave it my all. I sang energetically and showcased my explosive dance moves. Her groom, however, didn't like ir. Actually, most of the visitors, who are mostly the groom's relative, didn't. His mom even scolded me in private, saying I ruined the solemnity of the event.

My best friend apologized because she didn't expect that her in laws and husband would hate it. But I think it is her right to ask for the song she wants because she's the bride, but then, the groom is also a part of this, and he also deserved what he wanted.

My bf (26) and I have been together for 6 years and recently moved it together. 

Communication has been a constant issue throughout our relationship and I'm getting really tired of being a nag or a follower (meaning he sets a rule and I'll follow along)

Since moving together, I never know what time he'll be home. Sometimes he might get overtime and stay later but never tells me for how long. 

Usually when he gets home, I start dinner, we eat and he sleeps early since he wakes up at 3am for work. 

The thing is, I'm annoyed that we spoke about communicating while he's at work to make sure he knows I'm OK being home alone. I agreed to do so since it made him feel better but he doesn't do the same. He's practically a ghost to me and shows up home whenever.

Yesterday, he spoke to his mom and I heard him mention to her that he'd stop by tomorrow (today now). I didn't say anything (I was in the living room) and just did what my therapist recommends ""just watch and wait.""

Today, he had gotten out of work early (which he rarely does unless work is slow) and called me while he was headed to his moms. 

I was annoyed that I'm always waiting and wondering what time he'll be home since I feel like I tend to him immediately once he does. I've been feeling like a maid almost...like last time. We were in bed already and he was heading to the kitchen for something. As he got up, I remembered about his lunch and said ""oh, I forgot to pack your lunch!"" 

He just walked towards the kitchen and said ""okay, thanks for packing!"" 

That's when I stopped and thought ""wait, why can't he pack it since he's in the kitchen? I pack it every night, cook every night, ask him what he wants every night, cut up his meat sometimes!...wtf?"" 

Anyway, he called and said he was going to his mom's which he didn't mention last night. He asked if it was okay and I just responded ""thanks for letting me know."" I wasn't sarcastic or being rude, just in a monotone voice.

Again, communication has always been an issue in our relationship and I'm just growing so tired of it...so tired to the point where I'm just thinking about ending things even if he's a great guy and I feel stupid for thinking about ending it over communication...

It sounds stupid to react and think over this event but its been an accumulation of different reasons over the years. I feel like a mother telling her son over and over on the importance of communication. 

Just a few weeks ago, we were talking about our savings and he said that has only $300 or so left..

I didn't fucking know this! I have over $6,000, this is money that I'm now using for BOTH of us in case of emergencies. I asked him where it went and he said ""all our stuff we bought when we were moving out.""

I used some savings, I honestly admit but I didn't blow the whole thing! 

I really just want to take time apart from him now...

Again, it sounds stupid for me to feel this way just because he's heading to his mom's but I just couldn't help but feel the compounding effect of it.

I'm making dinner right now and I don't want to wait up anymore.

By way of background, My town's chamber of commerce sponsors a straight grant program for young entrepreneurs that pays out a sum of a few thousand dollars to go toward a young person's business. Back when my brother ""Kevin"" was in high school, he applied for the grant for his business but lost to ""Donovan"" who was a peer in his schools business program.

Fast forward to today, Donovan's business is thriving with multiple locations in our area, employing dozens of people. He used the grant money to further his business, put himself through school while running it, and expanded it over the years. Kevin bounced around schools, eventually getting a degree in business, and works a regular job that he claims to enjoy, but he has always harbored resentment and jealousy toward Donovan because of his success and the grant. 

A few months ago, one of Donovan's locations was broken into. When i initially heard about this i assumed it was a theft but thought nothing more of it. I recently caught up with a friend who worked at that location and what he told me shook me to my core. 

The person who broke in did not take anything of value... equipment, a cash box, everything was accounted for. The person who broke in smeared feces all over the place. And i mean ALL over the place. They had to shut down that location while a hazardous material cleaning crew disinfected the place. There were poops smeared on the wall, a giant turd left on a keyboard, someone shit into a coffee filter and made a pot of poop coffee, there was diarrhea over literally every surface in one of the bathrooms except for the toilet, there was even a frozen poop in the kitchen freezer.

I listened in horror as this friend described the feces. Reddit, i am sure that Kevin is responsible for this. He and i are estranged and shit, but many years ago i recall him drunkenly telling me about his plan to get revenge on donovan for winning the grant money by covering him in poop. I figured it was a joke, as he changed the subject, but i cant help but shake this feeling. Even though we are estranged, i would hate to falsely accuse him (or anyone) of this.

I was totally taken back as this was never something that was brought up before. I had no idea he was into that, he comes off as a very macho guy, played college football and we share a friend group, he’s the manly man of the group. 
I went along with it because I wanted to get as much info as I could, since this was my first time hearing about this (I am straight) he even asked me to personally find one for him and set it up for him. Again, I was acting like I was okay with it because I was in pure shock and couldn’t believe it was happening, while wanting to get as much info out of him as possible. 
I am so taken back as this should have been a sit down conversation, not something he springs on me DURING sex and just expects me to be okay with.
I respect his sexual preference, it’s just unfair that this is only coming to light now and in the manner that it did.

The next morning he didn’t really remember much and said he blacked out. So I left it alone.

He knows how I feel about cheating, and he also always makes comments about hating cheaters, and has even made me promise that if I ever want to end the relationship, I would do it before cheating. I feel that what he is asking me to do is cheating. He also is very jealous and hates when other men try to talk to me, so I feel like part of him does care for me, but now I feel like I am being used as a cover up. He obviously doesn’t want him friends or family to know about this fetish so I feel like the purpose of him dating me is to hide that side of him. I don’t know what to do.
My heart feels broken. Was he ever even attracted to me? After that night going into the next day when he didn’t remember anything, he expressed that he would like to move in together. I went along with it. 

He always made it seem like he was so into me, and only me, he even told me that he didn’t watch porn anymore because he was all about me ( which I didn’t care even if he did watch porn) but then when he was drunk that night and expressing his fetish, I asked him to show me the porn he watches, and it was transgender women fucking guys, and they were all tatted and blonde, total opposite of me.

I feel so used, and like everything was a lie. My heart feels shattered. What do I do? How do I address this? If he denies it and says he was just super drunk, what am I expected to do? 

Ps. I am acting like it didn’t happen since he doesn’t remember, so I am just acting normal.

One door is where the orders are taken, the other serves as the pickup/outstation. 
Since it's cold, guests usually place an order and go elsewhere. So, a phone number is placed with an order, so the machine can text (that number connected to the order) once the kitchen checks it off as completed. Now, on to where I messed up.  

G is Guest
Me is My response  
[Paraphrasing will be used in the following sequence of events]. 

After placing the guest's order and number in, I went back to give his change &amp; receipt. He tipped me, I thanked him. While looking over his receipt, he goes:  

G: Are you going to text me? Or... 
Me: No, I can't! There is this thing about guests and workers, y'know... 
G: [something] my order?  
Me: Yes. For that. 

His head tilted once that was said, so I just nodded to avoid regretting more words. He didn't move or say anything after that, which caused me to take that as leave to go. 

I was walking pretty directly away from the door to let a manager know. I'm the type of worker that lets management be aware of stuff that has to do with me before someone or something else lets my actions be known, I hope that makes sense. 

The manager that was there found it more humorous than concerning thankfully! Then gave a couple of examples of how I could apologize if I was the one to give this guest their order.  
I ended up bagging his order, so I threw a couple of extra sauces in there for good measure. And when it came time to give it to him, it pretty much went with: 
 
Me: I'm sorry for what I said earlier, I didn't understand exactly what you meant.  
G: It's fine. Have a good night.
Me: Have a good night!  

Yep, that's the end of it. I told the manager that gave me advice on the matter, y'know. I didn't register what he meant partly because most guest uses the same phrase for that type of question. It's the first time, I've ever gotten a ""will you call"", it's usually"" when is the text"" or ""is it a text or call"" those type of things. I took him saying ""you"" as him addressing me instead of the business/company text he was expecting.

I really don't know what to do in this kind of situation... So my mom and my dad used to live separately when I (21f) was 9 months old-7 years old (my mom told me it's because my dad's family kicked her out). They got back together just so that I can live like other kids that have a 'parents'. 

My mom is an amazing business woman, everything she sells always success and she's really good in managing money, while my dad he's not so good in making his own business and well don't know how to manage money (but he's a great worker, just not good in business). After a few years of living together again, both of my parents realized that most of the income comes from my mom so they decided that my dad will stop working and will be taking care of me (taking me to school, etc). Everything went well for awhile i guess, until when I was 15 my mom started to get tired of being the only economic supporter in this family and started belittling my dad and pressuring him to earn money in a passive aggressive way. like I would ask for a money to pay my school fee and she'd say ""ask your dad, don't always ask money to me"".

Now a little back story for my mom, i know why she hated him. first of all being kicked out by in laws after just having a baby is not a really nice memory. also when my dad was working and my mom became a stay at home wife (before having me) my dad would never trust my mom for his income like he manages his own money, and it still pisses my mom till now. and I think since now my mom is the only source of income she started taking a revenge?

My dad used to be a typical man with pride where he thinks he's the alpha and he's the best, but since he stop working he started to realized he's wrong and changing i guess. He already apologize to my mom and said he'll be a better husband. 

My mom still hold grudges to my dad, and they went to therapy for that, but I don't think it helps them a lot... my mom would be angry for no reason and my dad will be the one apologizing over and over.

every time my dad disagree about something with my mom, like ""I think this brand of water tastes better"" she'd get pissed of for a few days or... months. and when she's pissed she'll terrorize me with ""your dad don't work, do you know why I hate your dad?, he's a weak man, an asshole, his family sucks, etc""

It happens again, this time longer, since August 2020, and she lives in the other city and i stay with my dad (we have 2 businesses in each city and my dad helps managing one of them). They still needs to communicate about bills and stuff so as my mom wouldn't answer my dad's text, I'm the one to tell mom on behalf of my dad that there's bill to pay. And I'll be the one who have to translate the petty reply to my dad so there will be less arguments. her petty reply will be ""ask your dad to work and earn money a

it's stressing me out really. I have nothing to do with their problem but why am I being the one in the middle and have to be a messenger to them. I know my dad is a good man, he's just not a great business man, he never cheats and he takes care of me very well when I was a kid till now. The more I. tell her. There are no major reason why my mom should be angry about my dad besides of what he did in the past in which he apologized for and tried to do better, like did nothing wrong nowadays.

I (21F) am I single mum and have a beautiful daughter (19mths) and a son on the way. I live in a different state to my family but when I last visited I blew up at my sister (29F) for what she said about my daughter when she was just 3mths old and my mum told me I'm a asshole for still holding onto it yet my sister still stands by what she said. So when my daughter was 3mths old I went up to visit my family most haven't seen her yet at that point and my sister within seconds of meeting her said oh look she's so active maybe she'll be like her cousin who has ADHD. This ticked me off like hell not because I would have a problem if she was I have a disability myself and hate being labelled with it which she knows but because she said it within minutes of meeting her for the first time. I still hold a grudge against her for saying it and the last time I went up there to visit I blew up at her after days of her making side ass remarks about my parenting and my daughter ( I would try to put her to bed and she would make as much noise possible and laugh hearing her cry and me struggling) while she would yell at her children (8M and 10M) because in her words you can't ask them to do something they won't do it you have to yell and tell them too. Well I had post partum depression after I had my daughter and have been thinking of moving back up once my daughter is 2 and told my mum she shouldn't of told my sister because everyone would now know and nothing is set in stone as I require my childrens father's permission to move states. I also told her I don't want her anywhere near my children until she apologized for what she said about my daughter and even then I wouldn't want her to have frequent contact with them. Well my mum says I'm being petty for holding onto this and should let it go because she's family while my friends don't think I am and shouldn't even move back since my mum won't accept what my sister says and does is wrong and with my mum telling me off when I defend myself or my daughter against my sister yet my mum never tells her off for doing it and says I'm a adult and can handle my own battle yet can't defend myself against her and she won't defend me either because I'm a adult now.

Edit: The thing my 3 month old daughter did that made my sister to say she was hyperactive was not look at my sister when we just walked into her house and sat on the floor and instead looked at the new environment she was in.

This went on for months until maybe about a month ago I snapped because I was stressed that day and had other more important things to do.So I told him that it gets annoying for him to constantly keep messaging nagging me about the homework and he needs to stop and only ask me when he really needs help, he waits a bit and just says sorry and ok.

I was honestly really pissed and messaged another friend that I knew from when we were little and he said that my other friend was just not expecting it and that's why he didn't respond that much. I then get a text from my classmate saying that he relies on me because he says he gets bad grades and he really needs my help. I personally think this is bull because we are both in honors.

Four days ago she texted me saying that she missed talking with me and that she wants to know what's up with my life (On the messages she was saying that she sees me with lots of love), but I insisted that I need time.
It is important to add that she also said some things about being sure of her decision but, at the same time, she said that she misses me.

She's been uploading instagram stories with sad songs about me not being there, and also, I can see in Spotify that she's been listening to sad songs about being without me and about wanting to be with me.

Note: She said that she loves me and that she feels a lot of desire  for my body when she broke up with me.

When she asked for time to think about the relationship, she had the idea that I would be always by her side even if she broke up with me. 

Is she regretting her decision? If she still loves me, still wants my body and feels that sad when I'm not around, makes me think that she's regretting what she's done.

About 6-7 months ago i met a girl that i really liked. I knew what she looked like, but it was more her personality that pulled me in. We went on a few dates and everything was fine. We were talking almost every day, but then out of nowhere she started to build up a distance. After i reacted like a dick and didn‘t really give her a lot of space she blocked me. I was hurt but got the needed ass-kicking to get my life together. I focussed on myself and dropped around 25kg (i was really fat, it was getting disgusting). I‘m now working towards a psychology degree and overall i am really getting my life together. BUT i can‘t get her out of my head because every girl i talked to in the last 6 months, that i was slightly interested in, didn‘t give me the same vibe that i had with her. I reached out today and wrote her on a secondary account to thank her, because she really helped me, even though she kinda broke my heart a bit. The big picture is what matters and a lil heartbreak in trade for a healthier lifestyle and a plan for my career seems like a fair deal. 

Now to my question: Everything seems fine, she‘s not changed and doesn‘t hold a grudge or anything. But i don‘t know if i should try something again if possible. I mean i have a lot more to offer than before.

Background
I've never gotten along with my mum. I think she's a nasty person who should never have had children, shes also a Karen. She would contantly scream at me until I was in tears as a child then pretend it never happened a little while later. My dad worked away a lot when I was younger so he never really seen anything going on. 

I was a straight A student all through high school, I didn't smoke, drink or do drugs. I got a job straight out of school to work while at college/university but its never good enough for her even though I was the first in my family to go to college. She's destroyed my mental health. I've been dealing with pretty bad depression and anxiety since I was around 13 as well as full body pains. My mum says I cant have either cause im too young.

I have two older siblings who moved out the first chance they could (they're 15/16 years older and moved in with partners). I'm still living at home because I can't afford to move out alone (I'm not paying rent because my dad refuses to let me but I pay for my phone and buy most of my own food and other stuff).

Anyway, my mum called me through the livingroom last night and told me she has to go get lots of tests done and the doctors think it might be cancer. I didnt know what to say. Cancer sucks and I  wouldnt wish it on anyone but when she told me I didn't feel anything. It felt like when you find out a stranger has it. Apparently she wasn't even going to tell me about it but my dad forced her too.

So my boyfriend went on a trip last week and let me stay in his apartment while he was away. Being the curious female I am, I went on his computer and looked at some of the stuff he has on there because he doesn’t have a password. I went to his photo album and was able to see all of his photos because they are synced with his phone. 

I saw numerous pictures w other girls, ex’s, etc, whatever. But what I found strange was that some of the photos he would text me as he was going about his day, they were actually taken years ago, but he sent me them as if they were taken in real time right then and there. 

For example on this last thanksgiving, he randomly sent a photo later that day of his parents with the caption “my parents say happy thanksgiving.” When I saw that same photo on his computer, the photo was from May of 2016. 

Whenever he has dinner at his parents’ house sometimes he’ll send me of photo of the family cat. I looked through and saw that two of the photos he’s sent me before were from November 2019. Mind you, I’ve only been seeing and talking to him since the end of October 2020. 

Another example. We met on bumble, and I remember him sending me a photo of himself (the very first day we matched and started talking) in a golf cart w his friend saying that it was from golf that day. We matched towards the end of October last year. When I saw that same photo in his camera roll, the photo was from May of 2019. 

I’m sure you get the gist. Well I’ve found out a way to confront him about it without revealing that I went through his laptop and found this out. Is it crazy for me to assume that he was probably lying about being at his parents’ house for dinner and was actually somewhere else doing god knows what during covid times? I trust that he wouldn’t cheat on me, but I don’t understand the purpose or need to send me these photos especially when I never asked to see a photo of his parents or cat and he just sent them voluntarily. Me having past difficult trust issues doesn’t help the situation either, and I was just starting to get over that hurdle.

I moved out when I was 18. At the time my mom's husband had his three daughters full time. But last year his oldest (14f) started having issues due to trauma from some stuff that happened years before and they were advised to give her space with some other family. She moved in with her grandparents but it didn't help. Then when she was asked where she would ideally like to live she said with me. She said she didn't really get to spend any time with me but I was the older sister she always wanted. So my mom called and explained what had happened  she had said and the reasons she gave for wanting to live with me and how all the professionals involved believed she needed to be comfortable and in a safe space where she felt capable of working through her trauma. And she asked me would I let her come live with me. She said before that she knew I would say no but she wanted to be the one to ask because she worried her husband would be too forceful. I told her she always knew me well and confirmed I was not okay with that.

Her husband went nuclear on me. He accused me of being selfish and abandoning my sister in her hour of need. He told me you help family when they need you even if you don't think you can. You do everything physically possible to help them. Then he started saying I was being unfair to my mom and after maybe twenty minutes of him ranting on the phone to me he asked me what was the issue and I told him, I'm 22 and I'm not sure I'm equipped to help a teenager who has the struggles his daughter has. He said my choice of wording ""your daughter"" was not very kind. He said at least call her my sister. I said I didn't have that kind of relationship with his girls. Then he said that's what it was all about.

I told him I know he needs to help his daughter but he does need to find someone else because I am not in the position to do it.

We almost had a repeat experience (after I told my mom and she told him to stop) and the second I answered the phone he started cussing at me so I hung up.

Now I'm kinda wondering if I am in the wrong here. Because I know he's just trying to help his daughter and apparently she attached to me way more than I attached to her in the three to four months we lived together. And the few times I was around them since.

He was the first person I ever had sex with, but cheated on me and manipulated me for the entire relationship. Almost three years later I’m doing much better, and I’m in a much happier and healthier relationship with a different guy now. My ex and I haven’t had any contact since we broke up. 

Except every now and then, I go through periods of having intense vivid dreams about my ex. Last time this happened was last summer, but I was going through a break up at that point so I just pinned it down to that. At that time though the dreams were all about him wanting me back and telling me how much he missed me. 

Last night was the first time since then that I had a dream about him, but instead of the usual fairly innocent ones, this was a full blown sex dream. It’s really shaken me up and I can’t stop thinking about it now, which is driving me even more insane because I know the more I think about it, the more dreams will happen. 

There’s nothing missing from my current relationship, if anything it’s a huge upgrade. My new boyfriend is committed, the sex is great and I can tell that I have true feelings for him rather than the infatuation I had with my ex. Except, I still can’t shake him off in my dreams. 

Is there any way to stop these dreams? They’re driving me insane. I’ve spent a lot of time in counselling the past few months working on letting go of him and I thought I was really making progress, but these dreams always just put me straight back to square one again

So I (20f) have been living with my roommate (20f) since August. We knew each other in high school, had a lot of mutual friends, and bonded over liking a clean, quiet home. This is extremely important to me, as I can be quite high-strung, so I thought we’d make great living partners. 

At first, things seemed fine. She brought her cat, which was okay with me (especially because her old roommate didn’t take care of it and we wanted him to have a good home), but now she’s the one not taking care of him. She loves him a lot, but she doesn’t clean up his poop in the litter box for days at a time. I bought her a litter genie to alleviate this problem (and the smell), but she still leaves his litter box full. He kicks litter around the apartment and it’s all over the kitchen floor and in little piles around his box, and she just lets it collect. He also killed all my plants and she didn’t do anything about it.  

She’s not a good cleaner. She does clean every couple of weeks, but on the everyday, things are gross. The stovetop after she cooks, the countertops, and especially her dishes. We have a drying rack for essentials so we don’t have to run the dishwasher, but her “clean” dishes end up dirtying my actual clean dishes. I rewash everything in the rack — there’s caked on food, oil, etc. Every surface you run your hand over leaves you with residue or hitting a dried over dirty patch, especially handles for some reason. I never even knew that was possible. The garbage piles up until I take it out, and there’s a smell of something just ~gross~ in the kitchen no matter how much I clean it. 

She has her boyfriend over a lot, which I also told her I was okay with. However, the 3-4 times a week he is over they make a mess in the kitchen, watch TV with the volume all the way up, and then go have extremely loud sex. Even with her door shut and TV on AND my door shut with my TV on, on opposite sides of the apartment, I can still hear them like they were in my room. I’ve confronted her about this multiple times, and each instance she says, “Well, at least you know I’m having a good time!”

I don’t feel at home here. She took over all the common areas with her furniture and knick knacks. The living room TV has her XBOX connected. I hole up in my room just to avoid everything. 

So here’s where I might be TA. I haven’t told her yet how close I am to moving out. To leave, I’d have to break my part of the lease, leaving her to pay the full rent. I wouldn’t leave until I knew we had a plan in action and I spoke to my landlord. Most rental agreements in our city don’t allow for sublets, including ours, which adds another layer to this situation. We talked a few months ago about having her boyfriend move in, but this is very last-minute if it happened now. I don’t want to be a jerk and leave her with nothing.

Since before my wife and I wed, my MIL has made everything about herself. 

When wedding planning she tried forcing my wife into buying a wedding dress exactly like the one she wore (but was on sale woohoo). 

She cried about not being included in the wedding planning, but then proceeded to show absolutely no interest when we reached out to her. 

Two weeks before the wedding she claimed she wasnt going to even come to our wedding. Making EVERYONE ELSE who attended change to suit her. 

From the beginning of our relationship all the conversations with her parents consist of asking some form of ""when are you gonna come visit?"" ""Why don't you come visit?"" And ""we would love to see you"". With the exception of our wedding, they have been up to see US a grand total of two times (we have visited them several times). These phone calls tend to end with my wife in tears and me wanting to verbally rip my in-laws a new anus. 

Now we are buying a house! Our first house! A JOYOUS occasion, since we have had to weed through several bad homes before finding a good one. And, granted, they did say they were happy for us. But in the same breath they instantly say ""but you will be so far away from us"" and they constantly complain about my family being nearby.

We didn't choose my family over hers. Although for emotional health and stability, the choice is obvious. 

I want to tell her parents basically this ""hey, we want you in our lives. We want you in our future kids lives. But we are choosing where we want to live because it's where WE WANT. We are not choosing my parents over you guys. We like this town. We like our jobs, we like the schools. We always make it clear as can be that you are welcome to visit and stay with us, but you never take us up on it, so please stop laying the guilt on us."" 

Of course that is the diplomatic version I want to lay on them. Free of expletives. Lol

While we have been in relationships in the past, this is our first serious relationship and we sometimes have issues that we don't know how to deal with because we're both inexperienced with relationships.

Our first issue is communication; When an issue arises I like to sit down and discuss things in detail to come to a conclusion. On the other hand my boyfriend likes to pause the conversation to spend time thinking about it (this is usually a day or so, which leaves me feeling extremely anxious). As well as this, when I'm trying to sit down and talk to him about something he's done that I dislike, he always thinks that I'm criticizing him (which I'm really not trying to do). So the first part is - how do we improve our communication?

Our second issue is sex; As we have been together for a long time, we got too comfortable in our relationship and stopped making effort with sex (something we have both noticed and agreed with), so eventually it became almost a routine. We haven't had sex in a couple of weeks and thought we would try again over this weekend. Every time we have tried he has wanted to start off with some extremely difficult sex position (to try and add the spice back quickly) which ended up either me hurting him as I wasn't turned on enough, or being unable to do the position.

Thank you first off for taking the time to read this as there’s other things you could spend your time doing but you spent it trying to help me.

My girlfriend and I broke up a little more than a year ago due to issues we were having and my having trust issues because of some things that were happening. We met in May of 2020 and spoke to each other in great detail about how we felt and we both loved each other very much still. She ended the conversation with “I will always love you, ______ _____”.  It felt like a movie. I’ve always missed her and I genuinely began to want to pursue things again because I do have the capability to trust her change and I just really love the woman.

Before &amp; during our relationship, we’d communicate our emotions by adding to a collaborative playlist on Spotify. It was one of our -things- to get music together. The first date we ever had was spent making a playlist in this adventure journal we’d gotten together. I still read it every now and then. When we broke up, I kept checking her Spotify and have almost every day since the break up. When we met in May, she confessed to doing the same. I’ve gone ahead and made a playlist letting her know I’d like to get in touch again because back in May I told her I didn’t want to hurt her anymore, so I wanted her to get in touch with me first when she was ready.

Now, though, my brother has died. He did something very dumb and I’m angry. I’m very lost. She was the only person I confided in back then and she had some similar problems with her family that made things really comfortable to talk about. I almost feel a need, now, to see her and hold her and be with her. I miss her comfort. I don’t want to hurt her but I want everything with her again. Since our breakup, everything bad has given me a new perspective that makes me thankful for the relationship we had. It wasn’t bad. I just didn’t trust her enough to give her a shot. I can trust her now- I can feel it.

I made the playlist yesterday with a small description as a way to let her know I want to talk to her. I figured this would be a good way to let her know without directly confronting her if she’s not feeling the best about being in touch.

At first our relationship was great and our bond with each other is quite strong. She comes from a very conservative christian middle-eastern family and i come from a very liberal Italian family. I live on my own and she lives with her parents.  


Over the course of our relationship, I wanted to take our relationship to the next level (prior to COVID-19) by traveling, taking weekend trips etc...but she is limited by her family. She cant stay at my place past 11pm (including weekends), cant travel with me or even do a simple weekend trip unless shes married.   


These things are my biggest passions and this roadblock has lead to a few arguments between her and I. She says that even though this is something she wants to do these things with me, she has to respect her parents wishes, to which my response is ""Well, youre an adult, you can do whatever you like"".  


So of course, slowly over time, I became slowly unhappy with our relationship because it was the same thing every time were together. So...I did a piece of shit thing and I started talking to someone else (I never met them or had a real date, just text). Anyways my GF caught me, which sent me feeling guilty and I decided to try even harder for our relationship and I would do my best to make it up to her.  


Fast forward to now (months later), I made efforts to build a closer relationship with her parents, sisters, inquired about a engagment ring etc...   


But now, she monitors my social media, she checks who I follow, what I post and it just leads to argument and I am legit not doing anything wrong, I do photographer on the side and if a woman comments on it (Non flirting), it leads to a huge argument on how I know her etc...I feel like every move I make is being tracked and its leading me to be unattracted to her.  


I don't know if i should just end it because I want to happy and I don't want to live in scrutiny for the rest of my life.  I do love her but i do not love this side of her....even though its my fault, ive went grea lengths to ease her anxiety but I dont know if i can out up with this anymore.",0,0,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,self,Me (32M and my GF (27F) are running into issues,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/kw126t/me_32m_and_my_gf_27f_are_running_into_issues/,all_ads,6.5

I was able to find someone from his old group of friends from when he was in his 20s who has been helping me contact some of the others. He told me that unfortunately one of their close friends had recently died due to covid last year. My dad hasn’t been in contact with them for 30+ years. 
My problem is, if I told him about his friend that died, he would ask how I knew and I would have to explain what I had been doing and the surprise would be over. Obviously the idea of the surprise feels ridiculous now that this has happened, as it’s way more serious and important than anticipated. Trouble is, I have quite a lot of friends and family in on the surprise, and it would be a shame as he has gone through so much in recent years I really wanted to do something nice for him and make him feel special. 
I‘ve considered possibly waiting until after his birthday to tell him, but it feels wrong to not tell him. WIBTA if I waited? Is there another way to go about this?

Edit - thank you so much for all your replies and advice. They were very close, he is actually my brothers godfather and I believe he was the best man at my parents wedding too. They only lost touch because we moved away when I was a baby, one of them changed phone numbers and social media obviously wasn’t a thing in the early 90s so he hasn’t been able to track any of them down.

I've been with this girl in a long-distance relationship for about a year now and for about first maybe 3 months into our relationship she had continued to use a dating site Badoo, however she said she only used it to find friends. About 5 months into the relationship I asked her if she could delete it because it made me quite uncomfortable and anxious at times as I'm a HEAVY overthinker. She said it's not a problem since apparently she didn't use it anymore and said she also wouldn't want me to be on a dating site where I could see all the girls liking my profile and so on. The problem is that about 2 months ago she secretly made a new account again (I only found out because of a screenshot which she sent me that had notifications from Badoo). I didn't say anything because I only noticed it like a week later after she had sent the ss and also I didn't think it would really solve anything because it seems like she didn't really care about what I feel about it when she made it again so why would she now. I really wouldn't mind if it was on a dating site that has 'friends section' but afaik this one doesn't and she said that Badoo (and every other dating site in my country) is mostly just horny and desperate dudes. One last thing I don't really understand is her saying that she hates texting so much (in general, not just with me), which is why we now text a lot less than before, but she made a dating site account so she could talk to other people. I'm starting to feel extremely anxious about it again. Should I confront her about it or should I continue ignore it?

I (f27) work at a salon with nothing but females. We mostly work well enough together, however there is always a bad apple or two that tend to spoil the bunch. It seems like no matter how much I try to keep to myself , go to my job and stay private , the “bad apples” are always trying to wait for the next “tea” session to spill. It’s not just me, but everyone seems to be a potential target for these bad apples, regardless of how pointless it is. 
I recently got engaged on Christmas Eve after being with my SO for 9 years. Naturally , I was excited and made a Facebook post about it. Now I know it’s cliche to be engaged around the holidays, I even admit that. I had literally no idea he would propose on Christmas Eve. I was completely blind sided by it,  but I really don’t  care how common it was to get engaged around the holidays, I was elated, and wanted to make a simple post about it. 
So, the same day I posted about my engagement , the bad apple shared a post (the one where it looks like a relationship status change) and the post said “did not get engaged.” Even a couple of my coworkers  entertained this in the comments with laughing gifs. 
I have a feeling this is directed towards me, even though I do not associate with this person, or am I friends with her. It makes no sense. I don’t do anything to anybody, yet out of nowhere I’m the butt of someone’s joke because I had an awesome thing happen to me. I usually brush off stupid petty things like this, but it just makes me so angry because there are so many other coworkers who fly under the radar and somehow managed to swerve these kinds of passive aggressive remarks. Even though they aren’t close to the bad apples either. 
Is there anyway I can handle this ? The only conclusion I’ve come up with is just to ignore it and carry on, but this seems to be a reoccurring theme of jabs at me over any little thing (along with other coworkers that deal with the same thing I do) 
how do I keep my cool and professionalism ? I’m afraid if I confront someone about it , it’ll fall back to the whole “I wasn’t talking about you” response and then I end up looking like the ass.

He had a fit and said I should forget the house because he doesn't want rules for when he visits. He said I'm just being paranoid and no one will notice.

I'm still seeing the house, because it's been really difficult finding one in a quiet neighborhood (I'm a teacher). If I end up liking the house and buying it, I'll just pay the HOAs and he can still visit if he likes but no car. But I think I MBTA here because maybe I'm just being paranoid.

My mother is a bit overwhelming, narcissistic, and stresses me out, and my dad enables her behavior. They both also work in the medical field, this is important to know.

I have never wanted a big wedding, and with Covid and the pregnancy we have the perfect reasons to just do a courthouse ceremony then have a party for everyone (parents included) once the pandemic is settled and baby has arrived. 

My mother is insisting she and my father fly down for the ceremony. I don’t want her to come. Again, we aren’t close. But there’s also the issue of my (our) safety. I can’t get the vaccine according to my OBGYN (at least, not yet - it’s not available to me), she’d have to fly down then quarantine in a hotel for 14 days which she cannot afford so the cost would fall to me and she can’t take that much time off work, so she’d be putting her job at risk as well. We’re trying to save money to buy a house before baby arrives.

For what it’s worth, she wasn’t at my brothers wedding either. He had an intimate ceremony in the woods with just him and his wife, no attendees or family. His reasons were similar to mine for not inviting them. They weren’t told of the wedding until after it happened so now both my parents are putting pressure on us to have them at ours. Again, it’s a courthouse ceremony. It’s not even a wedding and we will have a party next year that everyone can attend to celebrate.

Probably properly stupid but my logic is as follows:

We dig up lots of fossil fuels. These when burned release lots of CO2 in the air. CO2 bad. However, people say that plants can absorb this CO2 and save the day. That’s how the CO2 ended up in the ground anyways. 

So here’s the kicker, the plants that stored the CO2 we are now releasing, did something modern plants can’t do. The mechanisms that allowed oil and coal to form aren’t possible anymore as far as I understand. Because organic matter now decomposes. It is my understanding that the initial load of CO2 was able to get trapped because the plants got covered up and pressurized before they could decompose (over many many years)

So my point being, if we plant a shitload of trees, these will then capture some CO2 yes, but then after a hundred years or so the trees die and release the CO2 back into the atmosphere due to decomposition. That means there’s a limit to the amount of CO2 that can be stored by plants at the moment? A limit far below what got stored underground? Much less than what we ate releasing into the air?
And even if it could still be stored long term like the first batch in oil and coal, that would take millions of years?

Thank you to the hundreds of people who commented, most of the advice was so useful. I might otherwise have been all accusatory and driven her away from me. Instead, after reading through all you wrote and thinking about it, I talked to her today. By now, the mark on her cheek has almost faded completely, but there is also evidence of a little bit of skin irritation like in a rash.

I went to her room, put an arm around her, gave her a kiss and said you know I've been open-minded and reasonable, but I don't think you've told me the full story about the night with your boyfriend. And  I'm afraid without the full story, I can't let you see him again without my supervision.

After lots of hesitation, she became very uncomfortable. She explained how they had been experimental in the bedroom and, not to put too fine a point on it, she had asked him to slap her face during oral sex. She had asked to be hit hard and the mark on her face was a combination of that and skin irritation probably from her face's contact with his genitals. 

You can see why this was an extremely uncomfortable conversation, but one I needed to have. She showed me his text messages from after asking multiple times a day if she was feeling better and the mark on her face had subsided, and they appeared to show genuine concern. In the last post, my instinct didn't believe her, but I do believe she's told the truth now.

I just feel so disgusted, angry, and violated, and am struggling to feel happy in general. What really kills me is that he was the one who ended our relationship, and when he was doing it he didn't mention the fact he'd cheated it, and instead  made it out like we were breaking up due to my flaws and my needing space to grow. So I have spent the last 9 months missing him terribly and beating myself up constantly for causing the demise of our relationship.

I just don't really know how to feel okay and move on from this. I just feel so immensely violated and upset by it. Any advice if anyone has been in a similar position would be appreciated. 

I know I'm lucky to no longer be with him and know who he really is now, but I'm just struggling to feel okay.

So last month, my 2 years fiancée broke up with me. She says that she doesn't love me anymore, that we had too much argues and that i never did effort for her, that i should have changed my bad things to make things better. Because since the beginning, i was often too jealous of her male friends and needing too much attention from her, talking too much when she wanted to be alone and stuff like that.... I was really an idiot, but i never really realized it... Until now... When she broke up with me, i told her that i totally understand why she wants to leave me, that i understand that she doesn't want to live with me anymore and feel restrained like this. But i also asked for a last chance, i asked to try again to be happy together. I said that i finally understood how bad i was and that i will change. But she replied me that it's too late now, she can't love me anymore, and that she already like someone else. She doesn't love him, but it's an internet friend who she loves to talk and play online games with. With their discussion, she thinks that they fit good together. But they don't flirt together or anything, she just enjoy being with him more than with me lately, which i totally understand... So since one month, i let her live totally alone, i never bother her, i let her talk and play with this guy without being jealous or anything, and i help her as much as i can to make her happier, to compensate all the shit i did to her before. And since then, things are getting better. She laughs really often with me, cuddle me when i feel bad about our problems, she started to play again with me and enjoys it (it never happened since months, she always said that she doesn't like to do things with me anymore, she always prefered to stay with her friends). She even let me pee during her shower, even if i see her naked. She says it's not a problem at all. And we still sleep together in the bed, both totally naked. We don't touch each other, or just a bit when we feel bad, but nothing lovely. Which ex does this? I don't understand why she doesn't even put underwear or something since i'm her ex now.... She could also go back to her mom, to avoid me and move on but she stays here, with me, knowing that i love her so much and want her back. She still has an heart after my name on her phone, still has a picture of us kissing as wallpaper on her phone, we are still fiancé on facebook and she told nobody about our problems, still acting as a couple. And she doesn't seem to search for an appartment. Right now we are basically a couple, just without kisses, cuddles all the time and sex.

So what should i think about all this? Is there still hope to get her back? Maybe she will stop to be interested in this internet guy living in another country and come back to me if i continue to be better for her? It hurts me so much, it's awful to live like this, i'm always crying, everyday... It's so hard to live with someone you love, seeing her naked and having really good times together while being exes.... It's destroying me, i don't know what to do...

So i need some advices and opinions about my situation, that's why i'm here. Thank you very much in advance...

Edit: yesterday evening, she was annoyed that i talk to her while she is with her internet guy, so i took it bad, cried and she came to recomfort me in the bed, naked again, and cuddled me until i sleep... I don't know if i'm really her ex tbh... I'm so lost. I want her back so much but when i ask her to come back, she always says that it's impossible and too late. But she's still here with me! It's destroying me slowly, i'm in some kind of depression since one month...

TL;DR: my fiancée broke up with me but still lives with me, sleep naked with me and doesn't say it to family and friends. What does it mean?

So I haven’t looked into too deeply. But I think the general idea rings true. 

At my work, we have a manager (Kristy) who a lot of my coworkers complain about. They says she’s mean, she yells, etc.. I know their complaints are valid because I’ve seen it. She has never once, however, yelled at me. I was pondering why that might be and I think the reason comes down to the fact I’m not *afraid* of her. If she calls me out on something and she’s right, I’ll just say “oh yeah you’re right, I’m sorry” or something along those lines. If she’s wrong and I didn’t make a mistake, I’ll correct her. There are other people in the workplace that interact with her the same way, and they get the same results. 

I don’t think you can ever gain the respect of someone you fear. Be it a boss, a teacher, a crush...if you’re afraid to stand up for yourself and speak your mind to a certain person, that will project an image of weakness to that person, and it’s hard to respect someone when they seem weak. And certain people will exploit that perceived weakness. 

It can seem like a daunting task, because sometimes your boss *is* scary. They hold power over you, and that can certainly cause anxiety. But it doesn’t take much to project strength. Basically, just don’t be a “yes man”. No one respects yes men. If someone wants you to be a yes man for them, they don’t respect you, they are using you.

Be firm, honest, and straightforward in your communication, and stick up for yourself when you need to!! You’ll be surprised how differently people start to treat you.

I (18F) and my sister (15F) have been playing sims 4 a lot this pandemic. We play on one origin account (shh) so we share all the expansion and game and stuff packs. Anyone who plays it knows that the expansion packs are expensive and add up quickly, so we tend to buy new ones intermittently. I make my own money that I'm putting away for uni so I've been frugal and I haven't been buying the ones I want at all. Meanwhile, since my sister is younger and doesn't work, my parents buy the packs she asks for like once a month or once every two months. Recently, my mom figured out that I've been frugal and that essentially sister is only getting the ones she wants and I've been holding off. So she suggested she and I discuss one we both want, and she will buy it for us as a treat. 

My sis really wants sims 4 realm of magic. I think there's absolutely nothing wrong with it, but I just don't want that one if I only get to pick one pack for this month that our parents will buy for us. It just doesn't interest me. So I suggested we get island living or get to work, and she can get realm of magic next month or something. But she won't have it.

Cut forward to a few weeks ago. My birthday was coming up, and my boyfriend wanted to surprise me with a sims 4 pack. He wasn't sure which ones I already have, so he texted my sister. She told him I want realm of magic more than anything, so that's the one he bought for me for my birthday. 

Now, I greatly appreciate his present and thoughtfulness, but she very clearly knew that I don't want that one, and wouldn't want it for my birthday. She told him that so that once he buys it on origin for me, she can also download and play it. She knew I really want island living, so she was being clearly selfish. 

I complained to my family but they just said I'm being an ungrateful brat and I should appreciate any gift I get.

In all of that I have been seeing a girl for about a year and a half now and she is amazing, problem is that during my terrible time last year I kept telling myself it wouldn't work, its over etc...and she got the brunt of all of this and she was massively in love with me. Around December I finally got back to work and back to normal in life as well thankfully! Problem is she was put through an awful time during all that to with me ending it a couple of times because of everything that was going on in my mind at the time.

I ended basically getting all that across to her and said I'm over the whole thing and came clean about it all. So thankfully she took me back, but about a week later she said she had doubts because she was scared i would do it again, so she said give her time and see what happens (this was around mid December). Problem is I'm going through massive massive anxiety thinking she'll pop up at somepoint saying she can't do it anymore and that its done! We have exchanged the odd messages inbetween then and now and a couple of days back we had a full on chat, I thought everything was going great and back on track, she said she still needed time and that was fine. I said I'll wait forever for her which I will. I've told her how much I love her and that she is genuinely is the best thing to ever happen to me love wise and having those kind of feelings for! But a couple of days back I messaged her a stupid ""naughty"" type message to (keeping in mind about a week ago we did exchange naughty texts then) and it was kind of out of the blue, she didn't reply and I have messaged her last night and today to with a video apologising and she hasn't responded to either! 

I know her and she wouldn't just end it by blanking and ignoring me! She would tell me, which she hasn't! But tbh I'm absolutely shitting myself now that I've put my foot in it and that its completely done!! 😔😔

What does everyone else think?

I should also say that barring me fucking up and putting my foot in it yesterday with that stupid message everything seemed great as I say and it looked like it was back on track, she even told me a couple of days back that she loved me etc...

We had such a good relationship when we saw eachother to and was together but it was so hard for her when I left it those times and for me now I'm a fucking mess everyday because I dont know what is going on.

This just happened about 5 minutes ago and I think I’m going to die of embarrassment 

So I am involved in a youth legal organization which serves to teach those under 18 in my city about basic criminal and civil law.  It’s a fun introduction into law for those interested in the field.

So as a member we have to do continued learning meetings online where after we are accepted we have guest legal speakers (judges, experienced attorneys,etc.) teach us more concepts before we do practice trials.

These meetings are now online through zoom and happen about twice a season.  This is where the FU begins.  I am not used to using zoom and my schooling is done through google meet which shows the microphone much more prominently.  Also i usually remember to shut off the mic before joining the meeting.  Zoom’s microphone in my opinion is a little more hidden and because of this I  forgot to turn it off and the default for some reason is set to having it on.

So the first FU consisted in joining this meeting with a district judge two attorney teachers and a guest attorney teacher with the name “Mike literus” this was NOT intentional.  I had intended to change it from when I was studying with friends through zoom for semester midterm exams before the break, but I I forgot to do it.  So that was the first FU, luckily it wouldn’t have been so bad as there were roughly 50 students in the class and nobody would have noticed one raunchy name among the dozens in the list.  

This is where the second FU comes in and makes my situation SO SO worse.  So noticing this name error I figured I would record a video that I could send to a friend who we will call bob.  I figured nobody would notice and then afterword I would change the name and bob and I would get a quick laugh over my error.  HOWEVER as I went through the recording saying “what’s my name? That’s right, Mike literus I did it bob F*** you”. 

It was at this moment that the guest lawyers face got very very stern and said “ can you please turn your Mike off” I laughed a little before noticing why.  My mike was on... my heart dropped to the ground.  I immediately panicked and went into full flight mode and left the meeting.  I tried to cover my blunder by waiting 3 minutes before rejoining and then changing my name to my actual name and making SURE my mic and camera was off.

Right now I am desperately hoping that the teaching attorneys didn’t recognize my voice or else I am in screwed.  If I’m lucky though I might just die of embarrassment

My brother has a friend [19M] who has recently been coming over semi-often. My brother has trouble making friends so I can tell he is excited to finally be hanging out with someone often.

I came downstairs not knowing his friend was over while wearing a tanktop with no bra. I wouldn't have dressed like that if I knew he was here. He was staring at my chest so I just got what I needed and went back upstairs. 

Soon after, he came up and knocked on my door. I answered (now wearing a shirt and a bra) and he told me he liked my tank top look better. I asked him what he wanted and he asked if I could show him my boobs. I said no and closed the door and stayed in my room with the door locked until he left.

I told my brother after he left what he did and he just laughed and said he would tell him to ""cut it out"". I asked him not to bring him here again and my brother said I was overreacting.

He came back another day.

This happened about a week ago. 


I was attempting to get a PS5, and apparently they were available through Sony Rewards. If you don’t know what that is, basically, you sign up for a membership, and every time you buy something, you get points. You can then use the points you’ve accumulated to buy something without having to spend any actual money. I am not a Sony rewards member. Guess how this ends. 

I naively believed that perhaps the rewards program still accepts real money, and I could get a PS5 that way. However, during my attempts I ended up locking myself out of my PlayStation account. The account uses my father’s email, which wasn’t working properly at the time, and for some strange reason I thought “well I’ll just switch it to my own email”. This did nothing. I attempted to switch back to my fathers... but my password didn’t work. I assume that switching emails canceled out the password.

In any case this meant I could not access my PSN account and I was locked out for the better part of a week. Now you’re probably wondering: “a week? OP, just reset your password”. Well first off, interrupting is rude. Second, my father’s email was working again, but it was not receiving the password reset email. We did this for the better part of the week before eventually I gave up and contacted customer support.
After going back and forth and getting the info they need (which apparently requires the serial code of the console the account was made on, meaning I had to dust off my old PS3), they eventually recovered the account and I was able to change it to my personal email. I’m never taking The PlayStation Store, or the ability to watch YouTube on a console for granted again

TL:DR: Tried to get a PS5, locked myself out of my Sony account for a week

Also, why do some people need a bigger trackpad anyways? No matter what sensitivity your computer is at, do you ever just swipe from one side of the trackpad to the other? I typically just swipe my finger in roughly a 1.5""×1.5"" square since that's all I need.

Drawing pads are obviously completely different breed, and I know for some people in business, they'll sign documents with their trackpad, but most apps allow you to save your signature. Idk, maybe this is such a niche opinion, but just watching a ton of tech/laptop videos on YouTube made me think about it.

Neither did I. It's an awful job, which pays decently but gnaws at your soul, the ultimate golden cage in a country where you're either high-tech worker or you're condemned to be poor.

Because the role is passive, and not active (you don't actually create something noticeable, but everyone notice when you don't do your work properly) people do not appreciate you, nor your time. Even worse, since the servers work 24/7, you're sometimes forced to work in unruly hours in addition to the usual 08:30-17:30, like 2-4 am even on weekends (with no extra pay, it's in the job description).My daily hell loop was waking up at 6 am, get the baby and wife ready with their breakfasts, get out of the house by 8 am, work my ass off, and get back to the house by 18:30, only to feed the baby and get him to sleep, and soon after my wife follows after she's exhausted from the day.I was basically a father-husband only for the weekends, and only assuming I won't be called from work.

So I got a life insurance, 2M $. Specifically made sure it covers suicides. I was thinking that, well, I can't be present at home to be a proper father and husband, at least the money will make sure neither of them will ever have to work. My life are worthless, and are better off like that than keep feeding the cooperate on my family's expense.

I was starting to plan it all of, but than covid hits so I got both more time with my family, and an investment I did turned our need to work obsolete. Now I can finally be a stay-at-home dad, a house-husband, and that's the most fulfilling thing I've ever did. My time is invested for my family, in my family, and around my family.

I still have the life insurance though, just in case the covid will hit me.

I was interested in testing it out, but obviously it would be kinda useless on me. So, I turned my attention to my little step-sister “Amy” (4F). She has amazingly curly hair, but no one in our families ever really do much with it, as we all have straight hair (I should clarify now that we’re all white, including Amy - none of this is a cultural issue). 

I bought all the products and we made a special day of it (at-home pamper day, the whole shebang). By some miracle, she sat for the whole thing and *loved* the results. Her curls weren’t tangled anymore, and it didn’t hurt her when I did it, unlike when either my or her mom went at it with a brush. I helped her to maintain in for the rest of the week she was at our house, seeing as she’s 4 and can’t really manage it herself yet. As a bonus aside, it was a great way for us to spend time together and I am taking great joy in currently being her “best sister” (I’m her only sister, but still). 

Then, she went back to her mum’s house, as per their custody agreement (one week at each house) and was apparently upset at the return to her mum’s approach to her hair (basically just treat it the same way you treat straight hair) and wanted my way of doing it back. Her mum then texted my step-dad (Amy’s dad) and asked that I don’t do the CGM with Amy anymore because it was too much for Amy’s mum to keep up with. I offered to send the products over, because I know they cost me £££, and figured that was the problem, and then Amy could just bring them between the houses. Amy’s mum refused and said it was just too much time to commit to Amy’s hair. It sort of escalated to Amy’s mum scolding me herself and saying that I should just “listen to the adults” and that I have no right to control how she does her daughter’s hair. 

I sympathise with Amy’s mum - I know she has two other kids who aren’t that old either and she works full time. I have the liberty of time to spend all the time I want working on Amy’s hair, unlike her. At the same time, I loved seeing how happy it made Amy and I really enjoyed our bonding time, so I’d hate to stop that now.

We were already on friendly terms so I thought it would be good idea. We gave each other our discord’s and started playing a lot of games together, and we seemed to have fun.

Although I feel as if though I keep receiving mixed messages from him. Whenever I try to just have a convo he always seems disinterested or wanting to end it as soon as possible. While also taking forever to respond (I know that people aren’t obliged to respond quickly, or at all, but it still stings a bit). Yet whenever we voice call while playing games he is always super friendly, during school as well.

I don’t have many guy friends as I usually hang out with girls so I’m not sure if this is somehow just a normal thing. Lately he called me one of his close friends which should, (obviously), mellow out my anxiety yet it still seems keen on not going away. 

As of late I’ve been thinking that me asking to play games a lot, (cause it’s usually me who asks), is somehow annoying him, or making him not like me. He usually says he’s down and we do have fun while playing but it just makes me even more guilty as if I’m somehow forcing him take time out of his day to play.

So, am I just being insane about this all? I’m very bad at reading people so it most likely is the case. Or could it also be that he’s just a busy, dry texter but doesn’t mean to come off as rude.

words of affirmation is my love language. it's something that i've realised i really need in a relationship. my girlfriend is sometimes amazing with this and really does make me feel so loved. but other times i just don't get that from her. and like i said, it's something i really need.

so my question is, is this something ""appropriate"" to bring up? is it worth mentioning? am i being too selfish and irrational?

We have a healthy and happy relationship, aside from my issues with past abuse and cheating(he is patient and understanding when I overreact or question him). 
He was single for three years before me and lived his single guy life and decided he wanted to find someone to settle down with. As a couple, while we plan to get married and have kids, we still enjoy partying and having fun together, since we were both into that lifestyle before. We tell each other everything, within reason of course. Basically, everything is great. 
I took a trip to Florida without him, but it was Disney, with my mom and sister. Very different vibe. This was a sort of on a whim decision from his bestie, who planned/booked the whole thing for them. He hasn’t gotten to travel much, but really wants to. I love him and feel he deserves to go on trips, whether I’m there or not. I know he and his friends love gambling and warm weather (it’s not warm where I’m at), and that’s why they are going. My last partner would always act broke, but he wasn’t, he was paying for prostitutes and I was taking care of him. He’d do it on the way home from work, or at our home while I was at work. He also beat me up. My previous partner would coerce me into group sex situations I wasn’t comfortable with. The one before that fell in love with someone else. It’s been a pattern. 
So... I’m nervous af. It’s only for three days. He’s been loving and reassuring about everything. He’s promised me that he will tell me if anything happens, but says it definitely won’t. 
I don’t know how to calm down. I’m making plans with friends as much as I can, or trying to see it at catch up time for myself, or me time. I’m just nervous I’m going to have a hard time not blowing up his phone. He said we will video chat every day, like when I went on my trip.

Having formed a friendship and a degree of attraction on my part, I went for it, went all in, took her hand and said all of the things you would say to someone that you had care for and asked her if she would marry me, she asked if I was serious, so I said yes of course I am, if that gives you safety and security of being a US citizen, of course yes I am serious.

Eventually I ask her out again on a date but this one is online. She seems down for it and suggests what we’re gonna make while I pick a movie to watch (typical dinner and a movie). Fast forward to this past Wednesday the night before our date she messages me how she has to cancel because she has to move since she doesn’t feel safe where she is and is going to stay with a friend. Apparently her landlord got kicked out and is “mentally unwell.”  Honestly I didn’t really know what to say at the time so I just said “that’s unfortunate but better to be safe than sorry in that situation. Let me know how everything goes?”  And left it at that. Haven’t heard from her since and haven’t messaged her since.

We have a 2 year old together. 

We've had a rocky history. We had a really good relationship up until 4ish years ago. He decided to bring a gun into our home, behind my back. Knowing full well that I wasn't okay with it. No discussion at all, he just brought it home one day. I was upset and we talked about it. Eventually I felt that we had worked it out and he agreed to no more guns, just the one for home defense. He agreed to keep it in a safe. He asked me to marry him a few months later and we got married a few months after that. 

Right before we got married he disclosed his financial situation. He was about 15k in credit card debt. He had extensive dental work done and was living in a very high cost if living area for a long time with a minimum wage job. He had just landed a job that paid 3x his old salary, so he said his first priority was to pay it off. We ended up using a wedding gift to pay it and I lended him some money as well that he paid back. 

All was good for a year. We ended up buying a house (I'm a compulsive saver and had the money for a down payment). I got pregnant soon after and everything was good. 

When I was 8 months pregnant, he brought home 2 more guns without discussion. If i wasn't pregnant, I would have left on the spot. It wasn't necessarily the guns, it was the fact that he went behind my back and did something that he knew I wouldn't be okay with. My trust was gone. I felt back into a corner. He had 'already paid for them' so he had to keep them. Which I know now is total bullshit. He knew how to guilt me into letting him keep them. 

About a year ago, I found out that he had applied for a concealed carry permit and was in the process of getting it approved. I obviously was upset. This was another thing he went behind my back to do. I asked if there was anything else he was hiding, he said that he was 25k in credit card debt. I couldn't believe it. In 2 years, knowing we were having a baby and just bought a house and making 3x what he used to, he had racked up that much debt. We had agreed to keep a joint account for bills and seperate accounts for fun money. He had credit cards I didn't know about. 

We had a long discussion, he agreed it was bad, and has since been paying down his debt. He agreed to not pursue the concealed carry and focus on getting his debt down. 

A few months ago I found out that he had restarted the concealed carry process without telling me and had been approved. He had to tell me because he needed to take a class on one of his days off and I had told him I had an appointment that day. So he had to come clean because he wasn't going to be home during my appointment. 

We had a very long conversation, we compromised and he got the permit. Because it was already paid for and he would resent me if I didn't let him. 

Now I'm living with so much resentment. It's mostly because I just don't trust him. I don't know how to let this go. We did have a conversation and came to an agreement. But I hate the agreement. I wanted to keep the peace to try and work it out. I remember the conversation we had, but I feel like it's still unresolved. 

We're going to go to couples counseling later this year. Which I know is the real answer to this problem. But in the meantime, how do I stop hating him? I'm fine for a few weeks and then I just feel rage about all the things that happened. I want to remind him about his debt every time he make a large purchase. I want to be mean and tell him to have fun going out and being rambo when he puts on his gun to go to the grocery store. Or tell him I don't know why he's so worried about other people killing him when he's killing himself (he's prediabetic and not doing a thing about it). I don't know how to stop feeling like this.

As an extrovert, I though he would tell me straight away when being unhappy or when something is wrong, but somehow instead he just kept it to himself and I only learned when it was too late. Last week we bit touched on it, but it just felt like a breaf mention and I really didn't truly understand what he means. I think I was maybe quite thick skulled, but I thought he would tell me if he felt like something was wrong. Few days ago we finally broke up and I temporarily left the house - I thought to give him space and time but the distance also made me realise so many things I haven't seen before - I have to admit I really was quite selfish partner and very blinded by my depression and basically it was quite a lot about me and my needs and less so about his.

The worst thing is, that I just didn't see it myself - until now. As said, the worst probably is that this wasn't even how I usually am - I'm usually quite the opposite, but this intense crisis and loosing my job had just changed me - I was in a fit of deep depression, which I just genuinely didn't realise. I thought he would talk more through things, point them out and then we will try to fix them together, work on them, but now he just wants to figure out what he wants from life and get some alone time by moving out of our shared apartment. He also said he needs to figure stuff about himself, like if he actually wants kids (or was it just because of me as I wasn't sure?) and also to more connect with his very religious and conservative family, which was a bit uprehensive about me in a first place. (I thought it was again nothing irrepairable, as he himself mentioned but still)

I dunno... I just really hoped I would be given chance to fix stuff, because I just felt like didn't know about them properly before. Now when we've finally talked about it and hearing me I just only realised I was such a shabby partner and knowing I would be willing to be work on them and be more of my old self after doing this uncosciously, he said he believes me but is just also existentially in shards and really doesn't know what to do. He feels he just need to be alone for some time, maybe forever.

The thing is it's terrible he felt so bad for maybe 6 months now, but in my book, I really didn't feel like he ever actually properly mentioned it to me, so I would understand. So I feel so hurt because I feel like there wasn't even an actual chance to fix things from my part, I just didn't understand.

I'm really so hearthbroken and wonder if distance could make him want to actually really try again, when we are now both on the same page - both fully understand what the problem really was. But then again he felt like I was horrible person for 6 months, but how does one fix their shortcomings if they were simply not aware of them. Do you think there's chance of him possibly coming back? Do introverts ever miss their exes after breaking up with them or ever feel lonely after breakup?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My introverted so broke up with me, without me understanding what was wrong - until now.

It’s like riding a bike. My balance comes back and my daughter is even starting to get the hang of it. Enter my toddler son, home from the grocery store. He of course wants to play outside too and grabs his balance bike. My wife heads inside to put groceries away and start dinner. 

Inevitably, son falls down and twists the handlebar of his bike out of alignment with the wheel. I go to rescue him. 

I’ve managed the driveway-to-curb transition many times today, but I’d course this is the time I blow it. I overcorrect back, my feet fly forward and out from under, and I land squarely on my tailbone (just barely missed landing flat on my back). 

I write this while soaking in the tub and waiting for the Tylenol to kick in, hoping that tomorrow does not feature a trip to the Urgent Care for a steroid shot and prescription. 

I’ll be back on the skates as soon as I’m able, though. The important part is to get back up after the fall.

Hello friends. I need some help regarding some memories that are floating in my brain, and I wish to know if I am right in the inkling of my brain of something potentially wrong.

The first one, the ""worser"" one, was as a young girl, my mother was a nurse. I think at the time I had some slight pain in my urethra. I recall her wiping some sort of paste on my vaginal area, and then also.. well inside with her finger. As I laid back on her bed. I don't recall how long this went for. As an adult I have never used or heard of a cream that goes inside or outside (especially since the problem was my urethra and not vaginal canal). Was this CSA? I was very young at the time but it sticks out in my mind. I don't know what the cream was or why and I hadn't been prescribed anything by a doctor. Is there a cream like this and I just don't know?? My mother was a nurse at the time.

Then, growing up I developed very quickly. My mother would humiliate me and make me cry and overwhelm me while bra shopping, trying to make me put on ""pretty""/""sexy"" ones when I was probably 12 and just wanted a normal sports bra. I was already bullied at the time for my chest. One time she felt them while I was in the bath. I don't know if she was doing a breast exam (remember, she was a nurse). But I was very young and I don't know if breast exams were done on girls that young. I remember her being in the change rooms with me when trying on bras and once made me leave the change room for her to look at me and some random lady was there and commented on me/my breasts.

Finally, when I was 15/16, I know this one was fucked up. In Australia we have a 'formal' (so, prom), but mine had a 'semi-formal' which was probably more of a cocktail/dance party in year 10/11. While getting changed in her room, which I suppose she insisted on, I was pulling on one of those corset bra things, and she attempted to take photos of me until I rightfully flipped the fuck out. I had no pants on, just pulling on this bra thing.

Am I correct in being sleeved out? Do any nurses or medical professionals have any input? Or mothers in their child rearing experience? I've absolutely had psychological damage in the self esteem and appearance part of my life, it's only recently bra shopping isn't painful to me.

I had a hard time distilling the story so I didn’t really do one. 

So here it is: I carried a bullet into a courthouse on accident. This upset the police. 

Cool? Cool. 

This happened over 20 years ago. Still makes me cringe.

This is a little complicated but I’ll try to make it quick.

I was a foster kid from Chicago. Every few months there would be a court hearing at a large urban courthouse to check in on how I was doing, what I was doing etc.

When I was 17, they found distant relatives for me to live with in Indiana. 

I was dating  a guy who was way too old for me, had served in Iraq , and was a gun nut. I complained to him that someone at work kept hitting on me, not taking no for an answer, and I didn’t know what to do. 

My boyfriend gave me a *hollow point bullet* and told me to give the guy the bullet, and then tell him if he didn’t leave me alone, “the next would be coming much faster.*

Cue to eye roll and tossing said bullet into my purse. Forget it’s there.

Did I mention that I frequently went to court? In another state? In a particularly violent urban area? I drop my purse on the x-ray machine and go through the metal detector. 

Shit gets really concerning, really fast. I am surrounded by police. With weapons demanding to know where the gun is at. What gun? I don’t have a gun....

Slowly it dawns on me that I have a hollow point bullet, in a courthouse, in an area where weapons are not allowed, nor I’m pretty sure was legal to bring from Indiana to Illinois. I’m not sure. But I was 17, stupid, and had some explaining to do.

They surround me. I am being patted down. They continue to demand me to tell them where I have the gun. I don’t remember all I said to get myself out of this situation but I do distinctly remember saying “I’m living in Indiana, we don’t use guns to shoot people there.” Like that would help. Eventually one of my case workers sees the commotion and that I’m in the middle of it. They come and talk to the officers who are looking more and more incredulous that I was indeed that stupid. 

They let me go. 25 years later I still want to crawl into a hole and thank the universe for being such an incredible idiot that the cops took pity on me.

tl/dr: Court. Bullet. Purse. Bad.

London Hughes states shes never been called a bitch to her face,  and Mike Eagle says he's never called someone a bitch,  and doesn't even use the word. 

It got me thinking. I'm a pretty vulgar man,  and I've gotten into many an argument in my life, and with guys,  we'll all call eachother every name under the sun when we're mad. But any time I've ever gotten into a heated debate or even outright argument with a woman,  I've never called her a bitch, or any other derogatory term to her face,  even if later I said while discussing it, ""She was being a bitch"" or something similar.

Now there are tons of guys out there who probably call every woman they see a bitch,  or worse, but I think the vast majority of men are like myself,  in that they just don't insult women like that, at least not to their face, even when really angry.

I imagine every woman has run into one or two of those guys with no filter who just gets pissed and says ""Whatever, bitch"" or something similar. But if it's happened more than once or twice, (or a small handful more than that, depending on your age) maybe, just maybe.... you're a bitch.

It has become a tradition by now.

This year I have tried really hard to make it more interesting: created a story with its own lore and characters in which he was a detective and had to solve the mystery, I spent good money to use actual chains, locks, magic mirrors, etc... to do it rather than just bad hand-made stuff, created several chatbots to narrate the story, made ""deepfake"" videos with the characters narrating their lives, used lots of QR codes so it's interactive with new technologies, bought GPS locators and designed a map around the area... you name it, the point is I put on a lot of time, effort and money into this and today is the last night when almost everything is done, I just need to go leave each lock, clue, etc... where they belong and that's it.

The thing is, my brother's behavior lately have been rubbing me off the wrong way. In my opinion he has become bratty and takes it for granted even though it's just something I do out of pure will, and rather than being interested in it he just leaves me doing all the hard job while he just demands more and more. For example, he's always threatening to quit if things don't go his way ""I hate that character, if you include it I won't do the Escape Room!"", ""I refuse to go to the basement, if you make me to I'll just quit"", ""wow, you spent so much in the Escape Room! That's stupid, I wish you have had bought me more expensive presents rather than this, I won't play!!!"", etc... this has gotten me frustrated because he was the one who insisted on doing it to begin with, and now that I spent all that time and money refuses to go through it. Had I know he would have this reaction, I wouldn't have prepared anything to begin with. I still kept going because I thought something along the lines of ""well, I already spent that money and so much time doing it any ways, it would be stupid to quit now"" but about an hour away something got me on my nerves pretty bad.

It's 22:43 and I'm in a cold room in a hotel preparing the game while my brother is at home, and I decided to text and send him the event poster with a message along the lines of ""check it out, poster done! Are you ready for tomorrow? :)"" since he was online. He left me on read.

I thought he was busy or something like that but nope, after several messages and after asking if he was gonna really leave me like that (on read) he did. He's still online and hasn't replied back.

For some reason this pissed me off more than the other comments the previous days. Like, why the hell am I putting so much effort and money into this if he is so ungrateful?

This happened back in 2011, when I was just 7. As a young sports fan in Rhode Island who was starting to get to know his local sports teams (Patriots, Celtics, Red Sox, etc). My first day of school was in August, and I was one of those kids who had to stay in an extended day program where you hang out with teachers until your parents pick you up. My parents didn't neglect me or anything like that, it was because of their jobs and they didn't want me taking a school bus. One of the teachers who ran the program was an old woman named Mrs. Brady. So when I first met her, I was convinced she was Tom Brady's mother, because, well, same last name and I didn't know any better at the time. I didn't bother to ask, I was just convinced. In October, our school hosted a Halloween party, and Mrs. Brady said she was bringing her son. I was thinking in my mind, ""oh my goodness, I'm about to meet Tom Brady!""

Fast forward to the Halloween party, and I came in with my hopes up. I saw Mrs. Brady, and she pointed out her son, throwing around a football. I was totally thinking, ""oh my God! It's Tom Brady!"" Thank God I didn't say it out loud, because...

It wasn't Tom Brady. His name wasn't even Tom. I don't remember his real name, but I was disappointed.

He’s all about women are all the same and all bitches cuz they are so full of themselves.) 

So this guy just keeps moaning (like he is aroused) for whatever reason, had a bad day and told him to leave if he keeps doing it. 

Skip to a week or two later, avoided him like the pest. Sat together with two friend when said guy joins us again and moans AGAIN. Me trying to right myself and give him another chance calmed myself down and explained to him that it makes me really uncomfortable and politely ask him to stop it. 

He stays quiet for two minutes and then all of a sudden „you HAVE to explain that to me. Are you homophobic or something? No one has ever asked me such a weird thing.“ 

Well me being me I call him a retard and that the fact he just happens to be gay does not have anything to do with the fact that I don’t want to hear strangers moan. That it is a thing that is very sensible and so on. Can’t really remember everything I said honestly but asked my friends later on and they said I was surprisingly calm. (Except for the retard thing I guess.. oh well.)

So the next day I receive a massage that if we are on our friends TeamSpeak I am supposed to mute him because we wouldn’t get along very well. I agree with the getting along part but honestly muteing him would just.. make it weird I guess? At least for everyone else. 

So i Tell him I already avoid him and I won’t mute him cuz it makes it weird and that he is being inconsiderate and disrespectful.

Sends me a long ass text saying that I am the only one weird asking him shit like that and that it is basically asking him to laugh differently and wanting him to change who he is etc.

Ps: just to make it clear. I do not have a problem with his sexual orientation or the fact that he is living his live proudly. I’m happy for him to be himself. The only thing I can’t wrap my head around is the fact that he can’t respect that he is obviously triggering something in me with this noise. 

Edit: explanation to what I mean by moaning. The noise you make during sex. And it’s mostly when no one says anything that he does it.

Edit 2: basically like first edit just made it clearer in the post. Sorry English is not my first it didn’t come to my mind that it has more meanings. :)

So I met this girl on Facebook in a social group we started talking and we instantly hit it off she's the female version of me (29M) : she's an introverted person doesn't go out much likes to share memes we like the same stuff sexually, etc. So after about a month of talking we developped feelings for each other and we were planning on meeting up (so far we were only communicating with messenger and video calls) but she has social anxiety so meeting strangers is very hard for her and every time we planned on meeting up she ghosted me at the last minute... At first I thought maybe it was because she was nervous and every time she apologized but after the third time I felt like I was getting played so I blocked her and stopped talking to her but because I still had feelings for her I unblocked her and started talking to her again then we decided not to rush things and one day she wanted to meet with me and she ghosted me again so i said fuck this I'm done.

Fast forward about a year she hits me up again randomly saying that she was thinking about me and all of a sudden all the feelings I had for her went right back up and I forgave her and we started talking again more like friends. It's been about 2-3 months now and everything seemed fine but now she barely talks to me I always have to initiate the conversation and every time I ask her what she's been up to she tells me not much (which makes me think that she doesn't even think about giving me a sign of life)

So should I just give up on her or keep trying to talk to her ?

We know he won’t give her up, and after speaking to one of his family members it seems he’s willing to have 50/50 custody.

I love comic books so I wear a lot of comic book characters and graphics on hoodies and shirts. 

For Christmas my brother and his wife got me a lot of new clothes. And I'm talking about everything like shirts, socks, pants (not sweat pants more so like jeans), underwear, button down shirts and even a few belts. It was really a lot of stuff and I really appreciated the gift. My brother told me that since I'm in high school now and growing up that I need to dress more grownup like, instead of all my colorful clothes. The issue with the clothes him and his wife got me is that they're so bland and just not really my style. I didn't agree with him when he said that I needed to dress grown up, but I didn't tell him because I didn't want to look ungrateful. I feel bad for not liking the clothes they got me, especially since they got me a lot. I just didn't like how the clothes looked since they were all just boring solid color materials. I also tried a few on and didn't like the feel, especially the pants because I much rather prefer sweat pants or looser pants. It's not because they weren't the right size they were definitely the right size just that they were made to fit tighter it seems.

And he is very good at gambling apparently (if that's even a thing it seems more luck than skill) as an account that he opened up to get his stimulus check deposited back is now up over $20,000.

I am really scared because now that I noticed it I can't unsee it. I always suspected certain things but I never could explain them clearly.

I feel shitty just for writing this because I love him and I know that he's having a hard time. He works in healthcare and it's bollocks at the moment. But also I don't know how to be closer to him and help him. He always denies that his job may affect how he feels or his behaviour and he always says that he's ok. 

TL; TR: When I am mad at something and I have any kind of reaction, he gets mad at me and says that my reaction was out of proportion, he screams and yells, then throws in a half-ass apology - I'm sorry, but... -about something that it's maybe just partially related to the reason I was angry in the first place, and then he pretends that I apologize for the way I treated him. 

He often says that I NEVER apologise, and when I make him notice that I actually do he says that I only do at the end and not at the beginning as he does...

The thing is that often I don't really feel like my reactions are so disproportionate or out of control as he says.

I used to be very anxious/depressed and I would deal with stuff in a very passive-aggressive manner, often stonewalling or making a deal out of everything, but the more I seem to get better at managing and expressing my feelings the worse he gets, and he still treats me and reacts like I'm still doing those things, even if it's been years. Before he was accomodating, or at least he was trying to reason with me, now he jumps and reacts immediately, he goes into a monologue mode where he talks and talks and then if he doesn't feel seen or understood- which usually happens, I try to defend my position because I'm upset too - he yells and screams. 

When he reaches that state I usually -not so much recently, I've been more lucid - went blank and couldn't talk anymore, but just cry, shake and dissociate. I tried to explain to him how it was making me feel and he swore that it would have never happened again. I said that I felt annihilated. It did happen again, almost every single time, with the difference that now he tries to refrain himself from doing monologues and he doesn't interrupt me and then he apologises for having yelled. But sometimes he also mocked me when I was crying and shaking saying things like ""well great, now you feel *annihilated*, don't you?""

The thing is that even if I'm wrong, or I get angry or say bad stuff, I never go as far as say this kind of things or name call him. But he says that it doesn't matter because I have other ways to make him feel bad: the tone, the silence, the sarcasm. 

The argument is usually over when we are both drained out, I cried my eyes and soul out and we both apologised. Often while also admitting -believing it- to be self-centred, aggressive, that I should treat him better and that I need to change. Now I'm re-evaluating about how true this is and how it may have influenced my self-esteem and what I think about myself. 

Two days ago when he came back home I confronted him about something he did. It was clearly done not on purpose, but it was disgusting and I had to clean it. He tried to deny that he did it -which was already weird, it was impossible that I did it- then he asked me several times if I was sure that I truly saw what I saw, and every time I explained it with more details it was followed up by another ""but are you really sure?"". He denied again that he did it and then he suddenly started talking as I was unreasonably asking him to change a habit that he has which is related to the problem we were discussing. But I wasn't. I just stated the facts: I found this, I had to clean it, I didn't like it. I haven't added anything else to the matter so that was completely unrelated. At that point I lost my cool because it just felt like it was way to not have to deal with the subject and I felt manipulated. and also sad because I realized that it was something that I wouldn't have noticed before. I would have just been dragged into a new argument without even realizing it. I tried to cut it down short and said that I know he didn't do it on purpose but I told him to prevent it from happening again. Then he kept on playing at the computer and I was in another room. When he said that he was going to bed I just replied ""ok"", and he asked me why I was being cold and distant for the whole evening. He said that he said that non-related thing because he was trying to find a solution so that what I was complaining about wouldn't happen again but he couldn't explain it properly because I was TOO ANGRY. Overwhelming angry. For the record, just before he came back home I finished an online meditation session that went on for five hours. I WAS VERY RELAXED. He said that I attacked him immediately and that I accused him - he still didn't believe that he did the thing -, he still suggested that I may have done it, and then said that I was so angry that I was shaking. I was indeed angry, and I said what I said firmly, without sugarcoating it, but I think there is a difference between that and being aggressive. We discussed for I don’t know how long how of how angry and out of control I am. I said that discussing this was tacking us away from the main issue, but according to him “there was nothing to talk about regarding that”. He said that I didn't want to find solutions, I just wanted to get back at him and humiliate him. It wasn't a situation where one can find a solution, it was something unpleasant, that clearly happened as a mistake since it never happened before, but it was EXTRA GROSS so I was quite angry about it. I tried to stay calm and answer to everything he said logically, forcing myself to stick to my views and not getting dragged into other matters. He kept denying that he did the thing but he still ""apologised"" for it, saying “for the sake of it let’s say that I did it”. When there was nothing else he could answer back he started getting angrier and angrier. He switched to the yelling mode. He said that I don't understand anything, that I’m an idiot, and kept repeating that I was attacking him. I made him notice that he was clearly the one that was attacking me at that point and he became totally incoherent. He said that he was disappointed in me. That he came back from work and all he wanted was to stay with me and I was cold and said nothing nice to him for the whole evening. He said that I should recognise that I was hurtful and that I attacked him in the first place. I didn't and he went to bed and started CRYING. I've known him for 10 years and I saw him cry 3 times and that was absolutely nothing I would expect him to cry for. I didn't know what to do because I was afraid that he would have rejected me and the whole thing was surreal. Then he came back again and demanded that since he apologised, I had to apologise too for the way I behaved, because ""there are always two sides to an argument"". Every time I tried to say that he didn't really apologise he interrupted me and he was boiling with rage. He said that if I didn’t realise what I did and apologise we were done. That it doesn’t matter that I think that it’s not true that I was aggressive to him because that’s how he perceived me, and I taught him that - he was referring to other arguments we had where he said things that were hurtful to me but he didn't think they were-. I didn't back up and he had a full meltdown. He said that we were done, I was shocked and I tried to keep talking and he kept yelling NO, WE'RE DONE, WE'RE DONE. Then he laid on the floor and started sobbing. I went to him and tried to comfort him and at that point, I apologised... 

He never had a reaction like that.

I don't know what to do. 

I think he's broken and I don't know what to do. 

The whole argument I never name called him, I never yelled. I cried - a bit less than usual. I tried to use descriptive language, I never said ""you did this"", or ""this is wrong"", ""this is gross"", ""you are like this"". I just only, literally said: ""this happened and I didn't like it"", and then tried to use logic when I felt he was derailing. The only wrong thing that I think I did was that I laughed with a scoff to some remarks he made because I was frustrated by the whole thing and I was clearly seeing how he was trying to skew things. 

He felt not seen and not understood. At the same time, I don't know how I could have been more open or warm to him without having to admit that I was aggressive irrational and I behaved like a monster. I felt he gave me no choice to submit or make him feel submitted. 

Also, he promised he never threatened to leave me if he doesn't really mean it. I confronted him again about this and he said that he did really mean it at that moment, but after he said it he was too scared of a life without me and he broke down. He doesn't even realise that this is the definition of saying something without truly meaning it and having fully thought about it. 

Today things are better and he's been very loving, but I know that he has no idea of how skewed this behaviour his and I know for certain that if he would read this he would say that half of this is not true and that I am still not considering his point of view. 

I don't know what to do. What can I do to handle these situations better? I will speak to my therapist about it, but I'm also writing here because I need other human beings approval, I guess?

We (her: w 33; me: m 32) went to school together sice age 11 and became good friends around three years ago. I always fancied her and finally I fell in love about two years ago. Nothing much happened until last december, when we finally got together, so we are only together for a few weeks now (the first kiss around a week before christmas). We agreed not to tell anyone at this stage (not even our parents), because she wanted to take it slow and see what happens.  I was as happy as can be and really excited about the coming month and years, because I am really serious about this relationship. 

Now the issue: During the weeks since christmas we saw each other like two times a week and we discussed a lot of things. Most of the times I stayed over night, because we have COVID-curfew in the evening here in Germany. We always met at her place, because she couldn't visit me (again COVID related) and ate dinner with her parents. During our walks in the evening, we also discussed future topics like where we could imagine living together or if we wnt to have children. And that's was when the problems started. For me these discussions were serious, but soooo far in the future and so many steps ahead, it was basically more a alignment of ideas for the future. For her it was dead serious. Basically we agreed on most of the things, but one main issue. She explained that it was her lifelong dream to have a multigenerational house with her parents (which I met like 5 times...).

Now at this moment I fucked up and said something like ""yea... I could imagine that..."", not realizing how serious it was for her already (also i meant it honest). A few days later she began to talk about how we could reconstruct her parents house, take a 500k loan and have children. I was a bit dumbstruck and asked what timeframe she imagined for that. She answered ""The diggers don't have to be here by march, but pretty soon!"". Holy Moly my heart. The next time I tried to argue that that's a bit too early for me and that I think we just need some time to be a couple and (even if we already know each other for a long time) need to know each other better *as a couple*. Also I said I'm not fully sold about that multigenerational houshold for many reasons, including not knowing her parents...In my panic I also tried to cover as much ""important"" topics for me as possilbe, like faith and tried to feel out what she thinks about it. 

So now we are in crisis. Her basic argumentation is that if I love her I should have confidence that we can find a comprimise for all possible problems and there is no reason at all to wait for anything. She argues that if I'm not sure now after knowing her for so long, we should end it right now. For me it's after only a few weeks as couple really really too early to decide on those topics. And yes, I DO love her and I AM sure about our relationship. But I think, even if two people really love each other, things still could not be working out and you should just have a relationship a bit longer before commiting to a loan or children... 

So, what so you think I should do in this situation? Am I seeing thing wrong?  
How would you adress this topic the next time and do you have any general advice for me?  


Thanks a lot for all replies!

I (21f) have been in a long distance relationship with (21m) since we were both 19. Idk if this is necessary but at the time I had a 10 month old son (now almost 3) his Dad was never around and bf knows this as well as his dad was mentally abusive. He didn’t mind being a father figure and said this w/o me asking. We haven’t got the chance to see eachother in person because he’s in the army and stationed on the other side of the country. In case I get asked if he was lying about that, I FaceTimed with him many times and I got to see the base a bit as well as some of his friends. He did get leave twice but the first time I told him not to see me because I was kinda mad (we weren’t together yet) and the second time he couldn’t because he had a personal family affair (idk if this is true or not. That almost caused me to break up with him but I didn’t because well, I couldn’t. He knows this and promised to do better. Anyway last year in February he was deployed overseas for 9 months and didn’t come back till November. He wasn’t in a war zone (thank god) But when he came back I noticed he was different emotionally. Believe me my mind was all over the place thinking did something happen, did I do something? And over time, the time it would take to get a response was several hours. And it’s really blurry what happened after that but then he started saying I need a moment. So I gave him a moment and then texted him if he’s okay, he said no and he needs a break from everything. He didn’t give a reason and still won’t. I was sad because at the time he asked for it, I was going through a lot of stuff as my home life is not good. He doesn’t know this but to handle both was hard. I don’t wanna go more in on texts but time went by and lately 5 days ago, I dm him on IG also to add he did unfollow me on IG a couple months back which was weird and since then snapchat too (I think he changed his number or blocked me) and was kinda admit telling him I still care and I am loyal to us (as he told me he would be when he asked for a break) and if he wasn’t feeling it anymore to tell me so we can end here and I’m not waiting for a change. I didn’t hear from him for a day or so untill I double texted WHY?? And he said to relax and give him time.

So the friend of friend in question I never got along with. Since they had mod powers and I didn't he would regularly use them against me. This day in question was the last straw with them.

So basically, mutual had just muted me after me being dumb (He made it a rule later that you couldn't). As I was trying to tell him off after I was unmuted I noticed they changed my nickname. He changed it to ""belongs on a cross"". Hell basically ensued with one of my friends joining the server and a lot of stuff happened.

Owner contacts me and starts getting mad over the situation. I explain that I did not appreciate what it was and we had a massive argument. He said that ""it was only a joke"" and I got pissed. I explained that he managed to get one friend to start to not like him anymore and a lot of other stuff not mentioned here.

The next day I blocked him and mutual and left the server and stopped all contact. I feel incredibly guilty though since not only did I piss a lot of people off (since the other mods started to dislike me from what I am told) and also because the friend who mentioned not liking the owner had asked me not to say, I feel really guilty (said friend said its ok though).

Myself, my parents and my brother were watching this show where someone was saying that ginger was an anagram for ‘a word that we can’t say,’ which was evidently the n word. However my dad was unable to comprehend that they were referring to that word and asked what they were talking about, and my mum outright said the n-word.

I told her that that wasn’t unacceptable, in any circumstances and she said that ‘it wasn’t with any malice, as long as she didn’t say it in the company of any black people’ and my dad instantly jumped in to defend her and said that ‘if he hadn’t asked the question, she wouldn’t have said it, and he would’ve needed more clarification if she had just said ‘the n word’ rather than actually voicing the slur itself.’ I thought that was entirely unreasonable and I told them so, because my parents who are pretty educated and non-conservative, should be able to grasp that ‘the n-word’ refers to the slur, without saying it - they know what it means and I didn’t think it needed to be vocalised, I got upset and continued to say that it was completely unnecessary to say it, and it’s harmful to the black community even if it has innocent intentions because we’re not black.

Usually I turn to my brother for help because he’s less conservative than them and he’s only 21 but when I looked to him, he looked pissed off and shook his head at me, gesturing to my parents in some way that made me think that I should listen to them? 

My mom said she thought my ‘political correctness’ was getting out of hand and I tried to explain to her it’s still a slur, and it’s got nothing to do with that. I guess if she had just apologised for saying it, I might’ve been okay but she kept going to such great lengths to defend it that I think that she really does believe that in any context where she’s not around black people, it’s okay to say it.

I just came out of a mouth surgery and they shut me down quite readily and I tried to protest but they kept telling me to ‘stop speaking or I might dislodge my stitches’ and I think it was because they really just didn’t want me to keep speaking about it. Again, I tried to be as reasonable as possible but I can’t really convey that over the internet to people reading this, so take this part with a grain of salt. 

EDIT: I understand in some historical contexts/literature contexts it can be very hard to avoid/unavoidable, however I believe it was avoidable in this circumstance knowing that my parents know how the slur is spelt etc, and their unwillingness to listen makes me worried about repeat situations/further normalisation of its use in daily convo",0,0,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,self,AITA for getting upset that my mom said the n-word?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/kuzj3e/aita_for_getting_upset_that_my_mom_said_the_nword/,all_ads,52.5

He lived with our family for a great deal of time, grew up with my older brothers and is even known as our brother.  I actually didn't know he wasn't my blood brother until I was like 9. He calls my dad ""dad"" and  visits our family home as normal.

A few nights ago we were drinking and listening to music at my dad's home where I live. (Craig lives with his wife about 20  minutes away.) I happened to be really dolled up that day and to which he complimented me SEVERAL  times. 

He later kept AGGRESSIVELY trying to (and succeeding) touch me, kiss me, lick me up and down. He professed his 'love' for me and kept saying that the family should've known this should happen one day. He kept saying that the family knows he would take care of me and how well he would treat me etc. 

I tried to get him (drunk) to leave several times over the course of 5 hours even   leading him to his car at least 8 times.  ( I would later find out that night  he'd already been drinking before visiting me and that he really is a functional alcoholic). 

I tried to laugh off his advances, I tried to playfully decline, I tried saying stop several time (to which he responded favorably sometimes), I tried reminding him of his wife. And so much more... Should I have yelled at him? 

Eventually I gave into one of his forceful kisses... (I honestly could hardly breathe as I was holding my mouth closed as to not allow his tongue into my mouth). 

He expressed (while sober and drunk) that he was sorry and felt like an a\*\*hole and then eventually went home early the next morning. I told him we're good and what happens between me and him stays that way. I'm not upset with him. Basically I tried to ease the awkwardness of the situation by blaming it on the alcohol. 

I really did look at him as a brother.... Not anymore. 

\--

Why didn't I just put him in his place from the beginning... 

Idk, weak boundaries? Or maybe just the shock of the situation?

Anyway, what's next... what do I do next? How do I process this? Do I speak with him  one on one  ? Do I pretend that nothing happened?

He's a pretty nice guy, very sweet and caring. I love him a lot and we respect each other and our boundaries. His parents on the other hand, I have absolutely NO respect for.

(just an FYI: his parents don't know we're dating for reasons I will clarify later, and apologies for the long read!)

He's almost 21 years old, and he still gets into arguments and screaming matches with his parents about being allowed to *leave the house on his own*. They're incredibly controlling all the time. No leaving the house for ANYTHING without permission in advance (and them granting permission is few and far between). If he wants to see his friends more than once a week it's ""too many times in a row"". He can't access his own bank account because his dad won't let him. His parents also keep important info from him and make it extremely difficult to get (SSN, etc), which has been making it extra hard for him to get a job. His parents also won't let him work at a physical job (retail, etc). He's in university right now studying something he hates because his parents expect him to go into a profitable field. His parents routinely go through his stuff, to the point where he's paranoid to have practically anything in his room besides the barebones bed and desk. He can't wear the clothing he wants, and his mom has been known to steal or throw away clothes that she doesn't want him to wear. They regularly berate him for being a failure of a son. At one point his mom literally banned him from ever texting, calling, or chatting with his friends ever again because she thought we were all ""bad influences"" on him because he was outed as bisexual after she went through his phone. She thought we were influencing him to ""become gay"".  One time when he was driving us both to get some food together, his dad *tailed us* in his car the entire time, watching us to make sure we weren't doing anything he wouldn't approve of. Not to mention that his parents have been physically abusive in the past and have thrown stuff at him, or threatened violence.

Not only are they homophobic, but they're transphobic and racist as well. I'm a trans man, and they've said extremely transphobic things about me behind my back, and at one point encouraged him to be friends with me because he could ""fix me"". His dad made it very clear that if he ever ended up dating/marrying a man, that he would be disowned and he would never be able to carry the family name, which is why we haven't told them that we're together, and they just assume we're friends.

The thing is, my boyfriend doesn't seem to understand the severity of his parents' behavior. To him, they're just ""good people who are trying their best"". Every time I bring up the fact that they do horrible, horrible things to him and they're one of the main reasons he's carrying a LOT of trauma today, he just sort of brushes it off and starts bringing up the good things that they've done for him. Things like ""Well, my mom brought me breakfast while I was in bed today"" or ""My parents have been letting me leave the house a little bit more"". When his dad tailed us while we were getting food, my boyfriend's reasoning to me was ""Well, he left when we sat down to eat! He wasn't technically following us the whole time, so I don't know why you're upset."" His loyalty to his parents is continually ripping our relationship further and further apart, and wearing my patience very thin. There's a new incident every day. And this wouldn't be as much of an issue if my boyfriend admitted that they're abusive and that their behavior is wrong. But he won't. He keeps excusing their actions and trying to convince me that I'm being too harsh. And there's a LOT of other incidents and abusive behavior examples that I haven't listed here.

I also want to clarify that I've been nothing but kind to his parents. Despite the fact that I don't like them, I'm always extremely polite to them when I see them. I try to make a good impression, I bring gifts when I'm invited over to their house (we're both middle eastern families, it's a pretty normal tradition to bring stuff), I always make sure to greet them and have good manners. I haven't done anything that might displease them, so the only reason they have to dislike me is my gender identity and sexual orientation.

At this point, I can't in the right mind continue a relationship with him when his parents continue to prove to me that they're disgusting and manipulative. They get in the way of me and my boyfriend having an even REMOTELY normal relationship. I'm sick of him excusing his parents' blatant bigotry and abuse. I've made it very clear that if things continue to go the way that they have been going, I'm going to put down an ultimatum on the table.

It's either me, or his parents. He can't have both.

I haven't given him this ultimatum yet, but I *have* told him that it might get to that point. Believe me, I don't want it to get there. I love him and I'm happy that we're together. But I want to put my own dignity and my own mental health first, and I can't do that if him and his parents are a ""package deal"" of sorts.

I feel like a lot of these problems will fade away once we move in together (we have plans of doing so in the future when we're more financially stable and have saved up enough since renting an apartment where we live is generally very expensive), but it's going to be MISERABLE until that eventually happens.

Is it fair for me to give him an ultimatum like this? What else can I possibly do to try and have a normal, functioning relationship? Should I just grin and bear it?

So to start off, I have experienced a lot of things that really show people's theory of mind. I have autism and bipolar disorder and have struggled with mental health since I was a child. I also probably have OCD but haven't been diagnosed with it formally. I'm quite the smart guy, but my mental illness really interferes with my daily life. I often lack the energy to do things because my mind always feels at war with itself. I often find people don't understand me like for example when I was in high school people thought I was weird and used me as the butt of a joke. Also people like my stepfather often thought that my mental illness was self inflicted since he never suffered from that kind of thing. I feel like the only thing that empathizes with me is my music that I listen to. I'm a metalhead.  


It's not just this that bothers me, it's a lot of environmental things too. My mom died of terminal brain cancer when she was only in her mid 40s and I miss her a lot. And then my dad became very depressed after and committed suicide. He was the person who I loved most in my life. A man who I know for sure if he was still alive he would be someone I would be very close too. Then I was taken in by my aunt and when I was misbehaving she gave me away and doesn't talk to me anymore. This for me really tells me what for a lot of people family doesn't matter. Even when I don't do the things I did that were wrong anymore, she still wants nothing to do with me, my siblings or my mother's side of the family.  


Also I'm quite the caring person and it hurts me to see how much people want to use you. I live with a roommate and he tried to seem like my friend and still does. But I really dislike him now because behind my back he has been stealing money from me and I want to have him charged. I don't get how someone could do that to their fellow human being. Even if someone is in disagreement with my values and beliefs, I still will be nice to them as my fellow human brother or sister. This person in question is such a hypocrite because he claims to be a christian but he has violated the commandments by stealing from me and coveting my property. As an atheist, this proves to me that religion doesn't make you a better person.  


I just hate how self centered people are in this world. I wish we could live in a society where we all can get what we need and want for our well being and we don't have to worry about others doing such vile things. I now want to dedicate my life to being a good person and want to be that person who gives out good vibes, but right now I feel so depressed.  


But even when this all happened, I'm still grateful for my true friends. My brother, sister and my buddy. They are good people. I love to surround myself with good people, but my brother and sister live far away and I don't see my friend due to covid. Stuff's tough right now.

Okay so this may not be a very big deal but I would like someone elses opinion on it. 
So, me (F19) and my boyfriend (M19) who I'll call A, have been together for a little more than a year. We met in school and there we hade a friendgroup consisting of 2 more girls. Now, them and A had known each other a little but before this, while I knew no-one when I started in this school. So, almost at the end of the last year, me and A got together and I explained to him that I did feel left out by these 2 girls, even if I Consider them my friends (or did) I got the feeling that i had To invite myself and that It wasnt really anyone who though that ""of course i should join them!""
So, 2 days ago it was planned that we together with 1 more would meet up at one of these girls house, Maybe eat dinner and hang out, outside because of the current situation.
Well, It was almost at that time and I send a text to my boyfriend, asking when he was going to be there. He and the 2 girls had apperantly planned when and where to meet up earlier and buy dinner to take with them. And No, I was not ""invited"" to these plans, so I stayed home a bit longer to eat dinner with my parents instead. Well the time went and no one sent any message or whatever to confirm when we would be there, yada yada. I already felt a bit left out, so I didnt really want to go anyway and didn't show up. What makes me feel even worse about it is that No-one asked why I want there, where I was and alike, Not even my boyfriend. 

Now, what might have a reason to this is that I about a week before that, told A that I wasnt really feeling for this meet up, and as he know that I dont really like one of these girls. But I tried to figure out when he would be there to come at the same time, if he would eat there and the fact that they had planned everything on the side without inviting me just made me loose any feeling to want to go there.

If you guess who I’m talking about please keep it to yourself.

There’s a recordist/youtuber who does great recording/mixing tutorials that i respect because his content is practical, universally applicable (no specific gear or plug-ins), effective, accessible. His free vids alone have taught me quite a lot. He’s also very responsive (usually) to comments, emails, questions- and just strikes me as a really good person. Helpful and welcoming, not at all condescending or gatekeepery.

I’ve wanted to support his channel and business for a long time, but as a broke musician just beginning to learn engineering it’s very hard picking a particular lesson to drop coin on.

Then last year he offered an incredible deal. ‘All of my courses for __, plus access to ALL future courses’, basically Lifetime Access. This was a savings so compelling i borrowed against the job i was on to purchase the package. I wasn’t disappointed. His site is a trove of practical applications of concepts that had eluded me. I devoured his work and improved because of it.

But when it comes to those new courses, there’s a problem. 

There were no terms on access period, or when new courses might not be free. It was a very simple deal- ‘This much money for access to all of my courses past and future’. 

Was this a good deal for him to offer? Likely not. Does it sound like a deal offered in desperate need of some upfront cash to keep a business afloat? Kind of. Do i want this dude’s business to remain afloat? Very much. So cash goes down, paid gladly because we both seem eager for what the other’s offering. Good thing, he IS still afloat for the time being.

After purchase the next time he advertised a new course, it didn’t show up in mine. After 2 weeks i emailed him and got a ‘oops, forgot to add that!’ response that was very amiable and professional, the course went up. I was so pleased with our interactions.

The next course he added didn’t show, i emailed, no response, but it went up. Also a great course. 

Since then he’s dropped 2 or 3 more, they never showed up in my dashboard. I emailed about it after the first no-show. No response. I asked in comments on his youtube vids, no response. Facebook instagram twitter, nope, no, nada. Ditto the next 2 courses.

I’m loathe to hit him up further because i really don’t want to sour this guy on communication with me in case i have questions. 

Also we live in the same region and it’s not inconceivable that we could find ourselves in a client/collegial relationship in the future. 

Also it seems like a dick move at a busy time of year to go on his social media and be like WHY DON’T YOU HONOR THE TERMS OF YOUR DEAL in front of everybody.

Also, he’s a REALLY NICE GUY and i want to give him the benefit of the doubt, and just not be a hassle. 

But i paid good money for his course bundle. And maybe I’m just oldfashioned but when i make a deal i expect its terms to be honored.

#Skip rant about cat bites below

Cats use their claws to scratch posts which helps calm them down. Removing a cats claws changes the way they have to walk which results in serious joint pain that only gets worse with age. Lastly, cutting a cats claws off just makes them do something worse. BITE. When you take a cats claws away they can no longer scratch and resort to biting instead. They bite harder than they claw, and a cat bite can cause serious infection. On average 1 out of 3 cat bite victims get HOSPITALIZED as a result of infection. There was a study done in cat bites with 57 people. All 57 people were bitten by a cat and 38 ended up needing surgery to fight the infection.

You’re clipping their ears off over your OWN COSMETIC INTERESTS.

It’s even worse with dogs because they don’t even understand. Even doing it at a young age, it has been shown that they DO feel their ears being clipped when babies. Same thing for docking tails. You should never dock your dogs goddamn tail that’s ridiculous. The ONLY time you should be allowed to dock your fucking animal’s tail is when it is medically necessary (Previous injury or risk of infection.)

1. Neither McDonalds, Chic-fil-a, Burger King, nor Taco Bell have Coke's machine that lets us choose from their hundreds of drink choices while going through the drive through. I am not sure if that is a national thing, but it is at all the ones in my area. 
2. They have just as good of a selection as the other major chains. They are all about equal when it comes to the quality of their meats, cheeses, breads, and biscuits. 
3. What separates them from the rest is that they have THE BEST fries in the morning. They are comparable to KFC and Bojangles's fries, but they are smaller, crispier, better seasoned and just overall better. 
4. They are not well known for their breakfast, so the lines are very short.

However, my new supervisor is almost worse than the people I was working with before and I'm already on his bad side. My new role has me as basically a gopher. Going from one job site to another, picking and dropping off supplies, stopping at vendors to purchase things we need, etc. For the most part, I like it. I get to drive around by myself, listen to music I like, and for the most part it is low stress.

However, one of the things I hate is how my boss wants me to interact with some of our vendors. My boss is a ""never pay full price"" kind of person and it really rubs me the wrong way. Whenever he sends me somewhere to buy something, he always tells me to ask for ""at least 10% off."" He justifies it by saying we give these places a lot of business and spend a lot of money there. My problem is that this makes me incredibly uncomfortable as I feel I am putting the person doing the transaction in a tough spot to either make the decision on their own, or call a manager and then I have to talk to them. I've tried having them call my boss, but he got upset with me and told me I should be handling that on my own. 

So my  solution to this has been to just not ask anymore. When my boss asks about it I tell him that they told me they can't do that anymore and that if he wants to talk to them about it, he needs to do it himself. He got mad at me about it and I told him that it's not like I can force them to give us a discount, they said ""no,"" what else do you want me to do?

Apparently my boss has been griping about it to some of the job site managers and one of my friends overheard and told me about it. My boss said he is losing money since I've taken on this role and might need to make a change. I don't think he would outright fire me, but I suppose it's possible as a worst-case thing. But I also don't want to lose this position as it's far better than what I was previously doing. 

I also don't have a high school diploma and this company is helping pay for me to get my GED, so I can't just up and leave to find a new job right now.

Also rambling, but again hurt feelings and such.

I’m not sure where to start so back story first. Beginning of December he was having an issue with his tooth, it was hurting and infected. He went to the dentist who prescribed him an antibiotic and a temporary seal I guess for the pain. Then was told to go see a specialist this month for a root canal. Well, the pan goes away and he ignored the last part, decided he didn’t need to make an appointment and goes on with his life. Friday he knocks the temporary seal off and the pain starts to come back slowly. This morning I made an appointment for him, with the specialist, but they can’t see him until Friday. 

I have never had a problem with my teeth, but I hear it is quite miserable, so I leave him to himself today. I take the baby to my moms and everything seems to be ok. I sent a text to let him know that I was bringing home supper and was leaving in an hour. On my way home I called and asked, if he would help me bring in the baby, food, diaper bag, etc. (like everyday) 

Fast forward to the end of the night, I am getting out of the shower and he starts moaning about his tooth. I offer a solution, but that’s not good enough for him because, “Do you know if it’s infected or no?” (I don’t, that’s why I suggested calling the regular dentist to see if you could get an emergency antibiotic. Knowing they will not be able to do the procedure with an active infection) At this point I could see where this is going and I said, “Fine. Whatever. Good night, I’m going to sleep.” 
Well, that wasn’t good enough for him either, I could tell he already decided he wanted a fight. 
He starts screaming about how I woke him up (sorry, I didn’t know you were sleeping) and how the next time he come home from night shift he is going to make sure to wake me up. 
I just wanted to go to bed and I’m sure this lashing out is because of the tooth pain, but I don’t deserve to be yelled at. This all started over me expressing a genuine concern. He wanted to be mad and yell, I tell him if he wakes the baby that he can take care of him. That make things worse. F you’d are now being exchanged. At this point I say “Happy Anniversary” and leave the room.

Now I’m in the baby’s room crying and typing my feelings out to strangers because I don’t know what to do. Tomorrow he will come at me with the “I’m sorry” “I’m so happy to have you” but I’m hurt and mad. 

So Reddit, take the baby and get out of the house for the day, spend our anniversary giving him the silent treatment. Or act like nothing is wrong and see what happens?

When she got off the bus, she asked if she could do her homework at SAC instead and not after school. SAC is like a problem where the school watches your children for you when you are at work. However, there have been some problems with that due to the school not opening their doors to let SAC kids in when it is time to drop them off. They said that we could drop her off as early as 6:00 am, but there have been some complications and it’s been interfering with work/school. 

I told her no, that she would have to do her homework after school like she always has. I gave her the reasons, but she couldn’t to argue with me. I asked her to clarify what she was talking about because at that moment I wasn’t understanding. She was disagreeing with me, but also agreeing with me and that made me confuse over all. She was starting to roll her eyes, slam doors, cut me off when I spoke, raising her voice at me, pouting, and saying that I had no clue what I was talking about.

I told her that she is acting disrespectful and to please stop. I told her if she continued to act like this, I would be taking her phone. She continued to behave like that and I asked to see her phone. She was refusing, but she eventually gave it to me. I told her that she could be upset all she wants, but she cannot be rude to people when they tell her no. I was going to give her phone back to her after she completed her homework, which would be less than thirty minutes. I’ve taken away her phone before when she’s been rude or refusing to do chores/homework under my watch. Her father (M36) knows this and never told me to stop. 

She then lost her mind. She actually lost her mind. She slammed her door after I took her phone in my room and screamed on top of her lungs. She started throwing things in her room, took all the covers/pillows off her bed, broke her desk supplies, kicked/punched things. She was saying things like, “She [me] can’t have my phone forever!” and how much she despised me. How I’m a horrible sister and that she wished I was never a part of her life. 

I let her throw her tantrum because she needed to cool off, even though it was absolutely not an okay thing to do when you’re upset. I eventually hear her stop screaming and thought that maybe she’s calmed down now, but nope. She ran outside without telling me and I had to go look for her. I told her that she can’t run outside without telling me where she’s going, and refused to respond. I went back inside to give her some space that she needs and the dogs were barking from the inside. 

Once I settled down the dogs’ barking, I turned around and she was gone outside. I went out there again and I eventually found her somewhere else.

I told my mom and her dad about this. He called my sister during his break to see what was going on and my mom was angrily messaging me. She was telling me that what I did was absolutely not okay and that she was refusing to come home if I was upset. I was really confuse because I was just worried, since my sister ran out of the house without telling me where she was going.

I’ve only raised my voice at my sister two times: when she threw her school’s Chromebook in a raging fit when I told her no and when she refused to go to school in the morning, where there would be no way for her to get another source of transportation if she missed the bus. So, I definitely was not as upset as my mom was thinking. 

I thought I handled the situation pretty well. I didn’t raise my voice, I gave her a warning of the consequences if she continued her behavior, etc. 

My mom said that her husband, my sister’s father, would be having a talk to me when he gets home and that is never good. Just to give an example, he tried to make my mom choose him or me in an angry fit. Made fun of my past trauma/abuse, told me I was disrespectful for having differing opinions then him, and made me cry. Over what, exactly? When he asked me why I was upset and he didn’t like the answer to it. That’s it. That’s literally it. I kid you not, there were guests in the house at the time and they didn’t do a thing, but came to me afterwards to help me because they agreed that he was 100% in the wrong about this. I’m definitely not ready to have a conversation with him.

At this point, I’m assuming the worse and I don’t know how to cope with that. The only thing I could think of doing wrong was taking away her phone, even though it was less than thirty minutes. I was raised differently and would literally get sent to live at another house if I acted out like she did, with the eye rolling and slamming doors. I think I’m definitely bias and expect too much from her when it comes to not acting like that.

Also starts trying to say he can't confirm if his dad was a Nazi, just that he fought for Germany as if they're different things.

He was always great with her.

For the past year, he acts different. So does she, of course, but she's 18 now. I can't tell if he's just trying to be ""cool"" and fit in with her, or if he's being creepy (and even thinking that makes me feel guilty).

He makes sex jokes when she's with us, whereas before he never did that (ex: jokes about vibrators or a sex position...definitely just jokes, nothing terribly offensive, but it still shocks me a bit to hear it because he never acted like that in front of her before). He's always told these types of jokes, but definitely never in front of the kids.

He also texts her here and there (about normal, logistical things). I was with her and he texted her a joke meme so she showed me. She wasn't grossed out or anything...just kind of confused (""lol why is he sending this to me?""). And there was nothing wrong with it, but it was a silly joke showing a woman in very skimpy clothes. It was only moderately funny and something I'd expect him to send his buddies. I asked him why he sent that and he said he thought she'd find it funny, and he was sorry if it offended her (it didn't...she just seemed confused and kind of laughed and moved on with whatever she was doing).

I asked him why he makes jokes like that and he said it's because she's growing up and now can hear ""adult jokes"" and he thinks it's just harmless and funny. And he thinks she likes that he's treating her as more of an adult now. I told him I don't like it and he said I act too uptight and prudish about these things. But even after I've spoken to him about it, he still slips up.

She's never expressed liking or disliking anything. This is all me. It makes me feel weird and uneasy. I know he watches porn with young women in it, and for some reason now that my daughter is 18, the whole thing just icks me out.

So if there are any step-fathers of teenaged daughters on here, please tell me....am I being irrational? Am I just uneasy having my daughter hear sexual jokes? Am I just finding it hard to accept she's mature enough now and I don't have to shelter her anymore? Or is he being obnoxious? (again, she's never mentioned anything either way, and half the time she doesn't seem to hear/""get"" what he said, and if she did she will laugh). She doesn't seem uncomfortable; it's definitely me who is uncomfortable, and now that I'm ""on edge"" I seem to notice him making these jokes a lot.

We took her to a foster home that was a big farm and they took us out to look at the dogs. I squatted to pet the dog that my daughter really wanted (we’ve been looking for a few months and my daughter was convinced that this was *the one*) and a few others got excited and ran over to say hi.

My ex started freaking out and saying that because the dog my daughter loved was one of the ones that was jumping all over me, she wasn’t safe for our daughter. He was saying that the dog was aggressive and dangerous, which just wasn’t true at all. Also, our daughter is 16, not 3. A dog jumping on her in excitement is not dangerous. My daughter was devastated that her dad wouldn’t let her get the dog she loved. 

I tried to convince my ex that the dog was perfectly safe but he wouldn’t listen, so I told my daughter that I would get her the dog and the dog could live with me full time. My daughter decided that she would just visit her dad during the day from now on so she could spend every night with the dog.

I feel like I'm using my femininity as a comfort zone that I need to break out of because that's not who I actually am. I love feeling feminine, but I also love feeling masculine and I love feeling androgynous. 

When I was like 12 I (afab) tried to use a wide belt as a binder cos I wanted to feel like a boy in front of the mirror. I've always wanted to be a drag king and have had my name picked out for years. I want to be Kit (short for Katya (similar to my birthname cos I don't want to say it)/Chris (if I were a boy). Basically depending on how I'm presenting. Kit would be perfect. It's neutral and it's even been a childhood nickname from childhood friends, but no-one I know now calls me that anymore.

I've told my fiance (24M) that I've felt very confused about my gender lately, and he's been fairly open-minded about it so far. But he was also the kind of guy to make transphobic jokes, and made a few homophobic jokes even after I came out as bi.

But when I told him, his main concern was that I wouldn't change myself physically. I do understand that, like I know he fell in love with me as a female, not me as anyone else. He's physically attracted to me, and he's made it very clear he's 100% straight (which is obviously okay). One of the first things I told him was that I didn't want to take hormones or have surgery, but he absolutely refuses to use any pronouns for me other than ""she"", and (this is gonna sound stupid but idk how else to phrase it) I don't vibe with ""she"" that much. I'm fine with being ""she"", but he always tries to ignore the ""they"" and ""he"" in me. I prefer they/she. I think I like ""they"" more, but ""she"" is acceptable, I guess. Like, I won't throw a fit about it, but it just doesn't really feel right if that makes sense??

He even told me that he'd be put off if I ever identified as a boy, even if it was just a feeling rather than me physically presenting as a boy. I have always wanted to buy a binder and he was really off-put by the idea. He said he's happy for me to do what I want, but wouldn't elaborate despite being very clearly uncomfortable. I've been with him for 5+ years, I know when he's uncomfortable.

Honestly, I don't even know how to feel or what to do. I live away from my parents now, so I finally have the opportunity to experiment with my gender. But I know my fiance won't be comfortable if I do. He's straight, so he won't be attracted to me if I present as non-binary (which is what I think I am???) or male (which I like being sometimes).

I don't know if I should just be as femme as possible for him or be who I am and risk him losing attraction to me. I don't want to lose him.

For instance, in some areas, there are a few places that it’s common knowledge is gang territory. If the police know that a gang operated and deals in illicit activities in specific places, how does that gang even exist? Why doesn’t the police do something about it?

Some people are known gang leaders/members. Why don’t the police just arrest known gang members? Or at least ask them for Information? I understand that this DOES happen very often, I’m just not sure why it isn’t more common. Another example is motorcycle gangs. If law enforcement knows that a biker gang is dealing drugs/committing crimes, how come they can just openly wear patches and brag about being the 1%?

I understand that the police can’t do anything until a crime is actually committed, but wouldn’t wearing crime related clothing encourage the police to investigate certain groups, hence leading to mass arrests?

It’s kind of hard to explain what I’m asking, but I think most people will understand my question.

We’ve been together for four years and have lived together since the spring. I’m a major New Years resolution person and goal setter. And most of the time, I achieve my goals. I have a system and I stick to it. It’s worked for years. I check in with my goals and resolutions almost every day of the year. My boyfriend is a go-getter and good at setting and achieving his goals but he does get distracted and can over complicate things.
Yesterday, he asked me to show him how I set my yearly goals. As I was explaining he interrupted to tell me that what I’m doing is wrong??? And not long term enough? That was frustrating to begin with, because WHY does he need to control my personal goal of knitting or how fast I want to run? So we decided to set 5 year goals. That’s fine. We decided to sit down today to work on it. Please note, that for my B of A every class involved setting SMART goals so I am practiced in doing this on a personal and professional/academic level. I am no rookie.

So we sit down and he’s says “what’s your fitness goal” and I explain I want to get in better shape but that is too vague so I’m saying I want to fit back into an old dress, decrease my resting heart rate to below 70, and run a 5km in under 35 mins. And that’s just some of the ways how I can objectively measure if I’ve achieved my goal BUT I have to write how I will achieve those goals and he just GOES OFF about how those aren’t real goals and is getting so worked up and upset about how we need to be specific and he’s like “what do you mean get in better shape?? What does it mean you want to lower your heart rate?” And he starts writing down our daily schedule as a pie chart and explaining our hours as percentages. I said that isn’t how I envision my goals and tried AGAIN to explain I write yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily goals so I can adapt as I need and break down my time in ways that are productive FOR ME, and that he needs to get a journal or agenda to do the same. He goes on and on about how we need to be specific like DUDE I FUCKING KNOW. Why do you think I do break down a yearly goal into DAYS???? I say I’m thinking of working out 6 days a week and planning out my workouts on Sunday and then adapting each day and blah blah blah. Still not good enough for him. He kept saying “what does that MEAN” It was getting NO WHERE so I finally said let’s take time to write down our goals the way we feel is appropriate and how it would look in our lives and then compare and he’s like no because they’ll look different. DUDE THEY ARE DIFFERENT - THAT IS THE POINT. Maybe if we can write it down we can see that the goals are the same but we just communicate them differently. I finally convince him we can just do one goal and see if it works then if not we can go back to this endless stupid arguing (didn’t say it like that lol). 

I write mine out, including how my daily check ins with myself work and he comes back and has literally just written out his daily schedule and pointed out all of the reasons he doesn’t have enough time to do his goals and how hard it will be and how he needs to be so specific to reach his goals. IF YOU NEED TO BE SPECIFIC WRITE IT DOWN LIKE I’VE ASKED YOU TO FOR THE LAST TWO DAYS. Then he has the audacity to say that I seem defeated and hopeless. YES. Because my boyfriend is going on about all the ways our goals are pointless and will fail!!! I finally get him to see he is being defeatist and we talk about how much he hates his job and how little he makes for the amount of work he does and I kind of knew the whole time that was what was bothering him but MY GOD. He kept saying how my personal methods don’t  work and how he knows that no method works and it’s all just about motivation???? NO IT IS NOT. You haven’t even TRIED my method and he takes off to research goal setting and GUESS WHAT METHOD COMES UP??? MINE. And he’s like okay our fitness goals will never align so let’s move on. Fine! 

He says he wants to work on “house goals” next. I have no idea what that means so I ask him for an example and he insists I go first. I suggest taking ten minutes to clean and tidy the house every night and he FREAKS OUT. “No!!! That isn’t what I want! Like I want to reduce our trash!” THEN WHY THE FUCK DIDNT YOU SAY THAT?? WHY INSIST I GO FIRST???? So I just ask him as calmly as I can how we can measure that, and I suggest we set a goal of only taking the trash out twice a month and everything else is recycle, reuse, compost and reduce and he’s like “no!!!!! It doesn’t work like that!” HOW THE FUCK DOES IT WORK THEN????? And then he goes on about how he’ll figure it out himself so I’m like okay fine, next goal. He says he wants us to use the chore chart I made 6 months ago but he kept putting off using but then flips out about how the chores are “too long”. They’re too long because you don’t do them weekly!!! Of course it takes longer to mop if you only mop once a month!!

So I finally figure out a system of chores that makes sense for him and he’s okay why are we doing this? And I say we do it to for our mental health! Keep things clean for our mental health! And he’s like okay why? And jokingly I say “so we don’t kill ourselves” and he’s like “okay we need to figure out why we don’t want to kill ourselves then” DUDE WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. He keeps insisting we need to keep asking “the why” so I finally just say because we want to be happy and be productive to accomplish our long term goals. So he’s happy with that and is like let’s move onto our food goals. We write a few down and he’s like “okay how do we accomplish these?? How do we know if we have accomplished these??” And I AGAIN explain the food diary and the habit tracking I do, and the weekly goals and daily menus and stuff that I have done in the past and he FLIPS OUT AGAIN. Saying that we can’t just do that and we need to set a day that we plan our food out and this plan doesn’t mean it’ll get done like????? I HAVE NO IDEA how to help him understand that he needs to keep a calendar and journal for all of this and that. I tell him that if he wants to do it a specific way he needs to say that instead of ripping on the way I do it. He just sighs and throws his pen down and at this point I burst into tears and am screeching saying I’m trying and you shoot down all of my ideas and my methods and if you think you know better then you write it down! And that I’m trying to help him and he asked me for help but every answer or idea I give him isn’t good enough. And he’s like “you know what, I’m done. I’m leaving.” He admits he’s isn’t being fair to me, and that he knows he’s difficult and acting like his boss who he despises. So now he’s off somewhere and I’m sitting alone at home working on my own goals and resolutions and how I want will accomplish them and I just feel like I spent three hours talking to a crazy person. 

He isn’t normally like this, and I know he’s freaking out because he turns 30 soon and he feels like a failure in life because he hates his job and he’s in debt from being in a professional school but CHRIST.

So decided to shoot my shot first in the conventional way by asking her out. She declined. Then after a few months we were having an afterparty for the end of the school year and we were both drunk, so we made out.

I cant be apart of a movement that demonizes homosexuals for being same sex attracted, Saying I'm exclusively attracted to biological men invokes a wave of ""You're a transphobe"" ""Gential preference haver"" ""Bigot"" ""Examine your sexuality"" 

""Examine my sexuality?"" the last group of people who said that to me were homophobic right wing Christains, whom sent me to pray away the gay camp to examine my sexuality.

On dating apps I've gotten death threats for turning down Transmen, These transcels behaviour is is wide spread many homosexual females my sister included have been told its transphobic to deny a transwoman because she has a penis/is a biological male and have gotten death threats also.

On pronouns, I have no problem using she/her him/he if you look unambiguously male/female I will probably default to that, this isnt transphobia/misgendering its a subconscious choice based on how you look.

This decision has mostly been made by me. My husband supports my decision but is worried about being cut out of the family for making this decision. Cast here is Me, DH (husband), SIL1 (his oldest sister about 30) SIL2(his middle sister about 27), MIL and FIL.

&amp;#x200B;

For some background, DH and I are in our mid to late 20's. We have been married almost 3 years and together for almost 4. We moved pretty quickly in our relationship and so we moved in and got engaged within 6 months. We planned a wedding a year from then but due to drama and threatening from his family, we eloped without telling anyone. Words were said to us from his immediate family, and they began a smear campaign about me online and said some incredibly mean, hurtful things, that they HAVE NOT apologized for. It was everything from comments about my weight, to calling me a whore, to saying I control my husband and am trying to remove him from the family. MIL and FIL (after we got engaged) invited us to their house after we got engaged and it turned into a screaming session where they were mad we didn't come to them first before getting engaged, told us we didn't even know each other, we had no money to get married, and lastly, that their son must have accidentally knocked me up and was just trying to do the right thing.. They made my husband cry and we distanced ourselves after that. SIL1 and SIL2 also messaged us nasty things and called me horrible things. I can only imagine what they actually said about us when they got together (which they often do).

&amp;#x200B;

We have an okay (touchy) relationship with my in-laws now, which is helped because we moved a thousand miles away after they wouldn't stop coming to our apartment and banging on the door screaming at us to open up so we could ""talk"". Now is a good time to mention that FIL is a raging alcoholic, MIL is a closet alcoholic, and SIL2 is definitely a lush, but she thinks that she's classy about it because she has more money than her family...

&amp;#x200B;

SIL2 has been dating this guy for about 3 years. MIL and FIL absolutely love him and their relationship. (SIL2 was always the golden child and I have seen evidence of this). Well they got engaged a couple months ago and MIL and FIL were SO excited that they called US before SIL2 could even call us. It brought back literal flashbacks to being verbally attacked by them and I got sick. SIL2 says she's sending us a save the date. This wedding is next Winter, a thousand miles from where we currently live. MIL and FIL are helping in any way they can financially, which sort of hurts when I think of our engagement.

Edited to say. Dh doesn't want to go but is worried that  he will be cut out from the family and won't be able to see his dad. But none of them have ever truly apologized for what they did to us.

Hi,

Me, male, 29, have had 2 short relationships in the last year. I have been relatively happily single all the time but I was open to find a new, lasting relationship. I had been on many dates, but started seeing exclusively 2 girls (each at separate time).

Girls fell in love with me but I just couldn't get emotionally invested in either of them. They were both stable good looking females, but there just wasn't the click from my side. I tried to figure it out and hope they switch in chemistry will come from my side, but it didnt. In the end it was only fair to both of them for me to stop seeing them since I haven't really felt much.

I am starting to question this Tinder dating since it gives the whole idea of dating casually and doesn't really require building an emotional connection before meeting a person. Maybe we, guys see it from an easy sex point of view and the whole idea makes the dating screwed.

Does anyone have a similar story to share? I feel like I am throwing away relationship with good women who have a potential for a long term relationship, but I am not feeling the spark. I know I shouldn't be too hard on myself too. It just sucks.

She takes a chance and opened her heart, allowing herself to be vulnerable. She meets him for dinner. He travels for work, and they speak via text, phone and video chat daily. They spend every moment together when he’s not working. She takes time off from her job or works around her daily schedule to see him when he’s home (about every 2 weeks). He gives her a key to his apartment, he asks her to marry him...she says yes. She helps him start his divorce process. 

RELATIONSHIP: 1 1/2 years together. During that time, she paid some bills for the apartment (because it was “their” place - still only his name on the lease). When he’s come home from work, she drove to pick him up; she drove him here &amp; there to run errands (pay bills buy groceries etc.) This is her way of showing him she cares about him &amp; their relationship. 

ISSUE: She senses there is a greater power wedging them apart. She continues to show her love, kindness, affection. They encounter different relationship tests during their time together &amp; she always seems to get them through it. She is good at analyzing both sides of the issue, listening to both arguments and working through finding compromise. This seems to hold them together. Then one day after 1 1/2 years he sends a random text that says he feels she “changed” and that they are not on the same page anymore. Her reaction is simply telling him not to contact her, to walk away and go their separate ways. She doesn’t show her pain to anyone, she doesn’t shed a tear. She puts one foot in front of the other and moves forward. 

RECENTLY: A little over a year after they part ways, she receives a random message from him asking for forgiveness. Remember, she hid her pain, moved on with life and is working on her own goals (she went back to school). Her initial instinct is to block him again. (Yes, he found a way to contact her after she blocked all his contact sources). Then she decides to message him to let him know she moved on with life and fulfilling his request in the message won’t happen because their relationship is in the past, and the past can’t be changed. She lets him know she knew certain things during their relationship. She also lets him know her faults in the relationship. But now she finds herself constantly thinking about their relationship, and wondering if he will respond since he went out of his way to reach out...did he do this because he realized what he left behind or did he contact her again to have the last word?",0,0,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,self,To Forgive or Not (Should She?

At the beginning of the year, my cousin, ""N"" (48f) texted my sister ""S""(34f) and I 28(f) to ask us a favor. She hadn't seen her parents in over a year, cuz of the 'rona, as she lives out of state and her parents are both super high-risk, and she wanted to surprise them by flying in secretly and visiting for a few days. \*\*\*NOTE\*\*\* Before everyone gets uppity, cousin is a pediatrician, has already gotten both of her vaccines, and called her dad's cardiologist to get his blessing. Everyone was masked the entire time we were together.

Mine and S's roles were simple. I picked N up from the airport, drove her to the biggest city close to where aunt and uncle live, where we met S and she took her the rest of her way to my aunt and uncles house. We had all agreed from the start not to include or tell anyone else in the family what was going on, because my family is big, and loud, and no one can keep a secret to save their damn life. Well, before N had reached out to S and I, I guess she had initially texted another cousin ""C"" and another aunt ""A,"" as she wasn't sure if we would be able to get time off. They both declined, but suggested she reach out to us. We agreed on the spot.

Well, apparently A let it slip to my OTHER aunt ""B,"" who didn't know she wasn't supposed to know, and let it slip to my mother. At around the same time N texted me to let me know she'd landed, my sister and I got a text from our mom, saying, ""S, if I had known you were picking N up from the city, I would have just done it myself. Thanks for keeping me in the loop."" We tried to defend ourselves, and she just kept turning it into ""woe is me"" bullshit. N found out and sent her a long, detailed message about what had happened (I'm talking PAGES of text,) to which my mother replied ""Enjoy your time with your folks."" So now, my cousin feels awful. The surprise was still a success, but I'm still pissed that my mom put such a damper on what was supposed to be a sweet surprise. 

This all happened yesterday, and this morning my sister went to go pick up her dog from my parents house. Apparently she asked my mom if there was anything we could do to make her ""not mad"" anymore, and when my mother replied with ""nothing,"" she asked if they could at least have an adult conversation. Mom said she didn't want to, so my sister left, and apparently cried all the way home. We talked a bit this morning, and we've decided to just go NC for a bit, but I really want to text my mom and just rip her a new one for making my cousin and sister feel shitty. None of us did anything wrong, and it's bullshit that we all felt the need to defend ourselves anyway...

So, reddit, WIBTA if I did, should I just be the bigger person and move on?

ETA: Everyone who told me I suck was right, I totally get that now, except the dude who tried to make my sister out to be a pussy for crying? Long story short, if anyone cares: mom texted sister and I, completely making herself the victim. This is just the pettiest shit. Sister and I apologized, but also defended ourselves, and our mother wouldn't even acknowledge it. So, sister and I have decided to go No Contact with mom for a bit.

You want to go watch an original Hollywood blockbuster that isn't a sequel, prequel, remake, reboot, adaption, or part of this or that cinematic universe?  Like it's just an original story and some studio went all out on it with a big effects-driven blockbuster?  Good fucking luck.  It's gotten so bad that even whole *genres* have been monopolized by specific IPs.  When was the last time you saw a dinosaur movie that wasn't part of the Jurassic Park franchise?  Or a pirate movie that wasn't Pirates of the Caribbean?  Speaking of Pirates of the Caribbean, over at Disney's theme park division - home of the so-called ""Imagineers"" - they rarely if ever make rides based on original concepts anymore.  Now it seems like they can't get any concept approved by the suits unless it's ""\*Insert Popular Movie\* THE RIDE!""  I was just having a conversation over on the LEGO subreddit about how even that company - makers of the ultimate creativity toy - barely releases original genre lines like classic space or castle anymore, instead opting for LEGO Star Wars ™, LEGO Harry Potter ™, LEGO Super Mario ™, etc.  It used to be you could just go buy a generic sci-fi spaceship from one of their in-house lines, but now your only options are X-wings and TIE fighters for days.

I know *why* things have gotten like this, of course.  Corporations care about making money, not originality or creativity.  And they've concluded (and they're probably not wrong) that the general public is far more likely to turn up for a bad Star Wars movie than a really good original sci-fi movie purely based on name recognition.  So while I'll absolutely continue to blame them for prioritizing profit over artistic integrity, I also blame us, the general public, for encouraging them.

Now I realize this is getting really close to criticizing people for merely *liking* Star Wars or Marvel or whatever, but that's honestly not my intent.  I like those things too (even the allegedly bad ones), but I can't be the only one who's sick to death of EVERYTHING being based on some kind of existing IP these days, right?  I'm STARVED for new and interesting movies, theme park rides, and yes, even something as trivial as a fucking LEGO set that isn't based on a licensed property.  In fact part of the reason I love animation so much (everything from Pixar to web animation to Japanese anime) is it's one of the only places where original stories are still being made.  And I'm glad it is, because I really don't think it's good for society that a whole generation of children now is being raised to think this is normal, that something is somehow ""lesser"" if it isn't ""from"" some big corporatized licensed franchise.  At the risk of sounding completely cynical, if we don't make original stuff today, what will we reboot or remake or make an unnecessary sequel to twenty or thirty years from now?",0,0,unpopularopinion,t5_2tk0s,self,Everything being based on an IP these days is NOT a good thing,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/kowkdi/everything_being_based_on_an_ip_these_days_is_not/,all_ads,17.5

We have a dog that just lays around and rarely ever causes any trouble. A rule we had from our father was for one of us to leave our door open overnight for her.

During the time that we were alone, my brother was playing video games on his computer and I was out of the house for about an hour and a half. When I got home, I never left our dog alone. I also fed her and took her outside. I was home for 3 hours before I wanted to go to bed.

I wanted my brother to leave his door open. The main reason being that the upcoming morning was the only day in the week that I have to sleep in. I work around 30 hours a week on night shift (5PM-11PM on school nights, later on weekends). I have an obligation that I wake up around 8AM for on Saturday mornings and I have school during the week that I wake up at 7AM for, so Sunday is my only sleep in day. Moral of the story, I am very sleep deprived and desperately need a day to get a full night’s sleep.

When I went to my brother’s room and told him that I was going to bed and needed him to leave his door open for our dog, he refused and asked why it had to be him. His excuse was that he is going to be loud while playing video games, so his door should be closed. I told him that he’s loud even with his door closed and that this is the one night I actually get to sleep in during the week, so I will be keeping my door closed. He said that he absolutely refuses to keep his door open and shut it immediately when I walked away from his room and left it open. I knew that he wouldn’t leave his door open for the night after that, so I texted my father to update him that we were okay and told him what I did for our dog and that I asked him to leave his door open overnight when I went to bed to hopefully take most of the blame off of me when he comes back to both doors closed. I normally would let her sleep in my room in this situation with no problems whatsoever, but she barks when she hears that someone is home, my dad is loud in the mornings, and he gets home at 7-8AM. I wanted to minimize the amount of noise that could’ve potentially woken me up in the morning on the one day I can actually sleep in. In my eyes, the most my brother had to lose is the privacy of keeping his door closed overnight, since his sleep time was/is more flexible than mine and he’s able to sleep longer during the night while I would be losing my only night to get a full 8 hours of sleep.

A few semesters ago I saw a post about having ADHD that was very relatable which led me down a rabbit hole in which after researching it a little bit, I decided I might have it, but if I did it didn’t impact me very much and so I forgot about it for a while. 

Last semester it turned out it was pretty important. I was unable to focus for any period of time, I started having sensory issues in which I would need to spend hours in my room alone to calm down after stressful events (which were getting far more frequent), my moods also grew very unpredictable and I began to have fits of anger which I would direct at people if I didn’t immediately deal with the stress. 

This last semester has been very difficult for me of course. Not just because of COVID, but my dad has recently been diagnosed with a TBI that, since left untreated for so long, will likely kill him within 5 years. The stress eventually led up to me failing one of my more important math classes, at which point my parents took notice. 

I told my mom that I have been suspicious that I have ADHD for a while now, and I think with the added stress it has been making it very difficult for me to accomplish the tasks that I normally do in a semester. We looked it up a bit and my mom even called one of her friends who is a child specialist to ask for clarification about the symptoms. We ended the conversation with the general agreement that I would visit with the specialist friend in a week or so to see if it was adhd and how to handle it if it was. 

Well, fast forward a few week, my mom sat down with me with my dad this time. My dad explained that he didn’t want to get me tested because he was afraid that they would put me on medication that would be unappealing for job employers to see on my resume. He is convinced that the medication would get me addicted or alter my personality in some dramatic, permanent way. (I should mention at this point my mom is anti-vax although we have been vaccinated in order to attend our private school. I think she likely talked my dad into having this conversation with me) 

Anyways I expressed that I thought it would be counter productive to not even let me see the specialist, as I am failing my classes and have taken a huge toll on my mental health. Even if it is not adhd, there is clearly something going on and I need to handle it, which seeing the specialist could help with. 

Well, yesterday I went to talk with the national guard recruiter (my parents want me to join so they will pay for my college) and the recruiter asked me if I took adhd medication. It was not even a big thing, just a question, but my parents have taken it as proof that getting tested for adhd could ruin my future career. “You won’t be accepted if you take this medication! You’ll have to go into debt for college and won’t be able to land a high paying job to pay it off”. 

I think it’s bullshit and I am not going to be able to pass college anyways without taking some sort of action. 

Well, what do I do in this situation? Press to get tested? Ignore it?

But just let me vent for a second. 

I have general anxiety disorder, so while people worry about being late to work, or taking a test, I worry about things beyond my control and I perpetuate of what would happen, when nothing has. It is a horrible, HORRIBLE MENTAL ILLNESS!!! Not only that but when I go manic it lines up almost too perfectly to being Bi-Polar! What fun! I also have ADHA on board and I have over the years done things to make it lessen over time to the point that I rarely need medication. 

Tonight other than personal drama between boyfriend and his kids and his crazy soon to be ex wife, my mind was racing and while driving I thought. “Drive your car into the ditch! Nobody cares! Or you have sharp knife at home, go home, and use it.” All these thoughts racing, then it went back to the ditch, I thought what if it doesn’t work? Then you have no car to get to work when you realize this was a mistake? What if nobody finds your corpse? Will they be sad? 
As soon as I got home I called a friend but he didn’t answer. I called and left a text for my boyfriend all know because I am on a suicide watch list. (All it does is it sends the cops to your location, picks you up and drops you off at the local hospital, they hold you until 

1) somebody comes and picks you up. 

Or

2) you pass the 24 hold and they release you back out into the world. 

It’s a fucked up system, some people need a good night sleep like me and not think about how or why this is happening to me. Other just take the 24 hour hold and use it to wind down the clock until they go out and try again. Right now because of how I feel I know it will pass and I need sleep. I haven’t needed therapy or medication for years cause it a one off thing. Not every week kinda thing. 

But sometimes after that text you say to your friends of I need your help so I can go to a hospital or you to talk to me, talk me off that ledge, I don’t want it to be out of pity. Like “oh shit! let me get to you. Oh wait Nevermind you good? You cool? Ok next time call be before I go to bed so I can plan when you want to off yourself.” 

I remember one time I called a friend of mine who is a doctor, I told her, I wanted to jump in front of a train, she convinced me not to, but to meet her at the end of line for coffee. As soon I saw her I couldn’t stop crying. Mind you I was in the middle of a messy separation, but she was there.

Now I understand that I can’t help who she dates so I’ve kept my mouth shut and done my best to be supportive of her. He’s always around which I’ve accepted already and I never see her anymore (even though we’re roomies) but again I let that go. I’ve always been polite to him because I know what it’s like to have a boyfriend and best friend not get along and I don’t want to put her through all of that.

Last night the three of us were in the car and I was talking about some guy (I’m a single mom) and out of nowhere her boyfriend started ripping me into shreds calling me a hoe and even had the nerve to comment on my parenting. He accused me of bringing different men around my daughter which is NOT TRUE and when I asked him to elaborate on a time that I ever brought a guy around my daughter he just kept saying my life is a mess and how I need to get it together for my daughter??

I recently got out of an abusive relationship 6 months ago and haven’t been able to date but I met somebody who I POTENTIALLY would date so I got upset and of course started to defend myself.

He kept saying things that weren’t true and I wasn’t attacking him (even though he was verbally attacking me) I was just asking for clarification because the claims he was making were so untrue? 

I guess my problem is this, my friend didn’t say anything to him while he was berating me, tearing me to shreds in terms of my parenting and for wanting to date. 

She did nothing to defend me even though she KNOWS the hell I’ve personally gone through with that relationship and healing from it. 

Should I tell her I’m hurt that she let him talk to me that way? Even though he was being incredibly disrespectful I put an end to the berating just by saying “enough, I’m done with this conversation” when really I wanted to go off on him and tell him how I really felt about him personally. He was completely out of line but out of respect for my friend I dropped it. I’m hurt that she hasn’t even mentioned the situation to me or even apologized on his behalf because he said some really hurtful things. Do I even bring this up to her?

Also I’m worried because now I know how this guy feels about me, it’s going to drive a wedge in our friendship. Like obviously I don’t even get to see her anymore because he’s always around but she’s fallen so head over heels for this dude that I’m worried our friendship is going to end because of his clear disdain for me. What do I do?

***UPDATE***
So I had the conversation with my friend and she swears up and down that she doesn’t think ill of me. She also told me they talked in private about the situation. However today she sent me a long text message saying she can no longer help watch my daughter for me while I work two jobs and go to school because she goes to school and works two jobs and needs her weekends to relax. Before I moved out of state away from everyone I knew she TOLD me she would help me out no matter what (took me two years to finally move because I was unsure about moving to a new state where I know nobody). Up until her new bf she was fine with watching my daughter. We move into our new place tomorrow. I told her that I wish she would have had this conversation with me BEFORE we signed a 13m lease and then she flipped it on me.

They both don’t work but leave for 4+ hours everyday to eat and shop. Ive been working full time during winter break so my days off at this point are dedicated to cleaning the apartment because it’ll quickly get messy. If they do clean the apartment it’s only their dishes, but they leave it out for weeks until the drying rack gets full. One of them will clean like once every month, but only because their ADHD acts up so they’ll have spurts of cleaning in the middle of the night, but besides that they don’t really help much. 
One time I tried asking if they could help take out the garbage more or if they’d prefer having a schedule where everyone gets a turn to take it out because it was getting to the point where it was overfilled and no one would take it out. They basically told me “we do help around the apt, but since it seems to you that we aren’t then we’ll help more.” I apologized that it seemed that way and that I appreciate their extra hand around the apt. 
At this point we’re at the last week of winter break and they were gone for Christmas but came back January 1st. Since Christmas their dishes have been sitting there untouched and only being added. On top of this I’ve had to buy the toilet paper for everyone for two months now even thought I’ve tried asking them to buy the next one because we all agreed on the first move in day to rotate buying toilet paper. And finally they’ve never cleaned the bathroom. I’ve only seen one of them wipe down the sink every once in a while or wipe down the mirror, but nothing more.

I live with my younger sister. (18F, we'll call her YS) She, being very practical, decided to take this same spray bottle from the bathroom and use it in her own.

Cue the pungent chemical smell and suddenly stinging eyeballs. ""YS!!!"" I yell for her with tears in my eyes. I ask what was in the spray bottle. ""Bleach. I was cleaning."" she says cheerfully, then looks at me. ""Oh no....""

i´m not a native english speaker so please spare me.

I (39M) am married to my lovely wife (39F)for more than 5 years know and have been together for 10 Years now . We have 2 Children (8F,3F) have settled in our own house and most things are fine.

I work in a solid branch with good income that has allowed my wife to reduce her working time to 20 hours/week so she can take more care of our daughters and the house.

However since the birth of our first daughter she developed a lipedema wich just got serious in the last 2 years. Since she finds herself not attractive anymore our intimacy has declined over the years wich is also one of the problems why I´ve opened this post. That her physical appearance has declined over two pregnacys and 10 years doesn´t matter to met since i love her.

However over the last year with covid she also started to neglect the housekeeping. We have a system of shared work. I´ll do most of the physical hard work like gardening, technical things,cleaning the cat toilet, taking out the trash and so on. She just holds it up to a level where some friends or family could come over and to see certain rooms but not more. I do my best to compensate this and doing it myself but with a job that sometimes takes more than 50 hours a week this is not easy. Laundry will stay in the washing machine or dryer for weeks was something i got accustomed to but last week i´ve done the laundry finding shirts that i last wore 3 months ago.

She also gets verbaly very aggressive towards our daughters very easily sometimes saying nasty things that i would not think about ever saying to them. There is not a single day where there is no yelling when im home.

When she is not working ( Homeoffice currently) she visits her mother who lives in a house a hundred meters away(sometimes leaving the kids for some time there), sits in the living room checking social media tiktok etc or just watches TV for hours of the day.

Don´t get me wrong here im not a saint with doing all my work immidiately or in the best way possible. And i don´t need a place to live where its so tidy that i could eat from any surface. But if she would just invest 1-3 hours each day into the work that should be done than everything would be completely fine for me. Instead it´s not more than 2 hours a week.

I´ve already talked with her once just to get yelled at that she is ""stressed out"" and can´t handle all this. That she is always so physicly exhausted and so on. I also mentioned more than once to her to see a doctor to get a diagnose in the lipedema so we can arrange an operation. ( Here it is considered a plastic surgery and mostly you have to takeover the whole costs yourself) We are currently well off enough to afford this but she just keeps pushing it into the future and blocks all my attempts to get more involved. I also mentioned if she wants to see a therapist because i think she is somehow depressed but then just followed more yelling.

This is where i need some suggestions how i can make her get moving in this cases. I´m pretty sure it would help her a lot if she can get over her issues of her physical appearance. The weight loss wich would come with a surgery would also benefit her health since even before the first pregnancy she was not fit enough to sustain her current weight. I´m not thinking about anything to threat to leave her or something but i also don´t want to stick with it like it is because it starts to wear me down mentaly.",0,0,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,self,How to get my Wife to change.,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/kxwmvn/how_to_get_my_wife_to_change/,all_ads,7.0

I (26f) live with my partner (30m) for a little over a year now. We've been dating for 4 years. He's amazing - witty, funny, intelligent, handsome, and like just extremely confusing.

We started dating in 2017, we've always got along great. I will say that the issues we've had since day one are him pestering me, i/e calling me a bitch or making other jokes about my character, when I say he's being mean he says I am too sensitive, or i/e he will repeatedly poke or tickle me until I'm screaming stop. We've had one or two instances during sex that are similar, i/e I ask him to stop and he doesn't, there has been one time where I had to scream to get him to stop and another where I almost had to yell. As a result of this sort of ""pestering"" idk what to call it, I do flinch when he comes towards me, even if just for a kiss. I apologize for this often. I can't tell when he's coming up to me to lick my forehead or tickle me until I cry, or if he's just coming up for a kiss. I actually slapped him once because while we were kissing he started doing something weird like sucking my tongue. I know he was messing with me but it hurt and I couldn't tell him to stop, so I slapped him straight across his face.

That makes us sound awful, but that is the worst it got for us. Aside from that we are always laughing, always getting along, and we have each other's backs in tough times. I swear this is a relationship worth keeping, or else I wouldn't waste your time. 

In terms of the merciless tickling and the flinching bc I always think that's what he's doing, it really hurts his feelings when he feels like I don't want him to touch me. I told him that it's the physical teasing that has me on guard all the time, and he says he'll just stop touching me so much then, and I tell him don't worry about it because of course I still want him to hug me and hold my hand and stuff, and the cycle kinda continues from there. I will say he's better about the tickling, thank god because it left me with bruises that looked awful lol. 

My problems started about two weeks ago, when we were drinking. He was doing that same sort of thing, like messing with me I guess, but this time he put my arm in some wrestling move that hurt really bad and I started crying. He started to shush me and held his hand over my mouth to quiet me, which made me lose all of my shit. He was drunk and we were in bed. I couldn't stop crying. He went to sleep, I stayed up most of the night. The next day he said he didn't remember it? Which I thought was wild.

I think that event messed me up. I am a sensitive person. I was abused as a child. I am mostly fine but that feeling of powerlessness and feeling small really wrecked me. I started to notice more stuff, i/e him calling me a bitch a lot even thought he is just joking, i/e him telling his friends I'm perverted even though I don't think that's funny

We run a business together that's doing well, and on Saturday I had plans to finish some stuff that would get us ahead so that I could take off next weekend. On Saturday, he asked if I wanted to go with him to pick something up at the store. I asked if it would take long, he said it would take 15 minutes. So I went with him. It took 3 hours, of him running into various stores, while I sat in the car. I was way behind on my work now but didn't want to make a big deal out of it because he came out of each store in worse shape, saying things like ""I knew I was going to have a bad weekend"" and stuff like that after each time he came out of each store. So I was trying to comfort him, even though I kinda needed some comfort too at that point. I asked if we could stop for a coffee, he said sure. Then he was on his phone and didn't hear me when I said nevermind, because I forgot my wallet. So I gently tried to get his attention while he was driving over the speed limit and talking on his phone just to tell him we didn't need to stop and he screamed at me ""I GOT IT"". 

It hurt my feelings that he was being so snappy with me. I got really frustrated. When we got home I asked why he was so upset, he said he wasn't upset at all. I was confused. He explained that he was just snappy in the moment because he was on the phone. He wasn't upset. So I asked, you weren't upset the whole time? And he said no. I told him that he seemed extremely upset and was saying things that were super negative. He said he wasn't upset the whole time. 

Later that night out of the blue he asked me point blank if I thought he was abusive to me. I said no quickly but then I asked him why he would ask me that. He told me he could see that I felt crazy, and that abusers often make people they're abusing feel crazy. I told him I was just really confused about what happened. 

Come Sunday, he asked again if I wanted to go to the store with him, and I ended up not going because I was behind in my work and didn't trust that it wouldn't be a 3 hour ordeal that ended with me crying. He came home with two pieces of furniture to assemble. I was about to clean the house as I always do, but didn't want to be in his way, so I sat down on the couch while he did his thing. First, he asked for my help, and got really angry with me and snapped at me for not helping right I guess. Then, he was moving furniture to fit the new pieces and he was kind of scaring me: He was completely nonverbal at this point, he was slamming things and throwing things, and he seemed extremely angry, and he was screaming at the cat at the top of his lungs. My man is NOT like this. He never acts that way. I couldn't understand why he was being like this and honestly I wanted just one day of peace this weekend. So I stormed into the room and told him to please stop screaming at the cat, and that if he wants help he can just tell me, instead of slamming things and being mad. He looked at me like I had two heads, like I was on drugs, like I was the craziest motherfucker who ever motherfucked. He even put his hands in the air. Like I was going to shoot him or something. Again he insisted he was not upset at all and he made me feel so fucking crazy, he said something along the lines of ""I'll try to put the furniture down quieter next time so you don't get so sensitive"". 

I felt so crazy. Had I really just imagined it all? Did he come home acting normal and I just had this outburst out of nowhere? I was even more confused now. I went into the other room to be alone. I could hear him still throwing things in the living room, slamming shit and slamming doors. It turns out he got mad at the shoe closet and threw a shoe stand out into the yard?! Which is an angry thing to do in my too-sensitive opinion. 

He came into the room I was in and asked if I was ok. I told him no, I was really ashamed of myself for acting the way I did and I was really sad and lonely. He said ok. I went into another room because I knew I was going to cry and didn't want him to say I was being too sensitive again. I guess he got sick of me crying because after like 30 minutes he came in to tell me to get up. I said I was too overwhelmed and sad and didn't want to. He insisted and also BLEW AIR DIRECTLY INTO MY EAR CANAL (which hurt) until I got up. Then he encouraged me to lay back down so that he could take a nap. I told him I couldn't nap (my ear hurt), he said I could just lay with him. I said I didn't want to. Then he boisterously asked me ""o NOW you don't want to lay in this bed all day???"" I started crying again. He took a nap. 

The rest of the day was a sad blur for me. He did ask me later again if I thought he was abusing me. I cried some more and told him I felt so numb from the weekend's events, he said he did too. He asked if he ruined my weekend. I don't know. Then he went back to his game and I heard him again jokingly tell his friends I was looking at porn. I calmly, loudly said ""I don't think that's funny and it's definitely not nice."" He started saying that it's just his friend Whateverhisnameis and he was going to tell him that it was a joke eventually, and he didn't want me to be upset. I told him I wasn't upset, I just don't want him to say stuff like that about me because it's not funny and it's not true. 

So today I hopped on google to look up ""my partner makes me think I'm crazy"" and I found out about gaslighting. The thing is, I don't think my partner is abusive. I think he's wonderful, generous, kind, funny, I could go on and on. I know he is a little obnoxious when he teases me. And the thing is, ""gaslighters"" are always described in all these articles as psychopaths, as people so conniving and evil genius that they intend to make you feel this way... and I just don't think that's him. I think he's a simple dude. 

I guess it doesn't matter anyway because the financial hardships of this year devastated my savings account and credit score, and I have no family or friends that I'm close with. It's not like I could do anything about the situation. I just need to hear someone else's opinion. I feel so confused and lonely. What do I do? How can I fix this? Is my boyfriend an a word??

I am a 38 year old male who recently ended a relationship with my 28 year old supervisor. It has been a struggle to say the lease, as im sure you all know. We are still working on the same project together and I have to attend call-in meetings with her every morning. We are forced to communicate on a daily basis through emails and phone calls as well. She is the one who ended the relationship and she seems to be doing just fine. I have done plenty of reading and had a couple therapy sessions but most tips seem to include ""avoiding your ex at all costs"". This isn't an options for me and the fact that I am still in love with her (after 3 months apart) is making me a little concerned about whether or not I can stay with the company. I have tried making myself hate her but that just causes us to argue and makes me feel like shit. She has cut off all personal communication and treats me like just another employee and its a difficult and hurtful adjustment. I have good days and bad days, but the guilt and how it all ended just eats away at me. Does this ever end? I havent gone through a breakup in over 10 years..

Knowing what ""Pop your cherry"" means, drinking in moderation, going to clubs with friends to dance, and even swearing is really weird to treat in this way when you're already an adult, at least to me

EDIT: I'm still trying to figure out adulthood myself. I haven't gotten to go to clubs myself but I've always thought that these things were naturally expected part of growing up and becoming legal. I just personally find it strange to talk about these things in a way that's makes it seem unordinary and like you're going against the norm even though these are normal things

&amp;nbsp;

I don't know why this has been bothering me lately when it's such a small thing, but I'll just get it off my chest lol

So I was out with some friends and at some point we were talking about favorite soda flavors. One of them said they like ""Cherrypop"" and another mentioned how it sounds apparently really nasty. We asked why and they said ""It sounds like this really gross saying to 'Pop your cherry', you know what that means?"" The look on their face reminded me of when children are talking about adult stuff they found out and are telling their friends. Idk how to describe that expression. So I said Yeah I know. The one who likes cherrypop soda said haughtily that they've known what it means for ages. So our friend proceeded to explain it, but they huddled in and whispered the meaning to us for some reason? There weren't even people around us in a 30 foot radius, but they were talking about it like it was such a scandalous thing to talk about. Even though I thought ""Pop your cherry"" is a sexual idiom people commonly know. And I don't think it's a big deal to know unless you're a child/teen I guess. My friends are around 22, I'm 24

Then there was another friend of mine, 25 who I was talking to on the phone to catch up after years. So she was known as being a shut-in bookworm back in high school. She was an independent girl who had to do things on her own without her parents who were in a different state at the time. She told me how she got into some relationships and then proceeded to talk about how different of a person she is from high school. That she swears saying ""Shit,"" ""Damn,"" ""Pissed,"" and sometimes ""Fuck"" only if she's really mad. And that she goes to clubs with friends to dance and drink in moderation. She kept saying ""Yeah I'm such a different person now, right? I'm such a rebel, I'm not a Good girl like in high school"" and I would say ""Yep"" but I didn't understand what was the big deal about going to clubs to drink and dance and swearing. Anyone can do that of legal age. You can still be a Good girl who likes to dance with friends at clubs and drink moderately, let alone swear

But yeah idk I just find these things so weird. I think that, yes you're an adult. You know adult jokes, you can go do adult things as an adult. You're naturally not a child anymore, these experiences are a part of going into adulthood - growing up. I don't understand why these things seem so scandalous even at an age where you're legal to do what you want. Is this actually a big deal to people and I'm just indifferent to it?

I have consistently faced some really tough times and I’m so tired. I won’t go into the avalanche of turd that was pre-2020 but I’ll quickly note some things I’ve faced in the last 6 months:

- left a toxic engagement, leaving us both in a better emotional space. But the time leading up to the breakup was full of arguments and tension. 
- moved house four times before I had secured a unit. I donated more than half of my belongings because I simply couldn’t bring it with me. Bright side of this, is that I had friends who would let me board with them. 
- my psychologist went on maternity leave and my GP started experimenting with my medication (despite my wishes). I then took myself of antidepressants.
- got sexually assaulted in one of the houses. 
- had to quit my job due to lack of work and some mild bullying. I was receiving one shift every second roster and not earning enough to live on. 
- The Australian Government started phasing out the coronavirus supplement, pushing me into financial crisis. I was then informed I owed Centrelink money because of the coronavirus supplement. I was refused any help with my financial crisis.
- auditioned for a musical, and gained an ensemble role. This then got cancelled and I lost some passion for music. 
- I finished my Bachelor of Nursing and earned my dream position for the NSW Graduate Program. I then have been terminated and delayed because, despite passing a physical and being quite active and working in heavier roles, they have deemed me ‘light to moderate duties’. This risks my whole career in nursing and paramedics. I am in the process of contesting this, but it has caused great stress. I should hear the outcome of my contesting/provision of evidence any day now.
- my landlord has begun some intense scare tactics and I’ve been routinely harassed. I am powerless to do anything here without risking homelessness.
- all but a few friends have left as a result of the breakup. Things are amicable with my ex, but the friends apparently never liked me. 
- I have two months of continuing financial crisis. Centrelink is phasing out the supplement, my credit card stops being on hold, and I have about $10-$15 each pay for food and medication. 


All this has hit me today, when I was so hungry and my SO lovingly took me for brunch. During this, my mum called and started stressing me out by talking about the nursing, annoying my SO because I struggled to end the phone call. Then, after I had eaten 1/4 of my meal, a swarm of flies landed on my food. I just started crying and tried to hold it together in public. 

I was so hungry and it just broke me. I had ruined a meal because of my mother and my unwillingness to eat the fly food, essentially wasting food and being rude to the people who made the food. This was like a switch and I’ve just been upset all day.

Anyway, I just wanted to vent this. I hope it makes sense - I’m on mobile so the formatting might be wonky. 

And despite this, there are good things in my life, my SO is wonderful and I have a roof and access to water.

My parents have always taken my looks VERY seriously, and they're really fatphobic.

Just after dinner today, my mom told me that I looked ugly and fat. Now, this isn't the first time she's told me, so I told her, that no, I was not fat, and even if I was, I didn't care. She went into a full-blown lecture about how fat people die early, all the while poking at my stomach and arms. I repeatedly asked her to stop, telling her that this was the body I was born in, I can't change how it works.

(My school's opened for a few weeks, and it's been very exhausting. I usually come home tired af, so I haven't worked out quite as much as I'd like to.)

Mom uses this fact to point out how my cheeks were all droopy and that when I'll be her age I'll be nothing more than a bloated pig. Just then dad comes home from work, and mom tells him about how unhealthy I've become. He solemnly looks at me and says, we can't do anything, she's our daughter, and we'll have to deal with her.

I told them how they were body-shaming me, and if I ever developed an eating disorder, it would all be their fault. My parents tell me that I need to stop getting 'whitewashed', and mom adds that I should be grateful she gave birth to me, sends me to a good school, how she gave up her career for me. (They had me within a few months of their marriage, I was unplanned).

I tell them that they could've just aborted and saved themselves all the trouble, as I never asked to be born, and maybe then, they (my parents and my younger brother) could all pretend to be one happy family.

My mother started crying her eyes out at that, calling me an ungrateful brat, saying she wished she never had me. She has since then locked herself in her room and dad said he's disappointed with the lack of respect I treat them with, given that they're elder to me and my parents.

Everybody expects me to apologize and accept that what I said was way out of line.

I have never raised my voice before this, and now I'm actually wondering if I was the AH?

I've done a lot of soul searching. I'm ready to move on and do what I feel is right. We're going to get back together. We'll take it slow and see if this is what we both want. 

Of course it's a risk; a gamble. But, I'm willing to give it ago again. But, if it happens again i'm done and I won't forgive her. We're both at a new stage of life.  We've done a lot of talking on what we did wrong and how to avoid it. We're starting fresh but, won't forget what sin she committed in her past.  I feel the only reason I can forgive is she hid nothing from me. She's been open and honest to me, our kids and her family and friends. 

Why did she cheat? She said it was a mid-life crisis but, she later admitted she was weak and made a mistake. She was with her friends out drinking. A young guy started flirting and she ended up screwing him. her friends protested but, she just blew them off saying she's going to do it For the first time in her life somebody desired her. She told me right away. She fucked up. 
We kept close but, I kept my emotional distance from her and vice versa. 

A lot of what she said lines up to what she's said to her family and friends. Of course its possible she is full of shit but, if so she's a good actor and kudos to keeping her story straight all these years.  But, honestly, I believe it because we're much alike. I would have cheated if a young cute girl started flirting with me. I considered cheating before but, I'm a better person and never acted on my urges or rather I was never in a position to cheat. But, again, that's no excuse for her cheating. At least I didn't act.

As for why. We both had a good bit of chemistry. While we were in quarantine we got close together. I was the one who prodded and who suggested a get back. I'm taking a risk and it's always possible she'll do it again but, I'm doing what my heart desires.

We're both not the same shitty people we were. I'm in a better spot in my life. I'm happy, I hate my past self for avoiding my problems, for never actually caring for my kids or my wife. of course that doesn't excuse her cheating but, it is what it is. I'm ready to try again.

Hello World,

I am someone who's always enjoyed History class - but never studied past any mandatory courses. I've seen a few documentaries on WWI and WW2. But overall, my knowledge of history is quite scattered and random - at best I could score high than an average person on historic trivia - but don't really posses any meaningful knowledge.

Some contemporary issues I'm interested are things like US Politics and the current political climate. I'm interested in human rights - including things like BLM and the LGBTQ movement - as well learning about the radical right. Part of me want to jump into specific documentaries on these topics.

But I feel like I want to start from the past - further back. Understand these common themes through a more ancient and primitives' lens. Like - what were the political systems in the past - which ones worked - and which ones did not? Were their parallels events in history that match todays political climate? What does the French revolution tell us about our current political climate?

I just have some desire to get broader contextual understanding of the world. I'm looking to learn about this in the most digestible way (even though it makes me vulnerable to confirmation bias). So if you could recommend podcasts, documentaries and the like, that would be much much appreciated.

In a way - i want to re-learn history - in a way that is much more valuable.

Thanks and Happy new year!",0,0,AskMen,t5_2s30g,self,How does man develop a well information world view of the world?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/kod3zl/how_does_man_develop_a_well_information_world/,all_ads,18.0

I love my boyfriend and definitely see a future with him, we’re pretty in-sync and resolve most arguments quickly and without a lot of drama, etc. We were friends before and have been official for about one year. Currently we both live in separate three-roommate households in the same neighborhood and both of our leases are up at the same time (March 1st).

I’m burnt out from roommates and I’ve decided it’s time for me to live alone even though that will be a bit of a financial stretch. So far every studio I’ve looked at is missing a key amenity like an oven or bathroom sink, and I’m accepting I'll have to sacrifice something in order to live alone.

My boyfriend has been planning on signing his current lease again, his spot is massive, has two bathrooms, a magnificent view of the mountains, and he’s friends with his current roommates (L and J).

Here’s where the conflict comes in.  Last week my boyfriend’s one roommate J surprisingly  announced he would not sign again , leaving his spacious and large- studio sized room open. My bf has suggested I move in and we take that room. Leaving his old room as a spare. My bf and L have less than a week to decide if they stay or go. Me moving in would be the reason they stay.

I’m torn, it feels too soon to move in and I was ready to live alone for a bit. However his current place would be the same price as a shitty studio and it I wouldn't have to sacrifice any amenities *and* is close to work (i must walk or bus). There would be a spare bedroom to retreat to if I need space, and BF has made it clear he will give me solitude if needed. Getting a one bedroom really isn't an option (too lazy to explain).

I love him, and I’m basically friends with L as well. I’m not particularly worried about roommate conflict (for reference I’m so burnt out from roommates and eager to live alone  because I’ve had horrible luck living with others. I’ve lived with a literal witch, I’ve lived with a girl who would steal, and my current roommates are filthy and the one has moved her boyfriend in free of charge) but I am *worried* I might get sick of my boyfriend if I’m waking up and coming home to him daily. We spend a ton of time together (about 5 days a week), and 95% of the time I miss him when we’re apart, buuuut I still like having my own place separate from him where I can just be totally alone from time to time and I enjoy sleeping alone on weeknights. This will be the first time either of us has lived with a S.O. 

Right now I'm leaning towards moving in, but I'm still hesitant. I would greatly appreciate advice, insight, etc from the lovely folks of reddit. Thank you all for reading my rambling, chaotic post!

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; It feels like I’m between a rock and a hard place. I either get a small studio that will most definitely be missing key features, or I move in with my BF and our friend/roommate and sacrifice some autonomy but gain a huge, nice, modern apartment for a good price. It feels a little soon to move in, but I feel live we will eventually move in together anyways. This is both of our first times living with a romantic partner.

So my (16F) boyfriend (15M) has be contemplating for a while that he feels like a girl. He hasn't officially declared it so Im going to say ""He"" for now. I respect the LGBTQIA+ Community, im an ally. A straight ally. I love him more than you could ever imagine. We've been together 4 years and I really hope to spend the rest of my life with him. It would be a dream come true.

But he has recently told me that he has been thinking about the ""girl feelings"" and it is messing with him and making him hurt and depressed. I told him to be himself no matter what and to do what makes him happy, but he says he's scared I'll leave. And frankly, I am too. He's my dream guy and I love him dearly but i just am not comfortable dating a girl or a trans girl. I came into the relationship expecting to be with a guy and love a guy for a really long time. I also know I'm not going to stay in the relationship and tell him im okay with it and tell him that im happy with it if I'm not. I refuse to lie to him like that. 

He says that it makes him uncomfortable as well (he is growing up Christian) and he gets really upset with himself that he feels this way, but he can't shake the feeling. He wants it to go away but he doesn't know how. My lgbtq friends said that he can't really just make it go away, and the only way he can be happy with himself is to embrace it. 

What should I do? What should he do? We love each other very much but this is like a deal breaker I suppose. We have a lot of our life planned together, and we cant just throw that away. Can he really never stop the feelings he's getting? I'm also going to mention that he doesn't want ANYONE to know that he feels like this and that we dont have access to any kind of therapy or counseling.

Her life goal was to get married and eventually have kids and I wanted the same thing untill about after 2 years or so it just felt like she was never supportive of wanted I wanted to and always felt like she was very negative and I never felt like I was good enough for her. So I started to think well maybe marriage isn't what I want and we talked about that and she did get upset but I did try to explain how I felt but it seemed like when I tried to talk to her about her getting mad and upset over very small things she would just explode and end up saying things to hurt me on purpose. But keep in mind this was after she was stable from the shot but I did always keep that in my mind. She did get off the shot after just 1 year and things seemed to get better. So fast forward closer to the end of the year and it just seemed like we couldn't get a long, and either she was mad at me or I was mad at her. I do love her very dearly but I just couldn't seem to get it right. We did always try to tell each other I love you as much as we could but even that didn't seem to help. After a while of us arguing we knew our lease was coming to an end at the house we lived in so we decided we didn't want to stay any longer with her getting the other house and with me getting a property i was going to fix up and stay in for a while to give us time to think and give us space. Well she when it got really bad before the end of the lease was up she kept saying how she was going to leave me when the lease was up and just saying very hurtful things to me when I didn't really want to break up but after hearing that for so long I just felt like it didn't matter anymore. So after she kept on she said out of spite I should create a tinder or something because I needed to move on so I did. I never even used it but I created it out of spite and she found out that I made it and got very upset upset the next day (believe me I know it was very shitty of me to do that and I know it was very wrong and I did regret it i was just so mad) so she broke up with me. We eventually moved out. I realized that yes out of the toxic way we treated each other if we tried to fix it I know we could because I love her a lot and know I want to be with her for the rest of my life we just have issues we need to work out with each other. So fast forward 3 months of us not being together and we are still talking but not together. She says she wants us to grow and figure it out but not miss out on any opportunities but I dont want anyone but her and she says she wants me but if she meets someone perfect she could go to him. I really want to be with her and she says she wants be with me but she just wants to stay single for a while. No she isnt sleeping around or anything she is just talking to me. She still calls me baby and tells me she loves me. I'm just not sure what to do or where to go from here. I am sorry its very long but I need to put some back story in it.

Try to keep it, but ended up summoning its entire community to my front yard. Try to released it safely, but ended up hurting it more when I threw it up the sky.

It happened a decade ago when I was still a little brat. I was playing with toys when a crow flew into my window and got stuck in it. The first thing that flashed into my brain was: ""Ah, I am going to keep it as a pet after I rescue it."" 

After a brief moment, I released it from the window and felt happy about it. Then, I heard crows crying around the window and that was loud enough to scare the shit out of me. That was when I realized there were other crows too waiting for the stuck step-crow to be released. My mind got blanked and my first thought was to released it back to its community. So, I ran to my front yard while carrying the bird. The bunch of crows surrounded my front yard like they were trying to summon the devil, while waiting for their family member to be free. 

Guess what, my stupid ass FU again. I didn't check for any injuries and I assumed that the crow can fly normally. So, I threw him up like those pigeon scenes from Hollywood movies. It ended up flapping his wings for a little and DOVE into the ground. When I thought back about it, I even felt disappointed that it can't fly graciously like a white pigeon. Luckily, it was able to fly away with its friends afterwards.

Lesson learnt: never try to keep wild animals as pets and check for injuries when you try to released them.",0,0,tifu,t5_2to41,self,TIFU by trying to keep a crow as a pet,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/l2bw7v/tifu_by_trying_to_keep_a_crow_as_a_pet/,some_ads,6.5

My university has the final exams of the first semester on January and the students are complaining that they take place on-site: we have to travel to the city where the faculty is, take the exam and head back to our homes. Everyone knows that the classrooms are secure. Everyone knows that the measures are great at the faculty. And the deanship keeps saying that. We know. We've been taking classes in person since september. We know it's safe.

But what it isn't fucking safe is making a trip to a city which has a maximum alert, taking a train, or a bus, or sometimes both because transportation sucks in Galicia, sometimes during more than one hour, with lots of people because Renfe doesn't fucking care about people traveling in train like canned sardines and then return to a home where most of us are living with people +60 years old.

And students are complaining about that. We demand online exams not because we don't trust the institution's policies about covid, but because THE FUCKING GOVERNMENT IS REOMMENDING TO SELF-QUARENTEEN AND GO OUT JUST FOR THE ESSENTIAL. My city and many others are closed due to this, meaning you can't go in or out without a good reason, like an emergency or going to take care of an elder because no one else can. But of course taking an exam that has the option to be online is an emergency too apparently. So yeah almost 2/3 of the student body is putting their grandpas and parents at risk just because.

And the university has the audacity to hear these complains and say ""oh but worry not! The classrooms are safe! It's impossible to have an outbreak! :)"" Fuck you.

She has a long history of going from really terrible relationship to really terrible relationship in phases that seems to have a theme. I've known her for years but I just can't take it anymore because I have to deal with the fallout after each break up. Example: For a time she would date addicts of various types (mostly alcoholics) trying to be their savior and reason for recovery. Before lockdown she managed to kick that habit but seems to have moved on to dating people who are completely incompatible with her in political values. I know folks can have healthy relationships with those who have differing political opinions but I mean she's a hardcore progressive and the last 4 guys she's dated have been trump voters and fundamentalist Christians. (Edit: The longest relationship that she's had is I think about a year and that was before we met.  None of these relationships have lasted more than a year.)

It's the same cycle every time. She falls head over heels for a guy who is a bad match and once the honeymoon phase is over there are huge fights and months of being conflicted over ending the relationship and then she finally works up the courage to break things off and moves on to the next disaster. I know that folks will likely point out that she seems drawn to high conflict relationships but how do I confront her about this? I just want her to be happy and to learn that she doesn't have to settle for less than her standards when there are plenty of other options out there.

I'm a good listener but have a tendency to be overly blunt about things and need some help with how to explain my position to her in a nice way.

Between the two of us, she was the one that looked more invested, as i was coming from a difficult relationship and told her i was being cautious. Last week we had lunch with a friend of her and his boyfriend, it was a nice lunch. I was defensive about meeting her friends, but she told me it was not a big deal.

Three days ago i asked her if it was ok meeting the next day, she said it was ok and that we would talk about it after dinner to define logistics. I waited until 22.30-23, but nothing, told her i was waiting for her to tell me something and she says she was confused because she feels like she has to wait for me (sometimes i take some time to reply) while i don't. I said she told me to talk about it after dinner, so that was why i was waiting.

After that, nothing. Texted her asking to tell me if she was angry or if there was something else because i was worried. Tried to call. Today after the third day, i texted her saying i am very disappointed and hurt by her behaviour, but that i will not continue to insist on reaching out.

I am completely broken. First of all because i thought she was a kind and mature girl, and this means i didn't even comprehend who i had by my side

Note I’ve just got off work from a 12 shift so I was really tired at the time. I told her I am going to bed and muted her calls and text I soon woke up not remembering anything I did and I found out she blocked me on everything!! I start to have a literal panic attack I blacked out bc I couldn’t reach her and it was sudden. She soon unblocked me and told me that we’re done and asked me why I accused her I told her, “your Snapchat map gose off, (FYI I mean turned off like it’s not there same with life 360) and so is your life 360 a random times on the weekends and she immediately changes it to I love you but we can’t do this no more.

She ends up telling me all the horrible stuff I’ve done to her she actually resorted to cutting herself witch tore me apart bc I thought we were the perfect couple but she soon came out with “no matter what you did back then I’d smile and love you even if you cheated on me. ( also we were in a the type of relationship we’re the man can date another girl) it was her idea bc she wanted me happy I gave her multiple times to call of this type of relationship and just let it be use bc I was only happy with but I put her through so much pain bc I couldn’t see I was blinded by my own greed now I feel the way she dose and she has no love for me I told her I would do anything to make her happy she said she just wanted to stay single tell end of high school and go on with her life and I told her that I don’t want her to leave.

Just saying she came back to me 4 days after leaving me and in thoughs 4 days I was suffering I didn’t know what to do I start smoking pot all day and missing work bc I was so depressed I throw up from the thought that she had left me then one night she called and said she loves me and that talking with her friends helped. And one more note I have no friends or family that wanted anything to do with me I lived in my own place since I was 16 and was doing horrible I even started cutting and to the point we’re I was about to finish it all I was destroyed in the end side but I held it together for alittle long and survived.

I haven't  seen anyone for awhile, as I've been quarantining and so haven't met any  of my friends in-person.

To start  off, I was a newbie to Dnd starting off with my friend as DM a couple  months ago, but recently I've been feeling that he finds me a burden  during gaming sessions. He's been using the reasoning that I  need help  when making my characters, or I have no passion in actually playing.  Bear in mind this is about a couple months into playing together, and  I've honed my table-top role playing for a while by then with a variety  of games, so I don't feel I'm a drag. There are newer members being  added to the gaming sessions, and he gives out the reasoning that they  have more willingness to learn than I do, despite the fact that I've not  needed more help or was more confused on how to play during sessions  than anyone else. Whenever a new gaming campaign is started, he kicks me  out of the game and only lets me back in with a set of pre-requisites  that usually entail making a new character that he's satisfied with, or  when I can prove I don't need ""help.""

I'm  starting to feel like he's targeting me, finding faults where they  might not exist, and might not want to actually play with me. Very  objectively speaking, I don't find myself to need more help or ask more  questions than any other members, nor not contribute to role playing  enough like he says. I've plenty of practice with the basics of Dnd, and  with following rules.

I do feel a  little unfairly treated when he does this, because he's a friend and  it's expected for me to feel a little left out of our friendship and hurt when I  believe he intentionally does this because he might not want to game  together. Am I being unreasonable?

How would I approach him about this? Is he acting with the intentions I believe him to be? This is pretty important to me because we've been friends for a long time, so I would find myself hurt if he felt I wasn't adequate enough to game with him.

I love him with all my heart, and it's only recently hit me that I don't know if we have a real future together.

We don't live together; he's a 2 hour drive away and I see him once about every 2-3 weeks, which isn't ideal. We're in the market to buy a house and when I say ""we"" I mean ""I."" I have a stable, well-paying job and he is a food delivery driver. The house is going to be in my name as I have the means to buy one and he does not have more than maybe a thousand dollars to his name. I pay when we go out to eat, I pay when we travel out of town for a weekend, and I've even let him become an authorized user on my CC account to help out his credit (luckily there haven't been any issues with this). I also drive whenever we got out as he doesn't have a car. I finished college and he is still working on his GED, which has been going on for about 2-3 years now. 

My issue is that things are moving too slowly. He has said he wants to do things in life but there just isn't any progression. I told him 2 years ago that if I didn't see some kind of improvement, that I wasn't sure how I would feel later on. But I have stayed. Now that I think of it, it feels like I'm the mom and he's the child in this relationship.

Despite all this, I'm terrified to even think about ending the relationship. We are from very different families; mine is well-off and his has always struggled- my parents think I can do better but I never let it bother me. He loves and respects me entirely, we laugh and have fun together, we enjoy each other's company, and we very rarely argue, if ever. We just click and he is my best friend. I know it would crush him because he'd never see it coming, which only makes me feel worse as he's always struggled with phases of depression and it'd kill me knowing I hurt him. I have always wanted a future with him, but as time goes on it feels like we are stuck in this long-distance situation and that things won't work or I will start to resent him if he doesn't get it together.

So at my next shift I asked this other guy who was training (who was much nicer) how we knew if we had a table of Canadians since David had warned me that we have to take those tables. The second guy laughed and said that Canadian is company code for African-Americans and it's widely known in our company that they don't tip well so our company uses ""in-offensive code"" (yah right) so we don't have to come out and say it. 

I was floored.

I had planned to cook at home tonight but I spent the day studying and lost track of time, so my bf and I decided to order some Thai for delivery. I was already pretty exhausted at that point and the delivery took a little longer than usual to get here (maybe close to an hour). 

Fast forward past us devouring the food (I got a pad thai he got fried rice if anyone was wondering), I was stuffed and ready to kick the bucket. We cleaned up and I got ready for bed. Now I don’t usually take supplements, but I’ve been pretty busy with school lately and haven’t been getting my veggies in so I thought why not? The kind of fibre I had was in capsule form so I gulped it down with a heck load of water. 

Not the best idea, cuz I was in bed browsing reddit when I felt the need to burp. I shimmied around trying to induce it but nothing was coming up. Maybe it was cuz I was lying down? I sat up, and as soon as I did, felt it coming up. (I dunno if you guys have ever eaten fries too quickly and have it come back up later in a semi fry cluster form, but let me tell you that partially dissolved fibre capsules have a similar consistency.) I felt the clump come up, for a moment I forgot what I had eaten and bit down. The taste of gelatinous nothingness swept over my tastebuds, I tried washing it down with water but it was too late, it had made its home on my molars.

2000s) used to be so much better than modern cartoons


First off, i started to feel that cartoons were becoming unbelievably worse than ever when i was at 6th grade, when i was 11, after the olympics 



Here are some of my reasons why i stopped watching cartoons (except for Rick and Morty and stuff)

1: End Messages and story

Cartoons used to carry a message for everyone once an episode ended, take a look at the old Looney Tunes show, like the duck/rabbit season episode, if you blame someone for not liking 'em, you're gonna  regret it, nowadays, they don't have that kind of message at all! It's just bland characters enter a ""wacky"" situation and end up messing something else! Why??? Now, i know there are some shows like Adventure time, or steven universe that are different, BUT! Isn't this supposed to make me laugh instead of seeing weird ""anime"" things? there's also O.K k.o or something, you know what this thing is all about? A kid tries to become a ""hero"" by working on a supermarket, even if he learns absolutely nothing and it ruins the point of the ani- i mean cartoon in the first place! Cartoons now fail to demonstrate kids good life lessons, maybe that's why there isn't any good kids videos on video platforms



2: The Art Style


My god, what happened here? Did someone let a 6 years old go to the design room??? Why make so much effort in the 2000's only to completely ruin the art style? Let's take a look at Looney Tunes, or as it was called Wabbit once it first aired, just... WHY? WHY MAKE EFFORT ON THE 80's ONLY TO COMPLETELY NOT USE IT EVER AGAIN 40 YEARS WHEN ANIMES LIKE DRAGON BALL AND ONE PIECE LOOK BETTER?




3: 2d to 3d


Is it just me, or does 3d look weird compared to old shows? But they look better than the modern 2d cartoons, take a look at meet the robinsons, now compare it to the ben 10 reboot, why did this happen? A 3d cartoon movie from the early 2000s look better than modern cartoons!




4:  Characters


Characters are by far the most important thing if you wanna animate, whether it's a tree, or something like that, characters felt so alive and full of personality back then, look at Jerry, he's just a mouse right? Yeah, but he would do funny things that would make Tom's plans fail, like that one time where tom got a shotgun, or the piano, and btw, early cartoons had the characters move a lot, like in Cuphead, but now? Hah! Get this, characters now have few animation frames, and it makes them look weird, like fr, have you ever seen someone say something to you whilst they are doing one pose for 4 minutes that should be impossible to be completely stationary?

Besides, when they finish their animation they become idle... for some reason






And even weirder is that most Adult Cartoons don't even have these problem like rick and morty and stuff, so wtf is with all of this?  


5: Background


So now we move to having a home with a fireplace with christmas tree and all of that to... a background with a random color? Even the sky isn't safe, it's just white, blue or orange or black, which looks weird



Well, there are lots of other things... but i'll call it a day for this

**Long bit of context;** I (F) am taking school online this year, and currently failing one of my 8 classes. The class I happened to be failing is business. It's an elective course I decided to take thinking it would be a nice little intro to the world of marketing. Boy oh boy was I ever wrong.

I'm not a math-skilled person by any means, I pass my math classes with a 75 average but struggle and need extra help. When I signed up for business (yes I read the syllabus, it was outdated because this is my professor's first year teaching online) I expected to be taking more of a crash course that skims over the practical functions of running a business and marketing.

This however was not the case, my professor has a very math-oriented style of teaching, which I found out the hard way once I began the course.

From the beginning, this professor's teaching style has rubbed me the wrong way, I'm taking enhanced classes but this is one of my only academic ones. He also took personal offence when I would ask clarifying questions on material I didn't understand and even went as far as to refuse to answer my emails.

Now, usually this wouldn't bother me and I would continue to try and continue, but it's an elective course that I wouldn't have taken in the first place, and I can make up the credit in the summer when I hopefully fast track some courses for next year. I stopped working for his class a couple weeks ago due to personal problems that I don't want to share giving me less time and more stress everyday.

&amp;#x200B;

**So, here's where I fucked up;**

I've been in contact with the course counsellor who's warning me repeatedly that I'm in danger of losing my credit, and she decides she's going to call me to tell me about my options and help me get that credit. I've spoken to her before and she's very light and bright and feminine sounding, if that makes sense. Another key piece of information is that I get 4-5 scam calls asking to clean my ducts EVERY DAY, so I've got a quick trigger on the red end call button when my phone shows No Caller ID.

As you can guess by the title of the post, it wasn't my course counsellor who called me after all but my heavily accented, older, male professor. Our conversation went like this:

**Me:** Hello?

\*silence\*

**Me:** Who is this? Hello?

**Professor:** Hello, I am calling-

At this point I didn't recognize his voice and thinking he was a telemarketer went ""Ugh, not again"" AND **HUNG UP THE PHONE.**

The icing on the cake of it all was that I never realized until I received a fairly angry email from him half a day later! I doubt I'll be getting that credit now, thanks for reading my cringe-worthy student fail :)

&amp;#x200B;

**Tl;dr: I mistook my professor, who was trying to help me get my course credit, for a telemarketer and hung up on him very rudely, then didn't realize what I'd done until he emailed me**",0,0,tifu,t5_2to41,self,TIFU By hanging up on my professor and possibly costing myself a course credit,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/l4w8jb/tifu_by_hanging_up_on_my_professor_and_possibly/,some_ads,15.5

So, this story begins in late October 2020 when I made an Instagram account for fun and soon I started meeting a lot of new people there and also I met this girl that had same interests as me she had very good taste in music and overall an really nice girl and she just happened to be from a whole different country and a year older than me. At first I liked her but it wasn't that serious and also I didn't want to immediately make a move because I had just broken up days before meeting this girl and was still trying to recover from it and didn't want to start a whole new relationship. but soon we started talking like regularly for hours and I absolutely fell in love with her and I tried to look for signs but after getting no signs I settled with the thought that I probably got friendzoned by her and moved on but soon after I started to get messages from her friends, like complete randomly and they would say things like she always talks about me with them and she liked me and as any guy at the situation would be I was completely shocked, asking myself questions like, ""are they pranking me?"", but again I  thought nothing of it and I thought they were probably just trying to joke with me and soon they stopped messaging me and months went by normally me and the girl didn't talk about it and we kept on talking with each other regularly like always until one day I got floods of messages from her friends, again and this time ALL her friends messaged me and tried to talk with me I was a little wierded out and thought it was just a big coincidence but soon they started to ask me questions about her(the girl) and they started saying things like she likes you dude! she is obsessed with you and I didn't know what to do at the time and panicking I told her liked her that I liked her too and since then we have been in a good relationship, she loves me I love her everything is happy and fine, now lets call this an ""online relationship"" and PEOPLE this is where the problem begins because we are from completely different countries and like thousands of miles away from each other and as all of you know a relationship needs that physical aspect to be filled too. An relationship where we get to see each other face to face is much better than an online relationship where you two just message each other the same lame things everyday like ""I love you"" and asking boring questions like ""how are you"", everyday without seeing each other in real, eventually someone is going to get bored of it. And also a lot of disadvantages comes with an online relationships as you cannot see or know if your partner doing something behind your back and if they are cheating on you, like you are oblivious of what they are doing and being in an online relationship causes a lot of misconceptions and these don't even last more than 3 months in my opinion and if lucky it would last like for what? 7 months?. So, I came here to ask help for my current situation with online relationship because the girl that I am in love with is an very wonderful, beautiful, loving and caring person and I DO NOT wanna lose her.

Me and my gf have been together for almost 5 years now and we started dating when we were 16 and 15. She was a virgin at that time and I wasnt due to some stupid mistake i made (which i now forgive myself from). From the start she said she wanted to wait with having sex, and I was absolutely cool with that. Before we had a relationship she was with another guy who pushed her to think about sexual things and touch his junk while she actually wasnt ready for it. She didn't really do those things but he was very suggestive towards that. Later she told me that she feels like she didnt say no enough. At the start of OUR relationship we did do some handsy, while at the time she told me she was ready for that because i made her feel comfortable and safe, afterwards now that i think about it i feel like there were some signals at that time which I might should have picked up upon. During that time I repeatidely asked whether she was okay with everything we were doing and she told me she was. These signals were mostly being uncomfortable during, which I thought then at the time to be more inexperience with the whole situation as she hadnt really had a lot of sexual interaction before (with someone else or with herself), but she did seem to enjoy it.  


Fast forward to 5 years later (now). The libido of me and my gf are quite different. I could have sex every 2-3 days and for her its more like once or twice a month. At the moment we basically live together and have also discussed this thing many times before. As I can get sexually frustrated and she doesn't want to feel pressured into it. And this is never my intention to pressure her into anything. We basically discussed that for her it would be nice, if i just wouldnt touch her unless she starts touching me first in a clear and precisely sexual manner. Last week she was very handsy and altough it felt like she wanted to have sex, in the end she didnt. This is Totally fine for me and I ofcourse dont want to pressure her into anything she doesnt want.(we discussed this later and she actually wanted to have sex but in the end, her head was to full with other stuff, so she didnt want to in the end). I went away for a couple of days and I felt like our chemistry was there but it started to frustrate just a tiny bit that we would almost start doing the deed and she would back away, but as I said i dont want to be pushy so I dont mention it. Yesterday I came back, and she told me she did the deed herself, which kinda bummed me out as I always try to safe myself for her. My shitheadbrain started to freak out later in the day that i noticed she wasnt into me at all during the day, as she was the week before. This is where the fuck up happens. During tickling out of some sort of horny weird frustration I grabbed her boob, which she totally didnt like. Because I have done so before in an attempt to get something started( nothing aggressive but just holding it). My dumb brain didn't connect the dots that she had done the deed and thats why she wasnt into me at all that day. Now she is mad at me and thinks that all I want to have is sex and I dont want anything else from her. I have apoligized many times now and i feel like a dumb fuck, but on the other hand I feel like she isn't respecting my sexual wishes either. I don't know what to do or how to handle it. And i Feel like our difference in sexual wants is breaking us up.

After my ex husband and I split he starting coming over and helping me through everything. After a few months and back and forth my ex and I were done for good. Significant other and I got together. 

We've been publicly dating almost 2 years and living together for 1. We did end up getting married, but due to covid we are waiting on telling everyone and having a ceremony.

Well one of the times EX dropped off kids they slipped and called SO ""dad"" this does not happen a lot, but does sometimes. At first we corrected then , but after 2 years and talking to oldest to make sure she understands SO is not her dad we decided to not MAKE them stop. I firmly believe its the children's choice so long as they know this is not their ""dad"" and that their dad will always be their real dad. (Confusing I know, but oldest even said SO was like a step dad cause we live together and he's with mommy..she's a smart cookie) 

Ex is furious with my believe and says its OUR choice to make for them. I strongly disagree. And EX things I'm doing this to hurt him. That is not my intent. 

Here is the last message I sent:

I am not mad, but I will stand up for how I believe the girls should be raised. 

We corrected them in the past, but it's been almost two years.. sometimes they slip cause they see him as a parental figure. 

Because he is here there is no stopping that view of him in their eyes. He cleans with them,  cooks and eats,  and plays..

This is their ""unit"" 

It's not even constant. Or even everyday. But I stand firm it's their choice to make. 

We have had talks with [oldest]. She knows [so] is not her dad. [Youngest] calls him ""my [so's name]"" most of the time. 

There are the rare slip-ups..it happens and I'm not stomping that out of them. 

I'm sorry.
Its THEIR choice. 
It has nothing to do with you apart from hurt feelings.

Should you enter a long term relationship they will probably do the same with her and I KNOW and accept that even though it will sting some.  It happens.

While there, I started talking to this girl that’s my age. At first I didn’t think she liked me; she’s very blunt and somewhat socially awkward and would sometimes make rude comments. I later found out that she wasn’t trying to be rude. That said, I didn’t realize she wanted to be friends until she asked me if I wanted to do a gift exchange for Christmas. I said yes, and it was fun.

After that, we had several topical conversations before she asked me for my number. From my understanding, she was going to use my number to put in a coworker group chat and maybe text me about work, but she started calling and texting me several times a day. It was a lot. For context, I’m not even that great at responding to my close friends of several years, but I wanted to give this friendship a fair shot. I try to respond to the calls at least once a day and text throughout the day. I’ll be completely honest and say that I don’t always respond right away because sometimes I feel overwhelmed, but I always try to get back to her within a few hours. I also “met” her childhood friend via text; she would take my friend’s phone and text me lots of questions.

A few days ago she mentioned via text that she viewed me as a sister. I didn’t know how to respond to that, so I just told her that I was happy she was my friend. Fast forward to today; I was stressed out after work, so when I saw her texting and calling me, I didn’t respond right away. An hour and a half later, I finally returned her phone call, but it bounced to voice mail. 

A few minutes later, her childhood friend was texting me from her line. She said she didn’t trust me and asked me a bunch of questions. At some point my friend got her phone back and told me I had disappointed her tonight, which was fair, and I apologized. I guess she was afk after that, and her friend got her phone back and continued to interrogate me. At one point she asked me “do you consider her family?” and I hesitated as I tried to compose an answer, so she said “I guess that’s a no.” I explained to her that it took me a long time to feel familial about people, but that I did care about her. 

Her friend urged me to tell her. So when she got her phone back, I tried to tell her as kindly as possible that while I didn’t view her as a sister, I hoped to be a good friend (ad improve my spotty communication) and to treat her the way a sister would treat her. She sent me a few sad face emojis and logged off for the night.

For context we both discus how we wanted to be very safe with sex, but for reasons that aren't relevant she can't get the pill or injections right now, so condoms and cycle tracking. That day was a fertile day. When I'm taking her home I ask her why she did that, and she tells me that she: ""Wanted to see my reaction, to test if I was also gonna be careful in the moment"". While she seemed genuine when she said it, she is a very smart person and frankly I think that explanation is dumb.

I talked to some of my friends about it and they both said that she probably wanted to have sex without protection, and was trying to get me to do it. Next time I see her, probably next week, I am going to talk about it with her. Do you think this is a bad boundary push?

Several months ago, back at the start of September, I (18m) posted here about my dying relationship and not long after ended things with my ex (f17). It wasn’t particularly conclusive, as I didn’t have any electronics at the time and thus didn’t really get a chance to talk with her about any of it. However back then I knew and I still know it was the right choice looking back at the relationship, as it was pretty toxic, especially at the end. Most of my friends I’ve talked to about it have agreed with me and several even told me they didn’t like her when we were together, so all in all I’m fairly confident that, although I was far from perfect, a good portion of the blame lies on her and I shouldn’t have much reason to continue to look back on it.

Yet for some reason I still continue to look back on it and can’t seem to move past it. It find that at times I’ll become frustrated with her and with what she did and at other times I’ll focus on myself and what I did wrong and wonder if that would’ve changed things (although I doubt it).

Making matter’s worse, I decided to contact her to wish her a merry christmas as we hadn’t left off on too bad of terms, and from there the conversation spiraled into a discussion of what went wrong in our relationship where she accused me of gaslighting and guilt tripping her, among other things. All in all, if I had any confusion as to where the blame potentially lied for the failure of our relationship before, this discussion essentially decided to take that and explode it.

Ultimately I know, or at least feel like I know, that logically it mostly rested on her and that I was right to end things, but emotionally I find that I’m still more wound up in this than I want to be. Is there any advice that y’all have that would help me move on or any explanation as to why I still feel this way despite the better part of 4 months having past?

Also I’ll end this that I acknowledge the benefits a therapist would give, but that it’s not something I really can do at the moment.

(I’ll tag the other users in the comments).
My point was: if a fight breaks out at school, *both* kids ought to be punished for that. 

Now, punishment in this case is probably detention and counseling. A teacher or counselor should sit down with both kids and have them talk it out. If it turns out one has been bullying the other for long, then sure, maybe there should be some additional punishment for that, but the fact is that both of them either decided or agreed to fight it out, and that mindset just shouldn’t be accepted at a school. Even when you’re being bullied, that doesn’t suddenly give you the right to kick someone’s ass and magically come out unscathed. 

There’s millions of ways to avoid a fight. First of all: an asswhooping doesn’t just come from nowhere. There’s probably been some friction going on and tension building up to it. Someone ought to have called out to a teacher waaay back before shit hit the fan. Secondly: even when a fight “starts”, it’s usually not just because some kid suddenly smacks you across the face. There’s build-up to the moment, giving you plenty of time to just tell the bully to fuck off or even yell for help. 

I know that’s not easy. I know that’s the “coward’s” way out. But just the fact that you *think* you’ve got no other option than to stand up for yourself, doesn’t clear you of all responsibility. Getting into a fight means getting into trouble for it afterwards, it’s just part of the equation. You might be to pumped up on adrenaline to think straight, and again: I’m not at all condemning anybody who chooses to fight, I’m just saying you’ll have to accept the repercussion of your choice afterwards as well. 

Everybody knows violence is not the proper answer, so everybody who does get into a fight should be held accountable for their part in it. This is what teaches kids responsibility. Paraphrasing the great Bill Burr: there maybe plenty of reasons to hit someone, you just don’t do it. 
If you’re man enough to swing at somebody, you gotta be man enough to face the consequences for your actions. Just whining about “but he started it!” is for toddlers.

Now, let me also point out: I’m talking about a fight at school. I’m not talking about armed robbery in the streets or attempted murder or something. Those were arguments people would throw at me, “what if someone tried to kill me and I just acted out of self defense?”, that’s not what I’m talking about. Just two kids, duking it out with their fists, maybe even just slaps. 

I sincerely believe that, as soon as a fight breaks out between two people, *both* of them are equally guilty of fighting.
Certainly, if it turns out one of them has been bullied for years, the teachers ought to take some extra measures and not just call it a day after breaking up the fight, but still, “standing up for yourself” doesn’t magically grant you immunity. With that mindset, you’re raising a bunch of psychopaths who believe violence is justified as long as it serves their cause. 

Violence is never justified, no matter the situation. It may be necessary, but it should never be without consequences. That should be the lesson.",0,0,unpopularopinion,t5_2tk0s,self,"When two kids fight at school, both kids should be punished.",https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/kqtz3b/when_two_kids_fight_at_school_both_kids_should_be/,all_ads,9.5

When I was in primary school, (elementary school for US) I had a mid 50 year old male teacher who I knew from the start was creepy. All the other teachers and staff talked so highly of him because of how involved in morning activities he was. He came up with the idea to run a yoga class for morning sport periods, he would run yoga and other teachers would run soccer or cross country or whatever. 
We were all about 10/11 when this started. I would notice how during these yoga classes, he favoured a couple certain poses, downward facing dog was his ultimate favourite. He seemed to focus on the female students more than the boys. Which of course I thought was weird. He would tell us all to go to downward facing dog, keep your head straight to the ground close your eyes and breathe. While he would circle around the class and assumingly look at the girls wearing skirts and shorts, weirdly he made it a requirement for girls to wear only shorts or skirts for yoga. It wasn’t completely obvious at the time but I realise now he was recording it all for later usage. 
Also, he insisted on taking classes to swimming lessons at the beach. He would be really annoying about changing into a fresh pair of clothes in the change rooms before going to and from the beach. At the time I thought fair enough. A couple years later when I was in high school, I seen on the news that this teacher had up and left school during the middle of a school day with no indication of why or where he went. People were worried for him at first, until they realised his secret. 

A day later it came out that another teacher found this teachers sneaky camera pen device. One of many. It turned out that for all those years, yoga, swimming lessons, god knows what else, he would have his camera pen watching it all. He would leave his jacket hanging up in the girls change rooms with the pen camera facing the students, while they got changed for swimming lessons. He was then on the run after being caught out, I assume he thought he was caught out before he actually was, hence why he left during the middle of the day with no explanation. 

A couple days later everything was released to the public, this teacher had been selling and editing child pornography on the dark web, and you bet all the footage from the years at my school was apart of it. So many girls at my school were seen repeatedly in all the footage, naked vulnerable and young. I’m not sure as to whether he did the same for us boys but regardless, he was filming and distributing videos of my peers to other pedophiles for money, and probably his own sexual pleasure, for years. They found piles and piles of footage on his home computer, in the same house his kids and wife lived in, Oblivious to his true nature. 

He was eventually caught by police, brought before the judge and on behalf of his psychologist, he got away with it all. His psychologist apparently pleaded that this teacher was suffering from depression and other mental illnesses, and that it would not be fair to put him in prison. 
I have no clue why the judge felt pity for this man but to my knowledge he is in protective custody somewhere else away from where angry parents and teachers could find him. I’m sure he is still doing similar shit today, whatever ways possible. It makes me sick to think about this man being put on such a pedestal by other teachers and staff during my schooling days, they all assumed he was a passionate teacher who wanted to see kids reach their potential. In reality he became a teacher to fulfil his sick urge, which he would still be catering to, to this day. 

This teachers name is Colin Lyons,
I will put a link below to the news article of the incident.

UPDATE:
the second article in which includes the incriminating story of Mr. Lyon’s pen camera child pornography scandal, can no longer be linked to Colin Lyons. The second article refuses to give out his name. I’m assuming it’s because he is in protective custody and he made some sort of deal to wipe his name from anything negative online. I vividly remember seeing the article, having my entire high school talk about it, during assemblies and meetings, I know it happened. And so does everyone that I went to school with. I’m so frustrated that this man gets a free pass and anyone that wants to research his disgusting acts can no longer have proof. He is only known online now as a “beautiful man” thanks to the first article. This pisses me off greatly, no man that gains the trust of his students, friends and peers, just to hoodwink them all with his paedophilic ways, should be allowed to have their slate wiped clean. And be known to anyone that researches him as a good person. Fuck you Mr. Lyons.

For some context : I (20F) live in a strict society where dating isn’t easy specially for girls. 

So my cousin (30F) started a relationship with someone Mark (32M) (fake name). Mark is divorced with a little girl. After one year of dating and 6 months being engaged, he missed his ex-wife and his daughter (which is understandable). So after a lot of problems they broke up. 
Before they were engaged he had already bought an apartment and she bought most of the furniture. 

This is where the a-hole part starts : my dad asked me about it, he wanted to know when will the wedding be, I said that there won’t be a wedding and explained the reasons above. I also mentioned the apartment and that’s why my mom says I’m the a-hole. She said that I ruined my cousin’s reputation and that my dad will judge and think that they probably had sexual relationships and as muslims we must not have them.

I'm a secondary (US middle/high school equivalent) school student in London, and as I live quite far from my school I have to commute there on the Tube. Unfortunately for me, my school's in central London and I'm not, and I get to/leave school right in the middle of rush hour. I commute from the edge of Z2, and it's nearly impossible to get a seat **unless** you happen to be lucky enough to get a train running only part of the route. From the station I commuted from, most trains started 10, 7, or 5 stops away, however, a few trains per hour started at the station right before, and as that station is quite quiet, it's possible to get a seat.

I happened to get on this train and, when I boarded, there were about 20-25 seats free. The next station, a young-ish lady boarded... By this time, all the seats were taken. She stood in the gangway right next to my seat and tutted and sighed. I noticed it, but she didn't make indication of wanting a seat, and I continued listening to some music.

About five stations later it was time to get off, and unfortunately, the lady left the train too. As I was walking up the platform to get to the exit, she brushed past me \*just\* strong enough that it probably wasn't an accident. She then continued to strut quickly along the platform and up to the exit, and I didn't think much more about it.

Now, I'll make this clear, if she asked politely, I'd have probably gave up my seat. If someone was elderly, disabled, or pregnant, I would have given it up without question. But if you're just a standard person who makes no indication of wanting the seat, I'm not going to give up. Did she think I could mind-read?

To me they're gross, slimy, and have a weird taste. In my opinion, the only thing tomatoes are good for is BBQ sauce and pizza sauce. Everything else is abhorrent to me. If you like tomatoes I'm glad as you can enjoy a wider variety of dishes. However, my grievance with tomatoes is that in my opinion they should be used in cooking less.

If you're one of the unlucky people (like me) who hate the fruit it's hard to escape them at restaurants or at cookouts. Sometimes, I'd like a burger but it comes with a tomato even though the menu didn't say anything about a tomato! Want a salad? Here's some greens covered with chopped tomatoes on top (so the juice everywhere). Looking forward to eating some pasta and specifically mention NO TOMATOES. End up with it covered in sun-dried tomatoes. 

So, I think people should start leaving tomatoes off of some dishes (e.g., salad) or at least remember that not everyone enjoys them (could even be allergic) and put them on the side instead. 

So, that's my strong unpopular opinion on tomatoes, since most people I think like them. :D",0,0,unpopularopinion,t5_2tk0s,self,Tomatoes are the SCUM of the fruit world and shouldn't be used in cooking so much,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/l69asm/tomatoes_are_the_scum_of_the_fruit_world_and/,all_ads,85.5

Ty to those who have passed judgement so far.
I just wanted to clarify something. I don’t feel entitled to have a relationship with him when he is older just because I’m his aunt.

She's on her first year at medicine, and now we're on the final exams period.

There are few certain facts that I am really concerned about.

First of all, she's afraid of those exams, she's drinking way too much coffee in order to stay awake so she could study more. I tried to explain her that this method can harm her health but she's not listening to me, whatever I say she just keeps going on like that. She's been drinking coffee a lot but right now she's just gone crazy with it... This thing really annoys me because I feel like I'm just wasting my time...

Other fact is the way she's avoiding me in this period. We haven't talked for few days now which is kind of unusual for us.. and prolly I must give her some space. It's just last time we talked she was sad and she said "" I am drugged with too much caffeine "" and I told her that maybe she needs something else, the feeling that she is loved, so she can move forward, I mean, yeah I totally agree that she's busy, I'm busy too but at least I can make time to help her.

And I should also say about her separation of love and career, because she said I'm a distraction for her so she can't focus on learning when we're staying together. Also, career means a lot more to her, and I totally agree with that, but I feel like she doesn't want me to be in her whole life, I mean she wants me only when things go well and when they go opposite then she's starting to disregard me. Right now we're staying with our parents because of pandemic, and we used to met couple times a week and have a sexy time which we totally enjoy. In couple months, our unis will call us ""face 2 face"" and we'll separated by 200+ miles so it would be really difficult for us to see each other...

After all that I am just thinking that it's better for us to stop because I believe we're seeing love in a very different perspective. As far as I've seen for her, she's puting love and her feelings aside when things are getting tense and she's behaving like nothing matters more than her own shit. Although for me, I am trying to see our love as something that motivates me and it gives me energy to continue through hard times.

My point is that I would rather try to combine love and career than to separate them at all.

I've been chatting to a young man who lives in another country, about 2'500 miles away from me, for a year now. First, it was like a normal small-talk, then a conversation about life, each other's jobs and slowly we also started to flirt here and there, but agree that we don't want to meet irl or bring it to another level. It's almost like an anonymous friendship, at least not generally superficial or random.

We exchange texts once a week when things are OK, but he has episodes in which he won't even open my message for 4 or 6 weeks. Not blessed with self-confidence myself, I thought it was about me, and the usual, reasonable reaction would be to realize he's not interested in continuing the chats and let it go. 

But he always comes back, apologizes for letting me wait for so long, tells me things are weird with him, tells me he likes me, tells me our conversations mean a lot to him, and hopes I'm not mad at him, but never actually explains why it takes him so long to reply. I never asked, though, but it hurts somehow, because I blame it on myself, although he always told me it was the way he is and all was fine with me. He encouraged me to keep sending texts, told me how much he enjoyed chatting with me and things are great whenever he finds the time. 

When I ask what he spends his days like, he says mostly sleeping, or drinking much alcohol. Sometimes he spends his nights gaming, up to 12 hours, and mentioned he had 35 unread messages on Facebook that he ignores by habit. I receive messages out of nowhere at 3 a.m. He's currently unemployed. All this made me think whether these are hints he might be depressive. I'm terrible oblivious and naive. He lives alone. I told him he doesn't have to text me back immediately and I don't expect much. 

Now... it's been 5 weeks since I've last heard from him, and I feel how it makes me insecure, worried and it keeps playing on my mind. I wonder if it's my fault or if something happened. I spend much time thinking about it, but I can't do anything to interrupt the silence. He will text me when he's ready, and until then, I can write as much as I want to, it won't be read. 

Is there a gentle way to ask him how to help him, or a way to ask if he's struggling with mental problems? Or is that too straight forward? I care about him, he's well-educated and incredibly friendly and used to volunteer his time to help the elderly, he worked for a charity and was one of the few guys who never sent me creepy messages, even when he was drunk (yeah that's noteworthy). I spend months wondering why he acts like that, now I guess I probably have found the answer. 

On the other hand, if this keeps bringing me down (and it actually has an impact on my daily productivity and it makes me sad), should I let it go and even delete the contact? Sometimes it's so difficult to wait and wait for a sign, I wonder why I even bother. He's not my only friend, and should I only respect his needs whilst ignoring mine? 

I'm really conflicted here. 

tl;dr: chat partner could be depressive, I'm not sure whether I can help or better distance myself from him because it can be nerve-racking.

We don't live in a town that has much to do except work, eat, and sleep. We go and do things on the holidays (mostly with his family because I abandoned mine for the most part), which is fine and all but unless there is something special about the day he is unlikely to do something to spend quality time with me. Instead he plays a video game or we watch a movie and go to bed.
    
     I am normally okay with this, but whenever I want to do something simple he refuses and then jokingly asks if I'm going to cry about it if he doesn't agree to do it. I say no but of course I always do end up upset. I think he feels that I am trying to guilt trip him even though I have told him I would never want to do that. I just want to spend some time with him in the real world and he has a problem with motivation.

     For example, it snowed in our part of Texas yesterday. I hadn't seen snow in probably three years so I told him I'd like to go out with him and make a snowman. He is from Iowa originally, so I understand that he's tired of snow, even though he lived in Iowa 6 years ago. He said no, and I wasn't going to get upset until he made a joke about me probably crying about it later and I think that's what really made me sad. Another time I asked him to go on a walk with me on a nice Saturday and that led to tears as well.

     Now, he is all for me going out to do whatever it is by myself, but the special part of going for a walk or building a snowman is doing it with him, you know? 

     The thing is, his job is causing him extreme stress and I know he has a hard time wanting to do anything. I don't want to get upset about it because it isn't his fault, and I don't want to get upset about the ""you're gonna cry aren't you"" jokes because I actually think they're funny. That's the sort of thing we joke about on a daily basis. I am kind of easily upset because I'm on a new birth control and I am also job-stressed, so I feel awful when I start to cry because the situation is so ridiculous. 

     Maybe the real reason I get upset is because I'm frustrated that his job has drained him and I wish he could be happier. It would be great if we could live without the looming cloud of the army over our heads, but it'll be almost two years until it passes. No therapy has helped him, and I'm doing my best here to try and help but I'm just not getting through.

     Anyway, then he feels bad that I'm crying and wants to make amends by doing the thing he didn't want to, but I don't want him to do it out of guilt and I've already been turned off of the idea because it became an ordeal. So then we are left sitting in our room, me trying not to cry and crying a lot and him wondering what to do and frustrated that he can't fix it.

    TL;DR:   It's not his fault he doesn't want to do the thing because his job has made him depressed, but it hurts me because it feels like he doesn't want to do things with me even though that's not the case and I feel like I'm failing to help him with his depression.",0,0,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,self,"I (18f) hate getting upset when my SO (21m) doesn't want to do anything (pretty long post, tldr at the end).",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/kvalat/i_18f_hate_getting_upset_when_my_so_21m_doesnt/,all_ads,1.5

Characters:

OP = me (72M)

MW = my wife (70F)

E = son (38M)

K = daughter (40F)

M = daughter’s boyfriend (25M)

K is MW’s daughter so my stepdaughter. She is 40 and divorced for 5 years.

M is her boyfriend, live-in and is 25 years old. In my mind I call him her boy toy or fuck buddy.

I do not approve of this relationship because it continues her bad choices in men since her divorce. Before M there was R from Great Britian. He was a no job loser who K spent thousands and thousands of $ on trips to GB and also bringing him on trips to the US. K doesn’t have a pot to piss in and has also has borrowed $45 to $50 K from us over these 5 years.

Moving on to E, MW’s son moved into our house in June of 2020. He was working haphazardly. He then got a good job I think in Aug. or Sept. He is still with us but he doesn’t cause me too much stress. He leaves lights on quite often and is the biggest slob I’ve ever seen, but I expect that of him so it only causes me minor stress. He has been this way from the day I first met him when he was 16 years old. His job lets him work from home on average 2 days a week.

M and K both lost their jobs and having no money they had to give up their apartment in LA and so they moved in with us on October 1st 2020. M is the cause of the major jump in my stress level. First, for the reason above, secondly because he is a freaking stranger and is now living in my house full time. In 3.5 months all I have seen him do is sleep until noon, play video games and watch cartoons on tv, smoke pot and drink vodka every single day. I also find him very often to be very loud. Another big problem is that I was not asked if it was OK for him to move into my house. My answer if I had been asked would have been NO. He has family in LA. He could have moved in with.

ISSUES THAT HAVE COME UP THAT HAVE CAUSED STRESS &amp; FIGHTS:

1- After a month I went downstairs around 11 pm and I found the kitchen lights, 6 overhead 100 watt lights on when they were in the family room playing computer games. I am a retired engineer and am very energy conscious. So I told them about it that why are you running 600 watts of lights when they are not needed. K threw her mother under the bus and said that MW had put them on and left them on. I said that they should have enough sense to turn them off since they were downstairs. K didn’t like the tone of my voice. According to her I was yelling at them. I was STERN but not yelling. I guess she is not used to having any form of criticism.

2- Mid November they went on an overnight camping trip with E. They also have a habit of not turning off tv, lights, air conditioning, fans etc. So that evening after they were gone, I went to open their bedroom door to check if everything was turned off. Their door was LOCKED.

When they returned I found that they were locking the door in the daytime when they were both out of the room. This occurred day after day after day. I’m 72 years old and I’ve never locked a bedroom door my whole life. My thoughts went to him having drugs other than pot in my house which he was trying to hide. There are no thieves in my house and nobody is snooping through anybody else’s stuff. My stress level went up incredibly with this.

Maybe a week later we finally had a discussion about this and their explanation was privacy. I said you don’t need privacy when you are both out of the room. His explanation was that they sometimes leave sex toys lying on top of the bed and they don’t want us to see them. Sure thing, but I find this to be a lame excuse. This is now on the back burner with me but there is still something nagging in my brain. This also caused strife between MW and myself because I mentioned it to her. In her mind neither of her children has ever done anything wrong and are near perfect. If I so much as mention anything negative about her children she immediately brings up issues with my children.

3- Room air conditioning being run in mid December. I could hear their portable ac unit running one afternoon when nobody of course was in the room. The outside air temperature was 58 degrees. So I confronted them about it telling them that if they are hot it is the winter time and all they have to do is open their bedroom window. K said it wasn’t ac but only the fan. I had gone in to check and it was the AC. I said if you want a fan use the ceiling fan which is much more effective than the fan on an ac unit. There was no yelling or arguing during this discussion. A week later I found the unit running again and it wasn’t the fan it was the AC. I didn’t say anything but my stress level went up slightly.

4- On January 8th, a Friday, I knew E had gone into work and when I came in from the garage I noticed the room lights on underneath the closed bedroom door and I thought E had left them on. So I opened the door to turn the lights out. I found K sitting on the bed talking on the phone so I just waved and left the room closing the door behind me. I didn’t say a word because she was talking on the phone. That evening MW came to see me in the office and started complaining that I had upset K when I walked in on her. MW overheard K talking to E. K felt that I was stalking her trying to find something else to complain about to add to the above list of 3 items.

Two days later on Sunday afternoon, I approached her concerning this. I told her that I was not stalking her and that I didn’t know she was in E bedroom (nobody told me that she uses his room sometimes) and that I thought E had left his lights on and that I entered the room to shut the lights. She did not accept my explanation and insisted that I was stalking her and that I should have knocked before opening the door. I said why would I knock, I didn’t expect anybody to be in the room. She continued to not accept my explanation, would not listen to reason, and I got very upset, raised my voice and yelled at her that she now had me pissed off at her. I left the room after this and went up to the office. An hour later I knocked on her bedroom door and offered an apology and she responded I don’t want to talk now.  Since then I make every effort to avoid her and boy toy all day long and I refuse to have dinner because they are there.

MW only lays blame for the stressful situation on me and wants me to get counseling for anger issues. That’s why I’m here. I told her in the first week after they arrived at my house that having M here was causing me to have some depression.

5- I found the shower glass door being left open many times, it points straight out toward the entry door and is right in front of the toilet. Without any arguing or fighting I mentioned this to both of them. This is a safety issue because I use this bathroom for the toilet and may go into it 3 or more times a night. I explained to them that I am sometimes half asleep when I go and there is a possibility that I could walk into the door at night and get hurt. Since mentioning this to them I have found the shower door opened 2 times. I just close it and haven’t said another word.

6- Today, last night, 1/18, I found the bathroom door closed, nobody in it but the door was locked. I found the same thing again around 2 in the afternoon. This is crazy, why is someone locking the bathroom door and then closing it locked without being in there. I asked K if she was doing this and she said no that it was probably M. I knocked on his door and when he opened it I asked him why are you locking the bathroom door when you are not in there. He said because he was going to use it. I said when were you going to use it, so you are preventing others from using it. I said there is a downstairs bathroom that he can use if the upstairs one is occupied. He then bitched that I could use the bathroom in the master suite which is true for the daytime but not at night. He refused to admit that what he was doing was wrong, made no sense and was stupid. He is arrogant and argumentative. What he should have said is I’m sorry it won’t happen again. He was getting told about this by the owner of the house. I got hot and raised my voice. MW got between us to stop the confrontation and I went to my office. MW is now threatening me with a divorce because I can’t control my anger.

THOUGHTS: I’M WONDERING IF HE IS DOING THIS STUFF INTENTIONALLY TO GET ME RILED. THIS BATHROOM DOOR LOCKING IS INSANE.

For the last 3.5 months I’ve felt like a hostage in my own house. I stay in my office avoiding everyone except MW. Right now I am looking for an apartment to move to. Eventually K &amp; M will get jobs and move back to LA or wherever.

I (21m) have a girlfriend named Anna (21f) who comes from a very rich family while I came from a middle class family and while i did grow up with a lot of privileges none of them were in the same level as her's.


Anna grew up in a home where house staff, nannies and body guards were common place and while she's a very nice and down to earth person she always had a very sheltered reality. For exemple, she's the kind of person who has a savings account, doesn't eat out every day and regularly donates to charity but thinks that apple products are perfect gifts for whenever she doesn't know what to get someone.


 A few days back we were talking about holidays and i asked her how she spent mother's day, since her Mother died when she was a baby and her father never remarried. She just said that the only unsual thing she did on mother's day was that she visited her mom's grave in the morning with her father. I got confused by that then i asked her how she spent the rest of the day and she mentioned that growing up she would make cards and give them to the Nannies and they would spend the day playing and eating the sweets she asked her father to order.


I just kinda laughed at that point and she asked me what i was laughing about, then i told her ""You know the Nannies were just doing their jobs, right"" she got annoyed and told me that she knew but they raised and loved and the least she could do was to give them their due.


Annnd that where i think i might be the asshole, after she told me that i joked ""Yeah, i bet the fat paycheck certainly helped them to love you."" because when i said that she got quiet, grabbed her things and left.


Since them she's been cold towards me and told me she's rethinking our relationship but i really think she's overreacting.


What do you guys think, am i the asshole?.



Edit: So, after i posted my post and saw how it blew up with everyone ripping me into a new one i was still skeptical but then after i read some comments doing a breakdown of my post and pointing out how bad was the shit i said i started to think that maybe i was in the wrong.


Then i started receiving messages from many actual incels saying that they agree with me, after those messages i saw that yeah, i'm an asshole


I went and apologized to my girlfriend. Told her i was being an ignorant, spitful, malicious dumbass (Quoted some of you guys lol) and that i want her to know that what i said was bullshit and that even if she never forgave she should know that i was just being a jerk for the heck of it and she did nothing wrong.


She told me she knew that i was speaking out of my ass and forgave for what i said, but decided to dump me anyway. If things go well we'll still be friends if not at the least we're parting ways amicably.


She'll be fine, said she'll go and spend time with her father back at home for a while. I decided to stay single until i sorted out my own issues and that's it.


Believe it or not but i read every single reply and saw how wrong i was about nannies and by default all care workers, i won't justify what i said because i think it would be a cheap attemp to erase that i was a grade-A cunt, but i will apologize anyway.


Sorry for being an ignorant, dismissive, dehumanizing, classistic jerk who dismissed the emotional aspect of these type of jobs. No one has to forgive but i want to apologize anyway.

I'm going to address this in therapy this week, but curious on real-world opinions too. 

To preface, I believe I'm an above average looking guy (per other people). I make 120k, lots of hobbies etc. I'm 29 years old. I had one serious relationship from 21 to 26, girlfriend asked me out. I would rate her a solid 8-9. I have high standards, and I expect others to have high standards from me. I'm *really great at opening and meeting new people, I can talk to absolutely anybody, and rarely get turned down on dates.* My problem is that I don't know where to go from there. I have a nice history of abandonment (childhood), and was a nerdy outcast all my life, and never really became a solid catch or sure of myself until after college. I was never appreciated as a child, and have put up some serious walls to the point where I remain at a distance until I have somebody's **full** trust, I cannot help this. I don't trust anybody, even when I force myself to open and be vulnerable I'm pretty indecisive because I'm so used to my opinion being worthless. I've always gone against the grain in life, meaning nobody has ever approved of my decisions - however they got me where I am and I'm pretty successful for my age so I have this deep rooted belief that I can just go about my business and remain closed off to other people. 

This often leads to me just not telling people the whole truth, or not trusting them with my true feelings, likes/dislikes and just remaining distant.. 

sooooooooooooo

I've been getting close with this girl from work (i'm fine with it, don't care about the work thing), she was in a long-distance relationship when we met (october 2020), but we went to lunch a couple times, then had a dinner 'date' and she came over after, but we just talked work. Last weekend we went away skiing with friends and her and i spent most of our time together. She seemed into me enough to warrant a date, so thursday I asked her to dinner with me this weekend. This AM i confirmed saying ""7pm tonight still good?"" and she replies letting me know she invited a mutual friend along and that we should all go for a walk together before dinner. I politely declined the walk (i had plans at that time) and suggested that she just do the walk/dinner with our mutual friend instead. They went for the walk, then she called me and asked if I wanted to get dinner with just her, i gave in and we went out. 

We had a really great time, I attempted to pay, but she then venmo'd me (i didn't ask). After dinner she suggested we go get dessert, so we walked around and found an ice cream place. No indoor seating so I suggested we get it to-go and go back to my place and watch TV. She got super awkward and made up some very obviously fake excuse not to, so we ate it in the car. Then when she was dropping me off she parked the car, grabbed her bag and decided to come up. In my place we started watching TV, but she never took her coat off and sat on the opposite side of the couch. I asked if she was cold and wanted to take her coat off and she said ""I like wearing my coat indoors"" - odd. Then about 15 minutes later she said ""This was fun, I'm going to head out"". I walk her downstairs and she goes straight to her car, without even a hug..... 

So, i share this story with two friends. Female friends says ""F her, move on"", male friend says ""She didn't know it was a date"". My take is that she did know because she got weird about every stage of it, but wasn't comfortable for some reason. 

**This same exact scenario has happened to me at least 5 times in the past 3 years with girls i'm serious about** and I think it's probably partly them, but something that I'm doing wrong. My boss tells me i need to be more assertive, clear and decisive - is this a similar thing here - and if so, how? 

I guess if you're a woman - what gives? What do guys act like when you are in odd date situations like this? Men?

I have vacation and medical time I could take but part of the issue is that New York has a mandatory quarantine of 10 days for anyone that leaves the state.

I know that last bit is selfish, but I recently moved to NY and left everyone I know back in ID. So my mental health has been suffering in my loneliness and I was planning on using travel later in the year to see a lot of friends (with my job there's a good chance I'll have a vaccine by May). Another thing is, I don't know how I feel about all my family rushing to see my grandpa in the first place. A lot of people are traveling to see him and I'm worried about us spreading covid to one another. 
For some more context, my friends are more in my age range, not high risk, a lot of my family is older or not super healthy, high risk.
I want to go see him, and if it weren't for the pandemic I would. I'm not 100% sure how much of my hesitation is not wanting to spread covid and how much is being selfish about my time off.

I had a mishap with a bottle of nail polish remover in my purse and so my debit card, while still active, can't be used in the physical world and can only have the number on it be used, the magnetic strip melted. We wanted to buy our laptops at Costco and we didn't know if they had apple pay so I sent the $1200 to my boyfriend's account through Venmo so that we could use his debit card. We were both aware that this money is still mine and it was out of convenience only.

Long story short, we get his computer in the store but they didn't have the one that I wanted so I decided to order it off of the website, I apple cashed the money leftover from buying his laptop back to me so that I could buy mine off my card ($400).

It turns out his Venmo and apple cash are attached to two different accounts so it overdraft one of his accounts. (it's important to note that he only had $48 altogether of his own money) well, he kept spending money out of the account that had the $400 in it still and ended up spending $250 before he realized that his other account was overdrawn. When he told me I told him to just move the money over and he told me he didn't have enough to bring the account to zero.

I basically told him tough luck and that he shouldn't have spent money that wasn't his. He knew that I was taking my money back and I wasn't going to give him another $200 on top of the $800 that I already spent on his laptop just because he is irresponsible with his money.

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel like I might be wrong because I'm the one who pulled the money out of his account in the first place, but at the end of the day, that extra $200 he spent wasn't his money to spend and I feel like he needs to figure this one out himself. AITA

EDIT: So I didn’t explain it very well, but he has two bank accounts. One is attached to Venmo and the other is attached to Apple Pay. The $400 was in the account attached to Venmo but I pulled it out of the account attached to Apple Pay which already had a balance of zero. So the Apple Pay account went -$400 while the Venmo account had $462. (I was just gonna let him keep the extra $14) if he had just moved the money from the Venmo account into the Apple Pay account then his Apple Pay account would have been +$62 and his Venmo account would be at zero, but instead he spent more than half of the money in the Venmo account and now doesn’t have enough to bring the account back up to zero.",0,0,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,self,AITA for taking my money back from my boyfriend's account?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/kwnvyo/aita_for_taking_my_money_back_from_my_boyfriends/,all_ads,116.5

So yesterday I had to serve at a restaurant for about 6 hellish hours of nonstop running around, and my girlfriend had planned to come in and give me a kiss around New Years after her and her best friend ate, which we did. Afterwards (around 1am) she had planned to go out to a bar or block party to enjoy the rest of the evening. On the way back from  the restaurant (I walked, it’s only a short distance and she drove.) I told her I didn’t want to go out, and she had started yelling at me how it’s her favorite holiday and how I ruined it by not following through with our plan, and when we got back to our apartment I told her I was willing to compromise after I had eaten something, and she still wasn’t having it.

When we got to the apartment we had a huge fight where we called each other everything bad in the book, while she was drunk, she managed to flip a table and throw chairs around, and even push me around physically, and I kept telling her that I was still willing to go out to salvage this, and she kept saying no, I ruined it completely, that I’m selfish, and that I’m a complete psychopath who gaslights her at every turn.

I love her more than anything, but she kept telling me she doesn’t love me anymore after what I did today, and I can’t understand where I went wrong.

TLDR: Didn’t follow through with NYE plans, got into huge fight with gf, don’t know where I went wrong.

So the other day I was hanging with my girlfriend at her apartment. Her roommate happened to be in the room and mentioned something about my girlfriend’s YouTube channel. I was immediately confused because I’d never heard of it before.

Later that night I brought it up to my girlfriend and she said it was just something she does for a little extra cash. She apparently has about 100k subscribers.

I was kinda thrown for a loop as I’d never heard of this before. So I asked her what kind of content she makes and she said something vague about how it was cringe and stuff. I tried to get her channel name but she refused to tell me the channel name. By this time I was kinda upset that it kinda felt like she had been hiding this from me.

So the next morning I got up and went to the kitchen and her two roommates happened to be there. I started talking to them and asked a bit about the YouTube channel, they both knew about it but refused to tell me the channel name, saying that my girlfriend had specifically asked them not to tell me.

By this time I was pretty upset. It really felt like my girlfriend had been hiding this from me on purpose and that’s also to add to the fact that I have no clue what she even does on YouTube.

He has a mental illness and refuses to get help. I understand its hard- lives with his parents and his illness involves taboo sexual thoughts and occasional violence or sexist/racist ones.

We started talking and got a long fairly well. We would talk about anime, games, stuff we had in common in general. I added her to a group chat with my best friend (15F) from 2nd grade who I will call R. R recently got into a relationship with A's friend. And kind of butted heads with A but nonetheless we all got a long pretty well. It all started when my now ex friend (15F) M started talking to A and got a long super well. Like, they were in a relationship for a while, they were very close. So one time me and R and M were all chatting till A started saying ""I don't care"" and ""stop talking."" We didn't do anything to provoke her and if it really upset her she could've just left. Nonetheless I asked her if she was alright and it ended up becoming an argument. M got in the middle of it and was defending A. She was saying stuff like ""Shes just in a bad mood."" and ""Leave her alone"".  Me and R told A that if we really bothered her than she could leave. So A eventually did leave. Fast forward a week or so and R sent me a conversation between her and A. A was trying to accuse R of cheating on her boyfriend (14M) S. I got extremely pissed and I am naturally a very loyal and defensive person over the people I love. R hesitated to call A out so I confronted A on the conversation. A kept deflecting my points, gas lighting me, and manipulate M into defending her. A kind of gave up and straight up told me that her ""Plan was working"" And basically tried to make it seem like I could not stop her from breaking R and S up. A even telling R that if they break up A is gonna get with S and S doesn't even like A. At all. Fast forward  to when the drama dies down. me and M are no longer friends because of other drama and R is back to talking to A. Whenever R brings up A I try to tell her to stop talking to A. R is very gullible compared to me and easily accepts people's half ass apologies. (A has ""apologised"" To R multiple times just to manipulate and gaslight her again and again.) I kept trying to give advice to R like: A isn't sorry. Shes just using you. R says shes just pretending to be friends with A. I keep telling her its not even worth pretending to be friends with her. Now R sent me a conversation between her and A. I will quote it word for word.

R: Did you really just ask that? If I didn't care about him and love him, (referring to her boyfriend) I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN WITH HIM FOR 4 MONTHS. I don't play with people I actually love and care about.

A: haha, or do I?

R: Oh yea?

A: People can play games.

R: What do you know?

A: I know he is too nice for someone like you. (May I note R is litterally the nicest person I know.)

R: Like me?

A: I also know you are just someone who can not figure out at times. Do you really and truly love him?

R: Of course I do, if I didn't I wouldn't be with him right now and I wouldn't have even started dating him. You know nothing about our relationship, you can assume. I hate you.

A: I know nothing? woah way to say that to someone who is A YEAR AHEAD OF YOU AND A YEAR OLDER THAN YOU DUMBASS. Tbh, I hated you since, the first time I met you... You're right though maybe... I was trying to steal S away from you. Then again, I wasn't, why would I? ( ah, gaslighting at its finest)

My wife and I have a 3 year old girl. Sometimes she picks out her clothes and sometimes she wants one of us to.

I physically could not care any less that my toddler’s clothes follow the pattern deemed by a random fashion mogul as “matching” and the three year old has no problem with it. 

My wife thinks I am being lazy and should train my child to match clothes. AITA?

Edit: seems like it might be important to add that we have a 4 month old as well and he is held the majority of the time right now so if one of us is busy and the other is taking care of both of them, it’s not so simple to go through clothes to pick stuff out

So I (27F) work in an office type environment. I have been there a few years as has the coworker (C) in question (30F). When I started working there I was about 50 lbs overweight, now I'm about 15 lbs overweight. C is very obese and has remained about the same weight from when she started working.

C almost exclusively eats food that is incredibly unhealthy. Jimmy Deans sandwiches/bowl things everyday, fast food, things like that. I have never really seen her eat anything healthy except a banana sometimes. She's also one of the less active workers, she will avoid any physical activity she can like lifting heavy boxes or things like that. She always finds someone else to do it for her. Shes even told me that she can do them, and that she just doesn't want to atm.

C likes to make ""jokes"" about her weight. If someone mentions anything about weight loss or working out she'll say something along the lines of ""oh I wish I could lose weight, I'm only like this because of my thyroid!"" every single time. She does probably have a thyroid problem, and I understand that definitely contributes to weight. She's always making awkward jokes about being fat and always relates it to her thyroid. She has never once made a ""joke"" about her weight that didn't end as ""my darn thyroid"" or ""if only my thyroid didn't mess me up like this"", etc.

One day I was talking to someone else entirely about how I had been working out from home since the pandemic started and how I'm doing things like using cans of beans as weights. He mentioned that I definitely looked smaller than when I first started. C was sitting not that far from us and said very loudly ""be lucky you're not in my position, or you'd never lose anything!"" so I said ""oh please C, I've seen what you eat"". She was visibly angry and said I had no idea what I was talking about, that it's nearly impossible to be fit when you have a thyroid problem, and that she doesn't choose to have it. I said her thyroid isn't buying Mcdonalds several times a week or eating all those jimmy deans. I then said that maybe if she wasn't lazy she wouldn't be where she was. She left, I heard from someone else she was crying afterwards. It made me feel bad that she was crying, but I don't really feel bad about what I said. Another coworker said I was fat shaming her, and I told them it's not like I'm exactly miss slim n trim over here. Plus, I literally don't care about her weight. I care more that, because of her weight and general laziness, she refuses to put in the same work and effort everyone else does around the office. Plus its annoying to hear her complain about constantly. Also neither of us were speaking to her! The coworker I was first speaking to told me not to worry about it and that I was NTA.

And as for singing, well, my parents hated it and said I sung worse that anything they’d ever heard so I wasn’t really keen on continuing. But my music teachers said I sung well, and I was even in my school choir.

Anyway, at one point I had decided that I wanted to try to become a singer, and kind of do what I liked. I knew that it was hard and that many people fail, but I wanted to at least give it a try. My mum found out and got really mad, and also said that if I did that, she wouldn’t be there for me. I didn’t want to break the relationship with my parents so I put my dream to the side and concentrated on doing what they wanted, aka getting good grades and getting into a good university.

And that’s where I’m now. It’s my 3rd year, and even if I do like my studies, my dream is still there in the background. And it’s kinda getting more and more prominent, instead of just being “something that I would have liked but it’s okay if I didn’t do it” thing. And I feel a bit as if I’m just doing what my parents want me to do. I don’t even really know what type of career I’d like to do with my studies, because the only one I kinda thought of, I got told by teachers and my parents that “it’s stupid, you won’t live well, don’t do that”.

I found out about possibilities to get dance and vocal classes online, and then the possibility to audition to different companies, and I’m really interested. But it’s expensive (for a student at least), and I’m afraid of my parents’ reactions if they find out, particularly my mum’s...

I understand my parents’ worries, but I’m tired of just doing what I’m expected to do, what they want. And I don’t want to lose hem either, but at the same time I’d like to do something linked to my dreams.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday...

I get a text from him asking if I can make some DVDs for him. I ask when he'd need it by, my health hasn't been the best as of late (doing good today though) and he said preferable today. I pony up my laptop and go over. 

He had me come over to copy an Pistol Permit Dvd, he's an instructor,  the thing is protected, so I had to download a program to do that. He kept getting into my bubble, and looking over my shoulder when I was on like my fb and discord and kept asking how it was doing after the fact I said to him it was doing the same thing.   

So at the last second the darn program glitched, so I had to redo it. Then after that he wanted me to put it on a blank CD. His wife woke up and I had food to eat and I didn't want to eat in front of them. For some damn reason I am self conscious about stuff like that. I'm waiting for the DVD to finish and again he's over my shoulder and in my bubble. I wanted to tell him to back off, but wasn't gonna be rude. His wife was getting pissed at him cause she can tell I was getting upset. They got into a spat about me, she wanted him to let me go and he told her to shut up. (Keep in mind these two around their 80's).  

He had me put the clips on his usb. Cool, he still wanted me to do the DVD, I said it can take hours. So I said to him, since you have a google account, let me put it on your google drive so then you can give the link to more than one person and they can download and access whenever. He's like ""but put it on the dvd so he can watch whenever."" And that's when I lost it. 

I turn to him and say sharply ""You're not listening to me!"" I reiterated what I said. I went to his laptop and I put it on his drive.   Later I'm at home and he's like ""Did you still do the DVD?"" and I said ""No, I couldn't do it anyways because I need a new battery on this laptop. So the data would be incomplete because of that.""  

I wasted four freaking hours! Before anyone asks why I didn't charge him, it was so last second I didn't think about it.

   I feel torn because I know it’s hard for him and it’s allegedly one shot he took, but he knows he could have come to me so I can be a sort of sponsor for him. I feel hurt and I don’t know what to do because I’m pretty sure he’s going to continue hiding it from me. 

   He’s done some pretty abusive stuff to me while under the influence of alcohol which I won’t go into detail, but my therapist told me I have PTSD from my alcoholic father who was very abusive to my mother. I’ve explained this to him and that I can’t control my emotions or anxiety when he drinks because I just kind of panic and get flashbacks of the abuse.

   When he confessed that he drank he didn’t apologize, he just gave excuses and said that because of me he has to live in fear of me leaving him, but since we have a 2 year old together, I finally put my foot down a month ago when he was the worst he ever was and gave him the ultimatum.

I’d never thought that I would be writing this . First of all, I would appreciate advice from a perspective of working through the issue, providing a judgmental character assassination would not be helpful.
Here is some of the backstory

I’m in the 2nd year of my 2nd marriage, we met online 4 years ago, we lived in the same town and crossed paths from time to time. 

When we met, it seemed we were both just looking for a companion and some easy conversation. I had been married before for 22 years , I  have two grown (20 &amp; 25) children and they do not cause any difficulties in our current status; she had been married for 7 years had twins and she also had a relationship after her divorce that gave her another child.
The father of the twins is involved in the kids lives and the father of the 3rd child is at best a quarterly visitor. 

Still I love these children and try to be a good stepdad. Especially for the 3rd child as they have been unfairly left without a fatherly influence.

During our dating phase my wife took her time in introducing the children to me, and we began to develop a more significant relationship, but also during this time she and I broke up twice because she thought (nothing I said) I wouldn’t be interested in starting over family wise. I pushed forward explaining that these thoughts were in her head and that I fully understood the depth and breadth of what it meant to live her and have a relationship, I took the seriousness of the children to heart. When I finally got to meet them, it went well. I began spending more and more nights at her home and eventually we moved in together. That was a tough adjustment as for half the week we had 2 adults and 3 young children in a 2 bedroom townhouse.
Crowded loud , messy and absolutely no privacy. 

I work from home so I was in the habit of taking important phone calls on the back patio. I truly felt that I was doing the best to ease life for my girlfriend.
After a year of living together, I offered her more money so we could find a bigger place. She agreed and we moved to a different unit. We now had 3 bedrooms instead of 2 and the rest was the same. 
As time went by we quickly grew into this place as well and decided that after our lease would run out we would look to buy something. 

Our relationship was fairly smooth from my perspective, but my girlfriend thought that I was in it for her but she still thought that I wouldn’t be in it for the children.

I have to add some background that I constantly think about; her mom divorced her father when she was in her young teens (to be with another woman) , her baby daddy abandoned the 3rd child. 
Was all of this internal drama arising from those issues? 

Well life goes on and one day she comes home and says “ I bought a house today”
Will you come see it. I went and the property was great , the house needed to be gutted. She asked, if I would come live with them( I still had my own place ) and I said yes, we discussed the future, getting married , building a life and I was ready to commit.

She made the minimal down payment and I pledge to gut the house and add a bathroom. I invested 50k for this effort. 
2 months later we moved in and I bought the “ring”.

Drama 🎭 starts one month into living in the house, she says to me that I don’t see myself married to you 5 years from now, I dismiss these statements and say you are just sabotaging your life again and maybe you should have faith in our love and relationship. She says that we should go back to living apart and gives me back the ring . I inform her that I will not be leaving the house until I get my $$ back as she shouldn’t be unjustly enriched. On a purely business view my 50k raised the value of the house 140k . Which I knew it would.
These drama went on for over 2 months. 
Until one day child 3 was playing near our koi pond and fell in, I immediately jumped in and saved her. 
The next day she said, that she wanted to work on us . She began to communicate more and said she wanted to work on us. Four months later , I told her I loved her and that if she didn’t want to commit to me and marry me, she should just let me go (I still wanted my $$). Don’t think I’m being $$ oriented, but I gave my all without leaving anything for me to take care of myself. I was and still at the moment committed for life.  She asked for the ring back several weeks later and we got married at City Hall. 2 great things, I felt we were over the hump and I now had legal rights to my home.

Covid hits and we are back to always being on top of one another . I spent the time on solidifying my business, cleaning up my debt. Refurbishing the house and we refinanced the mortgage. We were in gliding mode. Turn the house into a home and the backyard in a wonderful oasis. The house is now worth 200k more than we bought it for.

Of course we argue from time to time, but honestly, I don’t fret much as being 10 years older and already raised kids , I seem to take things in stride and live in the present. 
She came to me 3 weeks ago and said, I love you but I have doubts; is this hormonal changes (premenopausal), ongoing psychological issues, I’m lost.
She says she wants to go to counseling, I said great. We had our first session.

I guess what I’m trying to figure out is what, how and when.

I love her and the kids. I live my home. Although my needs are not being met at this time, I do realize that this is a moment and not the whole story; I am probably the most grounded, empathetic and patient that I have ever been in my life.

I know the easy thing is “end it” force the sale of the house and move on.
I am willing to work, I hope she is? 
This past flare up has dissipated a little, but I am sure it will take time .

How long do I let this process work out?
Does anyone have any experience or thoughts. I am trying to work on me and improving myself. I’m just sad.",0,0,relationship_advice,t5_2r0cn,self,Married &amp; Struggling,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/kv28ll/married_struggling/,all_ads,13.0

He didn’t plan on acting on it. He just had to tell me. I was fine with it to a degree but then he wouldn’t stop obsessing about it, talking about it, he just wouldn’t stop.
He ended up having an emotional affair with a transwoman. And then ended it when I asked him to, but then resumed, of course. Then he wanted to do sexual things that I was comfortable engaging in (butt-play, dildos). I was fine with him using that as solo time, I just didn’t want to participate in it. I have personal sexual boundaries due to my experiences in life. I thought he respected that but then he called me sexually limited telling me that he will just be unfulfilled sexually. Then I was called controlling, narcissistic, hateful, bigoted, close-minded. I ended up having sex with a friend just to somehow get through this. It worked. It woke me up to the fact that I wasn’t any of the things he said I was. That I’m not broken in the sex area, we were just in a place of incompatibility. Or so I thought. 
We talked about opening our marriage to give him space to explore since I was unwilling to. He ended up in a whole other relationship with someone else. 
When I told him I was done with our marriage, he blamed porn, his therapist, the transwoman, and told me that he was manipulated to believe these things. Porn has been a recurring issues in our marriage, its damaging to our relationship because he gets obsessed with it and then tries to incorporate into our sex life to uncomfortable degree for me. When the trans stuff started, he suggested I wear more colorful makeup like them, that hurt me deeply. 
Now he says that he wants me, loves me, wants to reconcile, will drop it all if I want to work on our marriage. He's still seeing his gf and hes angry with me all the time. 
I am in a place where I no longer want our marriage, I fantasize about a life where I am no longer married and just care for myself and my children, I never want to integrate my life and attach my self worth to another person. I dont want this anymore. We can survive separately. But I feel bad about it all. About not wanting to work on it, about him and what life looks like for the 4 of us after separation. He says he doesn’t see himself being around much for the kids if we separate. I cant look at him the same anymore. 
 I could stay with him for the kids and for him. But I don’t want that. I feel lost. I love him but I am no longer in love with him. I wish we could remain friends and parent together, but he is so angry with me. I feel lots of conflicting emotions.

Any wise words are appreciated.

To give this argument some context, my (24 F) mom (57 F) has a very, very long history of being rude, passive-aggressive, and emotionally manipulative, especially when she's emotional about something. For my entire life, I've had to put up with the shouting and emotional manipulation during arguments, and then getting yelled at and gaslit even more if I tried to stand up for myself. She's one of those people who can be really rude and passive-aggressive to service workers, and that attitude sometimes bleeds into how she talks to S and I when she wants something.

As an example of an argument she's caused, one time, my younger sister (S, 20F now, 12 at the time) was watching TV, and my mom came in and started yelling at her to get out so that she could watch TV. I tried standing up for S, but my mom continued on her tirade until S left the room in tears. My mom never apologized, and sat down to watch the news.

This brings me to today. I came downstairs to help my mom with cleaning out the oven, but the oven was too hot, so I went to make myself lunch while I waited for the oven to cool down. I made a little salad in a bowl, and my mom piped in from the other room, very passive-aggressively asking me why I hadn't made a salad for everyone. The honest answer is that I just didn't think to. Sometimes I do make enough for everyone, but today, my mind was elsewhere.

The conversation was interrupted by a phone call for me, so I answered the phone, finished talking to the caller, and went back to the counter to bring my salad to the table. My mom said, very sarcastically, ""thank you SO much for making a salad for everyone.""

Fed up, I apologized for not thinking of making a salad for everyone, and told my mom that she didn't have to be so rude and passive-aggressive. I got out a big bowl, made a giant salad, got a plate and some cutlery, and put it all down on the table in front of my mom. My frustration and annoyance got to me, so I ended up using a little bit more force than I would have otherwise.

My parents exploded at me, yelling about how I was being rude and aggressive, and it devolved into a whole argument with my parents focusing on the way I put the food on the table and not at all about my mom and her behavior, and how she didn't apologize to me for being rude or acknowledge how rude she was being. I did acknowledge that the way I put the salad and plate down on the table was too much.

I was so  frustrated from the whole situation and from being spoken over, I gave up and walked away. As I did, I told her that I'm sick of trying to explain to her her how to not be rude and entitled when she wants something, and that it shouldn't be my job to do so.

I love my mom to death, she's amazing, but this pattern of behavior absolutely drives me up the wall.

Everybody tell us that interviewers can judge a candidate in 20 seconds. Well, that's all they do , they judge. They don't listen, they listen and see just to judge. 
Grading candidates on the basis of body language and clothes and their ability to speak is A grade shit. Before you write in the comments that OP has been rejected or he feels insecure, no I don't but I feel bad that we are supposed to act like someone we are not in an interview. 
To give you a perspective ,I will write a sentence verbatim that I read somewhere about interviews on what a candidate should do.

*A candidate must keep a distance of 8cm between their legs while they sit* 

These are the kind of things that made me angry. Instead of judging them on the basis of these kinds of shit, judge people on the basis of their ideas, their knowledge, their personality, their merit and LISTEN to what they speak and their determination.

 Yes I get there are some interviews where body language may be judged to determine a candidate a fit or not i.e stress based interviews and they are important in the case of manufacturing or stressful jobs.

And yes sometimes people have to be judged on the basis of their ability to speak for jobs like sales etc.

I ruined our friendship because of my depression. She was always there for me and we had our fun times, but tbh it always took me too much energy to be around her. She is the type of girl who constantly needs attention and goes kinda mad when you don't text or talk to her for a few days. She sort of claimed me as her bff. I didn't felt like she was my bff, because I was always reluctant to hangout with her and I never really told her that because I didn't wanted to hurt her feelings. 

Because of my depression I isolated myself from everyone for a bit, I really felt like a burden and didn't had the energy to socialize with people. So a few weeks ago, my friend and I got in a fight. She was mad about how bad I treated her after all the things she had done for me. And that I was being selfish by not showing intrest in her anymore in the past six months, like I used to. Because of that she told me she doesn't want to be friends with me anymore, if i keep acting like that. Also she told me if I still wanted to be her friend, that I need to have a good explanation about my behavior and need to apologize to her.

I didn't knew what to say, so I took the blame of being the bad friend and agreed that we shouldn't be friends anymore. And tbh I'm glad I did! I just didn't had the energy to own her an explanation. After that she snapped at me and said really mean things. 

Today, a few weeks after that convo she deleted me out of every ""friend group"" and I suspect that she talks bad about me to them. (I'm not really close to the others, so I don't even want to bother to ask them.) 

She still hasn't unfriend me on ig, fb and snapchat. As i'm typing this, I realize it's even a stupid question to ask, if I should unfriend her on social media.

I'm going to give a bit of background to myself as I feel it is relevant as to why I'm apprehensive to label someone an addict. 

As a child, I witnessed both of my parents drink very heavily. For my father, one or two beers after work every day was the norm. It ""just helps dad relax"". There was always at least two full cases of beer in the fridge at any time. Dad would be asleep by 7pm on Friday/Saturday nights because he would up his consumption.

For my mother (single parent), she would drink 5+ beers every second night. There was always at least. Case of beer in the fridge. As with my father, every Friday and Saturday she was asleep after drinking. 

Now, I was lead to believe this is normal alcohol consumption. To this day, I am still confused as I feel like I'm overeating. My friends parents never drank like this but because we are a blue collar/ low socioeconomic family I was told ""this is how we have fun""

Fast forward to a few years ago. When my husband and I started dating, we were both relatively young and in university. My husband studied music performance and I studied theatre. As such, it was stupidly common for everyone to either have an entire personality that was based on alcohol consumption or weed. 

Well, husband used to be an every day smoker. He smoked before dates, he smoked before meals, he smoked before sex, he smoked after sex. He was pretty much stoned at every point of the day. I was under the impression that that's just how people relaxed. Well, I put up with this for about 4.5 years until I got to breaking point. It went from being something we did in uni to his entire life. I gave him an ultimatum, stop smoking weed or be single. He actually stopped smoking weed which was amazing. 

A few months went by and my husband's friends were getting into craft beer. At the time, it was relatively new. So my husband is given a few cans of nice expensive beer and enjoyed them.

So, a beer every couple nights? That's ok. 

A beer every couple of nights went from a beer every night. He's just relaxing after work like dad? That's what dad did after work every night. This is normal right?

One beer every night after work turned into two beers. Then sometimes 3. 

Friday nights became more beers. And then Saturday nights. And Sunday during the day. And Sunday evening. 

Now, it's not uncommon on Friday or Saturday nights for him to drink until he's pretty drunk. At least once every two weeks he will drink to the point where he is vomitting the next morning. Every weekend he is out of action for at least one full day because he is sleeping it off. 

However. I feel like I'm going crazy? This seems to be such a common thing for people? Everyone of his friends does the same thing. Am I overeating? My parents did this too. This is ""living"" and I've always been a wet blanket in their eyes.

For example: When she was 12 she was partnered with a girl in her class who had learning disabilities. She was complaining to her friends that she was doing most of the work and it took forever to get through to her partner. The girl had a sister who was in the same grade as me and she started bullying my sister to get back at her. She then comes crying to me and asks me to stop her, asking me to fight the girl literally and all kinds of stuff. I told her to be less mean in the future and I would take care of it. So I told an adult. Then when my sister got in trouble for how she talked about her partner my sister wanted me to get her out of trouble by lying for her. I refused.

A while after that a girl in her English class planned a trip for them all but didn't invite my sister because she excluded her from stuff before. My sister got really upset and wanted me to get the girls brother to invite my sister.

Another time just after she started high school she pissed off the lunch lady and she wanted me to smooth that over.

Then there was the time she told me that a boy called her a \*\*\*\* and that he was mocking her to his friends. I knew the guy and he told me she had lied about them sleeping together and that she could have gotten him into some serious shit and he never called her that but he did say she was a bitch for saying that. I told her not to say stuff like that. She denied it. But I'll be honest the way she is with people I believed him over her.

So this time she started college in September and her roommate applied to have her kicked out because she's been pissing her off. Nobody wants to room with my sister so she wanted me to help her out by letting her stay with me (she's in college in my town). I told her no and that I'm tired of her coming to me and she needs to learn how to treat people so she won't get into trouble.

The examples I posted are only a small few of the many times she has come to me after pissing someone off or treating someone like crap.

My parents think I should still help her though because we're sisters and she's never been bad to me.

Reading novels and other media is fine if you enjoy it, I have no qualms with anyone who reads for fun or their own self joy and doesn't spawn an ego from it. That's the issue however, it seems like educators and book nerds see themselves as higher than anything because they read novels for fun and practically spit on those who don't.

I don't understand? Why is your medium more valid than any of my entertainment mediums I have to offer? Reading in all honesty isn't that important of a life skill, a good desire for knowledge and a want to learn knew things you're interested in is. But there's other mediums to expand and explore that. I don't enjoy the text craw of a novel, it bores me quite frankly. Does it mean I'm uncreative? Because I adore art and find painting review and critique videos fascinating. Or is that I'm uneducated? Because I was just excepted into my first choice college and will be attending next fall. Or maybe because I just haven't found the ""right one."" Even though I have. I've actually been able one or two lengthy novels in the past that were rare exceptions to my usual disdain reading.

So why am I not allowed to not enjoy your medium without being preserved as lesser? What if it was reversed? What if everyone who enjoyed watching anime, painting, exercising, etc. scoffed every time you mentioned that you didn't enjoy it and thus saw you as a Neanderthal because of it. (not including the extremists in those categories who do) And then to go on and have an entire curriculum in education dedicated to that medium they forced onto you and graded you for not completing in time or the way they wanted. If the rolls were revered it would seem unfair.

Edit  I didn't provide enough context for reading not being a valuable life skill. What I meant to say was that reading for fun and just for novels won't make you excel in life where other's wont. A good understanding of text and literary emotion most certainly is. But just reading books for fun isn't necessarily.

I counted 8 first dates with different people since September. All the people were met online, since I’ve always had a lot of trouble meeting new people to date in person, and it’s not the best time to be approaching people anyway. 

What tends to happen is we match, start talking, seem to like each other, plan a date, sometimes even talk facetime before, go on said date and it goes amazingly. They often will end it by saying they wanna see me again, a few even planned when we would. But when I get home everything changes. 

They either become obviously distant, tell me they aren’t looking for a relationship right now (even though I never am the first to bring up the idea of a relationship), or just straight up ghost me. It hurts, though I usually manage well, but what happened today hit me way harder than normal. Reason being I got constant reassurance, we talked a lot on facetime and text and really clicked before we met up. she promised to drive over see me soon because she had something come up and the date had to get cut short, which genuinely wasn’t related to what happened after. 

A few hours after I got home, she sent a really short concise text about how she doesn’t wanna be in a relationship right now, and that she just didn’t feel a strong connection. This was the first time I was certain it was going well and would lead somewhere, so I spiraled very hard and don’t know how I’ll recover.

So what? I know how to use words like “whom,” so why is it so horrible if I use it? If you don’t know what “amalgamation” or “obfuscate” means, just don’t use it. I’ve been told not to use those words before, maybe two or three times. I just don’t get why.

I understand if someone’s quite obviously using words and phrases just to sound smart but it’s not working, that can be an issue.

It’s a word for a reason. There’s a definition to it. If the definition works for what I’m trying to say, why can’t I use it without being labeled “pretentious?”

Edit: I also wanted to add saying things like “the town in which I lived.” You’re not supposed to end sentences with prepositions. People get weird when I say stuff like that too. Obviously it’s not a huge deal unless you’re being hardcore graded, but still.

We met through friends, she’s good friends with my best friend’s girlfriend. For several years we’ve had a flirtatious vibe going on, I always found her to be attractive, smart, and funny. She knew how to playfully push my buttons and it maintained my interest in her. However she’d always been in a relationship, I respected her boundaries until one day she was single and we hooked up.

That was roughly three months ago since then things have been great, I enjoy hanging out with her, we’ve both introduced each other to new tv shows books hobbies, I’m able to be myself around her not many people see my dorkiness and what seems like to me she thoroughly enjoys it..
 
That is until last week when she hit me with the what are we talk. This was the first time we’d communicated about our relationship. Cue, my instant panic sweating and stumbling on my words which lead to me revealing that I saw her as FWB. She concluded that she had real feelings for me but if that was the way I saw out relationship it'd be best to go our separate ways. The next day to try to explain myself further I told her I cared deeply for her that I’d love to be in a relationship but I wasn't able to see a future with her. She understood where I was coming from and we parted ways.
 
My reasoning for my decision. We are at different stages in our lives I’ve been in a career for 3 years but in the process of job hunting and considering relocation as a real possibility. She’s beginning her career next month, which would require her to stay in our current location for the next year or so. I always thought and still do that the uncertainty of our future career paths would complicate things. Hence the reasoning why I considered her as a FWB. I also treated her as such during our relationship, inviting her over when I felt it convenient for me. It was until recently that I felt myself yearning to do more with her.  

For me it was easier to not have strings attached incase we go our separate ways. A reasonable explanation except for the fact that this girl at first glance is worth the effort, apart from the reasons mentioned already. She’s driven and has very ambitious goals in life, she’s kind hearted, considerate, and adventurous. Thinking back she’s shown me a level of affection I haven’t had from my previous relationships. Then retracing the what are we conversation hearing the disappointment in her voice I could tell she wanted to work things out through the uncertainty.

My ex (27f) ended things with me (36m) last month. We were long distance friends for several years before finally meeting up this past summer. I'm in TX and she's in FL so I flew there a few times over the summer/fall and she came here once to visit family in another city and to where I live for a few days as well. All in all it was wonderful and she's everything I've ever wanted in a partner.  She has the gentlest heart and is whip smart, she's incredibly talented and passionate about things, she's beautiful. I figured she was it, this was it. If this wasn't real what possibly could be?

Leading up to when we met last year, she also spent a lot of time telling me how awful her mom has been to her over the course of her life. Dependency issues, serious financial abuse, emotional abuse, using drugs in front of her when she was a child, the works. Needless to say it didn't paint a very positive picture of her in my mind. Ex also has severe anxiety issues and depression, so that also factors in. Her grandma (moms mom) passes away in late august (without a funeral) and then in October 2 days before she's supposed to fly to Texas to visit me and her family, her mom has some sort of issue in a city a few hours away from her and says she has to come stay with my ex (she lives with another family member so the house was already a bit crowded)  and wants her to cancel her trip to see me and her brother. She ends up still coming but that and the visit after that (which ended up being the last) had an odd shadow over them, like something was weighing her down (obviously). Our last visit was in November and we stayed at her place with her mom now living in the same house just outside her bedroom. It wasn't anything near the first few times we hung out, and she was anxious the whole time. It was like her light went out, the sparkle in her eye wasn't there anymore, her sweetness was gone. I recognized this and was patient and forgiving, always was, but when I got home we both knew something was different.

Over the next month into the middle of Dec it just went straight downhill. She disengaged almost completely, I had covid in the first week of Dec and I barely heard from her at all. Up until then we would talk every night. The downward trajectory correlated with her mom moving in and I can't get it out of my head that she has been in my ex's ear sewing God knows what kind of doubt about us into her head all along. We talked a lot all throughout 2020 of her maybe moving out here close to her oldest brother and his fiancé who she adores, we'd start a life together, we'd be happy. We both wanted the same long term relationship goals. She ended it in December because she says she needs time to think clearly, which I understand completely. We started a LDR in the middle of a global pandemic, there's gonna be doubt. But the way it was done throws me off. We've had arguments since then and I've lost my temper but it's never malicious, just angry, but she insists on portraying me as the bad guy. A man in a long line of men who have just happened to her, not *the man* she said she wanted to spend the rest of her life loving and falling for just a few months prior. There also may be another guy involved, our spotify's were still joined until a few days ago and I found some playlists she made with him with the title being their two cities' airport codes..

All in all I know I need to move on, because whatever is going on is probably beyond me and generally not about me. She says I was a great boyfriend and did everything right, but also she says she always felt ""beneath me"" while saying it was her fault for feeling that way.. Just a lot of confusion. I'm just lost, this is the hardest breakup I've ever gone through because of how hot it was and how fast it went cold and it's left me here blindsided and alone with my thoughts.

I’ve been dealing with this ex for about 1 and a half years and now she is gone. I cared about her a lot because we did have some good days and her family was great and we even got a pet together and I miss that pet so much but I know that what I did was for the better. 

A little of what she did was delete all my friends on my snap that were girls. Yell at me if I left her on read for any amount of time 2 seconds or longer. Demand that I come over at least 5-6 times a week (she lives about 30 minutes away) wouldn’t let me leave when my parents asked and would pout and cry and then say I’m such a child for listening to my parents. Call my house ghetto and then acting like a child if I didn’t order her any food because the food at my house was “ghetto”. Not caring about my feelings when I told her that I need some time to just be with my family because my parents split up just a couple weeks ago about 2 months ago from when I’m writing this. And that split up was very very messy. She would never comfort me she always expected me to be there for her and she would expect me to watch everything she wanted and nothing of what I wanted and just all that and much much more and she did at several times beat me with a belt and also forced me to have sex in a way. Too shy and just confused about my feelings to say anything. I froze up. 





So now she is gone but of course all the good times are coming back to me and I hate my family and I’m too young and broke to live on my own. I just turned 20. I am looking to get myself a job that pays about 30$/hr which is a huge increase from what I’m doing now and it’s something that I love doing and so if all things go well I’ll just save up and hopefully by the end of the year move out. 

One thing about my life is that I’ve been dealing with clinical depression for about 6 years now because of my family issues. Oldest sister (28) is very very weird and tries to watch me or something. One time I caught her recording me just doing regular stuff and I’m like why. 

Then there are my parents which is a whole other story. But I’ll just explain that I need space and I just need to do myself and I’ve tried to explain that to my parents but they always always bother me to clean up others messes when everyone is older than me except for my brother (15). I am very much to myself just because of all the things I deal with. So I always just stay in my room and go out to work or workout or shop or something. And if I go downstairs at all I clean up every mess I make. I am pretty ocd about cleaning my mess but I hate cleaning up others especially when it’s a 28 year olds mess. 

So I’m all alone in my room all day trying to learn some stuff about my jobs I want to do in the future because I can’t go to school with my mental issues. My parents say I’ll be a failure and that I’m a disappointment for not going to school but idk I have too much issues with school. So I just learn everything online and do my research all day long. So far it’s been working well everyone goes to me for advice. 

I don’t have any friends right now and even if I did I wouldn’t want to hang out with them as most of the people I know for a fact wouldn’t take the corona seriously. So I just stay home. 

I don’t know what to do now. I want to lose weight but I can’t go to a gym as all the gyms in my area don’t require a mask and I have some equipment at my house but whenever I use it my sister starts to act weird again and it’s the grossest thing ever that I just hate everything afterwards. So idk I’ve been gaining weight ever since the beginning of the virus about 60lbs. Which sucks because I just lost 60lbs so I just gained back everything I lost and worked soooo hard for. 


I’m just so depressed and I wish I had someone I could go to for comfort as I can’t go to my mom I hate her with all my heart and I can’t go to my dad because he always brings her up and makes a whole big deal and then starts spiraling.

But since 1,5 year we always fight about his porn addiction. He lied to me very often and has so much porn things, pics, second accounts on his phone. He definetly knows how it hurts me. He already paid for porn (patreon, cam girls). It completely destroyed my trust and I feel worthless. In addition he shows barley sexual interest in me. 
Tbh and it is hard but I am still together with him cause I dont want to be alone. I dont have parents or siblings and due covid I would be totally alone if I would break up.
Since 3 months or so there is this other man. He works at my place but due covid we all did home office. Then we had a project together and worked many times per week through face time with other collegues. At first I didnt think about something. Cause I am such a loyal and sensitive person. Although my bf hurt me so so so much I never would cheat on him. Rather I would break up and then start a new relationship. But some days ago I found out my bf wrote with women on instagram in a sexual way, and this was like the cherry on the top. I was so sad and angry. Then I just started to text with my collegue and he was so nice and friendly to me. He knows that I have a bf but none of these problems, cause we both know each other not that long. But in comparison to my bf it was so different. I have to say that we just talked about our job, covid and hobbies. Not sexting or so. And this night I dreamt of him. It was such a lovely and good dream and it was the first time since 1,5 years that I felt great and good enough, although it was just a dream. 
Of course I dont know in which direction this all will go but I think he likes me too. I told him I like to cook. So he invited me (anytime but due covid, maybe just in 2 or 3 months) to his home. He has a pool which he built with friends. 
So my question is: Am I a bad person to feel this way or to start feelings for another man? I really want to feel love and affection again, and my current bf just plays games with his friends all the time or went skating.

There are two things you need to know.

The scene: my dentist’s office. I was in for a crown, so I was going to be there for a while. 
The problem: on an iPhone, if you rapidly tap side buttons five times, it calls emergency services for you. You’ve failed to grope for volume up, you’ve called 911.

I had earbuds in and I was trying to turn my volume up; the dentist was ready to begin. I was numbed on one side and cotton was in my mouth, when instead of increased volume, I heard the phone start ringing. I managed to tip it up from my lap, said, “Oh no,” showed the dentist and hygienist my screen to explain, my dentist said ohh, he’d done that before, too, then I heard, “911, what’s your emergency?”

I explained to the operator that I was so sorry, there wasn’t an emergency, what happened, where I was, and that I had cotton in my numb mouth, here, let me spell that for you. They had to transfer me to dispatch to confirm information. 

The woman at dispatch was a champ. I confirmed my name, what happened, “and when you tap five times, it sends me to you.”
“It certainly does,” she said. “And you’re an employee there?” 
“Nope, I’m a patient. In the chair right now.” 
She laughed, because how could you not, and said, “So you aren’t in any danger right now?”
“Not of anything but further embarrassment, no.”
She said it was okay, and wished me a good afternoon. 

After we hung up, I immediately turned off call with side button in the emergency SOS settings, looked my hygienist dead in the eye, and said, “You watch, now I’m gonna get murdered.” We all laughed, and they got to work on my mouth. 

Nobody had to come visit from the station and it only set us back two minutes. And I took a lorazepam before the visit, so it could’ve been infinitely worse. As clusters go, this was fairly relaxed.

My dentist said he pocket dialed 911 in college. I had questions about how tight his pants were at the time, but I kept them to myself.

Most of you (if not all of you) don’t know me outside of here but I will start by saying that I have been relatively healthy during the covid pandemic— masks everywhere, hand sanitizing, social distancing, etc. 

I have only been to the gym, grocery store and work... even those places I try my hardest to be responsible and healthy for not only myself but those around me......Let’s suffice to say that SOMEHOW I contracted covid this past week or so and found out yesterday I am POSITIVE 😬😖😫 I am so upset— per the normal response but what is making this so hard for me is that my father has cystic fibrosis and intertistial lung disease. He finds out in February if he is even a candidate for a lung transplant as he is at the end of his medication route. Needless to say, I haven’t been around him in months which has been hard on its own. Monday (right before I found out my diagnosis) I met with my mom for a few minutes and gave her a hug before leaving out of habit... I didn’t think about the possibility of having covid because I didn’t have any symptoms until yesterday. It was a reckless mistake as I had been so diligent otherwise... well now, they (my sister and mom) are basically shaming me and making me feel like shit over something I am obviously upset about myself. Saying “if he gets it and dies, it’s your fault”. That isn’t really fair IMO, I told them to wait and see what his test say in a few days before freaking out. When I told my dad how I really felt on the phone last night he seemed fine and told me to kick covids ass (lol— his usual fighting spirit) but then later when my mom called he seemed less chipper and way more concerned/upset that I put them all in jeopardy. Whatever...😩

FTR: my s/o thinks they are overreacting. I can’t blame them though for some of the things they are saying....although it still hurts to think about. I haven’t been able to fully process it but when I was at my doctor and found out my dx, my doctor told me not to be so hard on myself. Basically: “the whole world is going through this, everywhere you go puts you or someone you care about at risk, so don’t worry just focus on being healthy and fighting this... stress leads to a weakened immune system”

With that said, I agree, still feeling guilty but I decided that I can’t help what I can’t help. I made the decision to go around my mom when I thought I just was having a sinus infection.

Her:  yeah but being with someone involves responsibility, like you need to communicate and be open about your feelings, you need to involve that person in your life, you can’t just ghost them for a few months and then go back to talking (which is how I treat all of my relationships). and when you all of a sudden have to do all those things that you didn’t have to do before and you’re not ready to do you just feel trapped and stressed and awful   
Me:  why didn't you let me help you  
Her:  because you can’t help me with that. that’s something I gotta figure out myself :)   


I really love her and I wanna get her back. I know if this wasn't an issue then we'd still be together. Is it even possible for me to help her at all? I know she is open to change but I don't think she knows how to do that. like just being there for her and being her friend will let her know that I'm not going anywhere maybe?

A couple years ago, my other sister [19F] started helping her with her homework, which eventually turned into her flat out writing her essays and tests for her. I live internationally from my family and don’t see them often, but when I do I generally see middle sister doing the youngest’s work while youngest online shops with my mom’s credit card or makes tiktoks. Today, when my middle sister was struggling with the youngest’s essay, my roommate [25M] jumped in to help. I finally confronted my youngest sibling about it and told her that college is not going to be easy if someone else does all the work to get her there (she wants to go to medical school). She yelled something about how no one in the family cares about her etc and locked herself in her room. My mom chastised me for causing conflict and “putting anxiety in her head about college” when it could still be years away, alluding to how I didn’t start until I was 21. I persisted, saying that it’s not fair for my sister and roommate to be doing her work when they both have their own studies to deal with. My mom finally said that she would “find something that my youngest sister could do to contribute”. She then went to youngest’s room to bring her lunch where she was still sulking about how “mean” I was. Honestly, it made me feel crazy. She shouldn’t just be “contributing”, it’s her work that she is going to receive credit for. AITA?

They have different fathers.

My daughter's dad, ""Ex"", hasn't been involved before now, but he's here now and is trying to make up for lost time, which I fully support. However, with Ex comes his family, and I had all sorts of problems with them when we were together. They'd ask really invasive questions and make very offensive comments all the time about my religion.

When I named my daughter, I named her after one of my grandparents, the same as I did for my son. My grandparents had/have very stereotypically Jewish names. Think ""Miriam"" and ""Mendel"", though the real names aren't so archaic, but that level of stereotypical Jewish name. Miriam's real name has a bit of an unusual sound in it, but it's found in most languages outside of English, and the name itself, and this pronunciation, are fairly popular in England, where we are.

Ex and I have been easing into 50/50 custody of Miriam, but we're only up to unsupervised weekends right now. Ex told me that he's introduced her to his parents. Miriam came back from Ex's parent's place a couple weeks ago, and at dinner Mendel asked me what his ""English name"" was. I asked him what that meant. He said that Miriam says that we have our Jew names and our English names. I asked her where she got that from and Miriam said that granny and grandpa call her Maisie because they said that's her English name. She admitted to not liking it, but said it's just what they call her. Ex didn't even try to deny it, immediately defending his parents, saying they can't pronounce the name and they're too close minded to learn it. I said they can learn, but he insisted otherwise. When I pointed out that Miriam doesn't like it, he said she's 5, she doesn't know what she likes.

So I sat both kids down for a talk about anti-Semitism, microaggressions, and the importance of learning people's names, and said, in no uncertain terms, that their names are the names I gave them, they reflect their heritage, and the only person who can change them is themselves. Miriam has continued going round Ex's house, and today she went back to her grandparents for the first time since that talk. She refused to respond to ""Maisie"" and apparently said something like ""mummy says Maisie is rude"".

They did not take it well. Ex brought Miriam back a full day early and after I sent her to bed he asked me to step outside, which I did, and he proceeded to accuse me of trying to turn Miriam against him/his family, said I was trying to make him look like a bad father and his parents like bad grandparents, and that I'd confused Miriam, upset his parents, and shown him up. He says he's trying to connect with Miriam and I've caused issues with that, so he wants me to undo it, so she responds to Maisie again.

I said that they can and will learn her damn name, and I won't help them teach her to hide her Jewishness to make his parents more comfortable. He said I was overreacting and unreasonable as it's just a nickname and accused me of using her as a pawn in my own personal issues with his family. He also said I was driving a wedge between Miriam and her grandparents, and between him and Miriam by extension, and that he was struggling enough being introduced to her life at this stage of her life, I didn't have to make connecting with her harder than it was, and that of all the debates I could choose to stand firm on, this is a relatively minor one compared to all the other negotiations we'll have to come to over the years.",0,0,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,self,AITA for teaching my daughter that her father's family giving her a nickname is anti-Semitic?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/l3rldx/aita_for_teaching_my_daughter_that_her_fathers/,all_ads,8634.5

I’m a 17 year old female. I have autism and other neurological disorders like anxiety and OCD. I live with my mom, younger sister and two grand parents. My parents spit when I was 3, and we have lived with my grandparents ever since. ( just to clarify my grandparents pay the bills and my mom is unemployed because of her social anxiety. )
   
   So my mom is more emotionally abusive then she is physically. My sister is her favorite and it’s very clear. My sister has her own room ( I have to share the same bed with my mom because “ I’m to immature to have my own and beds are to expensive anyway” ), my sister always gets to talk over me even if I’m talking about something important, she will buy my sister food and necessities but makes me pay for all of my stuff. Which I wouldn’t mind since I have a good job but she controls my schedule so I only work one day a week, at $8.50 a hour and I only work about 6 hours. She talks down to me, and won’t listen to me when I’m asking for help when my school is being ableist ( that’s a whole other long story) but the worst part is when my sister ( she is 15 btw) gets physical with me. 

   This week a lot has happened and is the reason I’m asking for help. Last Thursday my mom forgot me at home when she took my sister to school, so I was late to first hour. So I was already upset. My first hour is horrible, and he basically vacated my IEP and basic human decency. I asked for my moms help to get out of his class because this is an everyday thing and she just said “ your a ‘ big girl’ now you can handle yourself. Beside what did YOU do to pervoke him?” ( i think I handled myself very well and was clam and tried my hardest to communicate with my teacher. I didn’t even cry until I left his class!) so she was mad at me. Friday she left me again, and when she came back she said” because of your behavior last night you can walk to school.” So I put on my heavy coat, put in my headphones and started walking. My boyfriend ( he is the sweetest person ever and has been a god send in this mess) texted me to ask why I wasn’t there. ( we uselly met up in the drama room before school ) I told him “ oh I’m walking to school, I should be there by 10:30” and he was like “ it’s 8:40, and super cold out. Why are you walking??!!!” So I told him “ oh my mom told me to. I will be there soon!! I turned on my location just in case!! See you soon!! Love you!!” ( I was really trying to not bother him) well he ended up finding me and picking me up to take me to school. My mom found out and got super mad at me, she drove up to the school and had me come out to her car. I apologized and just walked back in the building. 

 Later when I got home after practice, I was picking up some of my laundry and knocked over some of my sisters stuff. I went to pick it up but she slapped my arm super hard. Like I literally screamed because it hurt so much. It’s been over a week and I still have a mark. My mom told me” well don’t just stand there and cry like you are innocent.” 

  Today we got home from the store and I was super frustrated because every time I tried to say something they interrupted me like I didn’t say anything. So we get home and I’m walking in with all the groceries. My sister wants me to walk faster then I am so she pushes me. I fall and drop all the bags out of my hand. I do say “
F**k you” Whitch I know isn’t nice and I really do feel bad about it now. I pick up the bags and put them on the kitchen table when my sister comes up behind me and says “ what did you say?” She is taller then me and try’s to intimidate me. “ say it again. Say it!” So I say “ I said, f**k you.” She then slaps me really hard on my check. And then walks away to her room. My mom goes to me “ well that was uncalled for. Go apologize to her.”  I just go to the bathroom and cry. And started typing this. 

  I have a counselor I talk to every week, and she knows about all this. She has almost called DHS but I begged her not to since my mom had a degree in DHS and knows all the loop holes and it would just make things worse. My grandparents are toxic and laugh when they see anything happen, like it’s some comedy show. My dad is abusive too, that’s why my parents split. I have tried talking to him but he just told me to “ respect my mother”. my boyfriend is 6 months younger then me and I have only 2 other friends who live out of state. And in my state you can’t get emancipated. I am so lost at what to do and I seriously don’t think I can wait the 16 months tell I graduate or the 10 months until I turn 18.

The relationship wasn't exactly perfect but she was my first serious girlfriend. She had many trust issues despite being quite hypocritical with her actions. She didn't want me having any female friends or following any women on social media. She ended being the one to cheat on me a few times hooking up with mutual friends and sending explicit photos to these friends as well. Aside from our romantic relationship issues we got along extremely well and we shared many similar interests along as aspirations for our lives. I had some of the best adventures of my life with her so far quite literally. We went on lots of road trips together and just explored our home town going to little quirky places or cool spots. 

&amp;#x200B;

It had gotten to the point where I felt like I didn't love her romantically anymore but I still enjoyed her presence and companionship as a friend. I wanted to remain friends with her but I had told her that I no longer loved her romantically but I still cared deeply about her. She broke down completely and I still remember the look in her eyes like it happened yesterday. It killed me seeing her in pain like that. I understood she would need her time to heal and move on but I didn't want to lose her completely. We stopped talking for a while and reconvened a few months later as friends. We travelled a bit together and would spend time with each other as friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

One day she witnessed one of my parents react poorly to an injury I suffered as the result of a bike crash. She took me home after an onlooker on the side of the road called the ambulance to assess my wounds. Nothing serious, just scrapes and a minor sprain, but the contention with this particular parent was that I had been in contact with a medical professional during the covid pandemic. This parent has asthma and they proceeded to explode into a fit of rage directed towards me. She had been aware of the rough relationship I had with my parents but for some reason she was extremely perturbed by this incident and stopped talking to me completely. She blocked me on social media, removed off of some messaging apps, and proceeded to end contact with me without telling me she was going to. She didn't block my phone number so I could still text her but she never responded to my messages so I stopped trying to contact her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since then I've been unable to stop thinking about her. The thoughts are constant and relentless accompanied by dreams that occur a few times a week. Waking up after the dreams of her puts me in a terrible mood for the rest of the day. Everything reminds me of her and my mind bombards with me thoughts of the cheating and toxicity that happened in our relationship. One of her parents came into my work place the other day (I work in a small retail shop) and I nearly had a panic attack. I started to get tunnel vision and I was having trouble breathing. I don't know what to do. I wish these thoughts and memories would just stop because I know she's not coming back. I just can't seem to let go but holding on is killing me. It's making me extremely depressed. When I wake up, I think of her. During the day at work I think of her. It's constant and it gets in the way of me enjoying myself at my job which I love, hanging out with friends or doing certain hobbies that used to bring me immeasurable joy. The worst part is it's preventing from trying to talk to new women and trust people to a certain degree. I can't seem to help myself and I've tried removing all reminders of her from my room and my phone like pictures, letters, and gifts.

I’ve continued ignoring him. After that first message, he tried emailing me and have mutual friends speak on his behalf.

Also, how can you say you're commited to me if you don't want to talk about the future and make plans? 

It seems to me like he doesn't want to be vulnerable and put himself out there and take a chance on me. He's willing to have fun each day with me but won't comitted. Almost like he's stringing me along and keeping his options open for other good things to come along.

Her husband was stuck abroad on business and she needed help with childcare. My roommate was a COVID sceptic and I didn’t want to stay with her because I didn’t trust her to be careful, so it was a win-win situation. My lease expired two months into the first lockdown and my sister suggested I just move in permanently until the world went back to normal, which is what I did.

About 5 months ago, my sister’s brother-in-law came (I’ll refer to him as Daniel) to stay here too. Things have been a nightmare ever since. 

My sister has been with her husband for 13 years, so I’ve known him and his brother since I was 12. When I was 14, I had an embarrassing crush on Daniel. Both of our families made a big deal about it when they found out and he has used every opportunity since to make fun of me for it. My sister got engaged when I was 17 and he spent the entire engagement party asking me if I was fantasizing about it being him and me up there. On their wedding day, he kept asking me if I knew what the bride and groom did on their wedding night and made a bunch of inappropriate comments about us and wedding nights. Our families used to spend Christmas together so you can imagine he took every single opportunity to take digs at me. 

To be completely upfront, we slept together about three Christmases ago. It was more of a “get it out of your system and never talk about it again” situation, and it seemed to work because he stopped making jokes. Until now.

Ever since he moved in, he’s been more insufferable than before. He makes sly comments about that Christmas and he isn’t even subtle about it. He’s so obvious that my sister and her husband pulled me aside to ask if something had happened between us. I lied and said nothing had happened only for him to go and tell his brother everything. 

Recently he’s started intentionally sitting right next to me even if there’s plenty of other empty chairs. This happened a few days ago and I got up straight away and moved. My eldest niece noticed and made a comment about it. She said something like “Aunty doesn’t like you Uncle Daniel” and this genius decided to reply with ”Aunty is scared she’ll fall in love with me again” so now I have my nieces thinking it’s true too.

I finally had enough and complained to my sister and she thinks he’s just joking, and he’s always been this way. She told me to just ignore him because they’re harmless and he doesn’t mean anything bad by it. I’m honestly this close to just yelling at him but I don’t want to do that in case my nieces overhear, and it upsets them.

So, what can I do? How do I get him to stop? I’m starting to think my only option is to make stupid comments back, but I don’t want to lower myself to his level and a part of me is worried that would just encourage him.

TL;DR – My sister’s brother-in-law and I have known each other since I was 12. When I was 14 it got out that I had a crush on him, and our families made a huge deal about it. Ever since he’s taken every opportunity to tease me relentlessly over it.

I've possibly been over thinking this, but here goes:

A good friend of mine from high-school sadly passed away recently, and I was thinking about our times together at school.

At summer ball (our end of school 'leaving-do') I was sitting down next to my friend. We were talking for a bit, just before dinner was served. (I am so shy!...)

After we had finished speaking and dinner was served, she then stroked my arm, but not just a little touch, she stroked up and down a total of six times.

None of my other friends have ever stroked my arm like that - either at school or since - was there any significance in it? Is it a rare or common thing to do, and why would you stroke someone's arm six times?

This happened a few years ago by the way - I am just reflecting on the times I had with this friend for personal and sentimental reasons. For reference, I was very fond of this friend myself. I miss her so much.

so me and a friend have the great tradition of breaking in a school once a year. we use to go into the school in the evening, then hide in two lockers until everyone left. then we usually have a great time by ourselves drinking and eating snacks. 
there have been a few occasions, where really crazy stuff happened, but the wildest one is this: 
we just came out of the lockers and wanted to start the party. as we walked down the stairs to get our booze, we saw what we thougt was a dead boby outside the building. to give some context, it was nighttime and winter, so dark and cold af. we are at that point kind of panicking. we cant call the police and tell them where we have seen the body??
so we put a little stone between the door, so we can come in again later, bc we had all our stuff in the school. we go on the roof of the school, where you can go to even when the school is closed. luckily, the body is also visible from there, it lays like on the edge of the roof, but not a roof where you should go, like further down. 
so we call the police and tell them we saw a body. a few minutes later, the police, firemen and an ambulance arrive. they get the 'body'. its a boy, around 14 years of age. he is drunk af, cant respond to them and has a broken collarbone and is under normal temperature. 
they take him to the hospital and begin to ask us stuff. we lie a lot bc they ask us why we are here, where we have seen him etc. they even brought a detective, who should ask us seperatly, so were in a reeally dumb situation, bc we didnt talk about an alibi. 
so we tell them that we really wanna go home, were so tired etc, and they let us go. all the police cars etc are standing right in front of the door we put a stone in between... in a brief moment, we sprint to the door and run inside again, where we drank ourselves to sleep

so yeah turns out the boy was drinking with his friend. his friend fell asleep, meanwhile he fell down the roof. his friend wakes up, cant see him and decides to go home, what left the boy in the cold, asleep/ unconcious.

moral of the story: something a little illegal can save someones life!

TL ; DR i broke in a school, saw a liveless body out of the window, on the roof. had to lie to the police a bit, then snuck inside the school again and drank booze

However we are otherwise on good terms.

Lydia got pregnant after a drunk one-night-stand, the dad was never in the picture. She’s always been a good mum to her daughter, Ellie (now 8). My parents chipped in a bit when she fell on hard times, but otherwise she did most of it on her own.

Now here’s the thing, Lydia was sadly diagnosed with cancer several years go. She’s been in and out of treatment but her most recent prognosis is…not good, and she’s understandably trying to make arrangements for Ellie. I recently found out she wants me to be Ellie’s guardian.

Now here’s the situation: I’m currently 26 and still living with our parents. The reason for this is I have autism (some would call it “high functioning”, but really with autism that’s relative). I can only manage a part-time job as it is. If not for my parents’ help; I might not be able to make ends meet. The other this is I’m really, really sensitive to noise, and sadly kids make a lot of noise. I could not be a full-time carer, I’m unsure I’d even be able to take care of myself. 

So I told her it could not possibly be me, that she needs to ask our parents. Now I told my parents this and they are willing to do it (and we could convert Lydia’s old room to a kid’s room again) etc.

When I told Lydia this, she got angry, saying she needs it to be me, not our parents (our parents are quite old, and she’s scared they might not live until Ellie is an independent adult).

She also knows I have a boyfriend and she’s sort of banking on us getting married, so she got it in her head we could be “parents”.

I told her that I simply cannot take that responsibility, that I am already incredibly anxious about how I’ll manage myself after our parents will be gone, let alone with a child. I told her that if she doesn’t want our parents to do it, she needs to find another candidate herself.

She started screaming at me about how I am selfish and how or parents always helped me more and that I needed to give something back. I understand this is frustrating to her, but I feel my parents have been good to both of us, I just needed more help with my disability.

I told her I understand this must be very painful for her, but I’m really not the person for this. 

She slammed the door on me.

(P.s., Of course I would help if Ellie came to live with us, I just do not want full/legal responsibility. Also I need to be able to isolate if she’d overstimulate me.)

He’s also a heavy smoker (weed) &amp; he’s helped me be so open about it. But I’m realizing I’m not sure if that’s something I want in a partner. Maybe if he casually smoked it’d be fine but idk I still have mixed feelings about him doing it every day. And at this point if it’s still bothering me then I don’t see it going away. 

I just feel like we both deserve better but I do love him so much &amp; really want this to work out. And before I would do anything to make this work. But once he said he wanted to be alone I guess it made me feel like it doesn’t matter how much I adapt to keep him happy. If he wants to leave he will.

There was a recent post about a father who discovered his wife had been reading their child's diary without her knowledge and the father wanted to tell his daughter the truth.  I, naively, shared this story with my wife to gain her insight and  I thought we were on the same page.  I was wrong.

For simplicity I'll start calling daughter A and wife K.

About a week ago K revealed to me that she had been reading A's diary because she was worried about her mental health.  Honestly I think she was concerned because A had started talking to a counselor and wouldn't share what was said during those sessions.  She found out that A was very angry with her and is not handling this info very well.

I told K that I was incredibly disappointed and this was a serious invasion of privacy.  She was obviously upset that I didn't agree but was completely unrepentant about her actions and said she had no intention of stopping.

So I bought a lock and told her it was to keep her older brother (13) and little sister (6) out of it.  I did not mention her mother, I just can't bring myself to tell her.

My wife now thinks ITA because she just wants to gain insight into A's mental health and I believe she should sit down and have an honest conversation.  So Reddit what do you think?

Edit:  First I want to thank everyone who contributed to this post.  Your well wishes did not go unnoticed, you advice was taken to heart and your stories have opened my eyes to so much that needs to change in my house.  The awards where humbling and greatly appreciated.  

I hope there was some catharsis for those that shared and please know my heart hurts for you all.  My wife and I have begun talking about attending therapy ourselves.  I think she may have noticed the lock and gotten the message, I don't know for sure.  I am going to sit them both down and we are going to go over A LOT of the advice here.

I also want to thank those that offered the harshest criticism.  You gave me some of the greatest clarity.

Nothing was ever defined cause it started off casual but as I got to know him I really fell for him tbh. He was a nice distraction from problems I’ve been having and he was always just really nice to me and was there to listen.

I knew that nothing was going to come from this but I could t help but think...maybe? I mean the signs were there...or at least in my head they were there.

So one day I decided to asked him what the vibe was and he didn’t really respond. He just asked me what I wanted. So I said ideally I would like a relationship but obviously that’s not gonna happen. 

After that I kind of got mad because the whole time I was thinking...damn like why tho? It seems like you like me so why? Im not asking you to come out I just wanted to know how you felt bout me? And soooo I sort of kicked him out cause I was pissed.
 
A week later, he told me he did like me and he wanted to try and make things work. So I said ok and we were on good terms.

But come a couple days later we’re hooking up and then after I just get sad again. I get the same feeling I got the week prior...why? Why am I not enough? So I basically put on my sad face(I can’t help but make a sad face when I get sad) and tried to ignore those thoughts. But as the night progressed I couldn’t and so I confront him. I told him I wanted to make this work but it makes me really sad because we cant so i can’t promise i will want to keep talking to you. So he asked me again what do I want. And I was just straight up like I want someone to love me man. In hindsight I think i might’ve been a bit forward but that’s how I felt and still feel. I don’t need someone to hookup with. He said that we’re not just hooking up but something about the way he said it didn’t have the confidence i needed to be reassured. So after a couple more minutes of cuddling he left and we haven’t talked since except for the Christmas and New Years text i got from him.

Now to my dilema...It’s been like three weeks now and Im feeling lonely,bored and horny again. So my question is...do I text him? I want to cause I’m like aw he was fun why did I end this? But then in reality I think it would be weird cause 1. i basically told this man in my own weird way I think I might love him and 2. I don’t really trust him and that’s why I was over trying. Like Ok if you can’t say what’s on your mind even if it hurts then obviously I can’t trust you to be honest. As well Im pretty sure I was a side piece cause he was sus with his phone and that’s a red flag in my eyes.

Hi guys. I’m unsure if I need advice or just a place to vent, but here goes. I have been with my boyfriend for just over four years now, never really had an argument, get along really well and are able to work things out together. We have lived together for seven months and it has been amazing, even with the lockdowns we have had fun and I’ve really enjoyed the time we’ve had together. He’s a really great guy and I love him to pieces, I have no complaints about our relationship at all (except for maybe socks on the bedroom floor, but I can get over that). 

A few weeks ago, we talked about our dreams of buying a house, and I mentioned that I would love to have a garden so that when I eventually have a kid they can have space to run around and play. I then asked him if he had ever really thought about having a child, to which he said no, and that he just can’t picture himself doing it. I managed to play it off but this was upsetting to hear, because I know that when two people have different feelings about kids, it’s normally a dealbreaker, and I find it so hard to imagine my life without him.

I have searched online and read the same articles over and over again, and I guess I know how this is going to end, even though I find the idea of it so devastating. I guess I am wondering how next to have this conversation with him, to make sure that we both get our thoughts out in the open. We have another five months left on our lease and I feel as if bringing up now could cause the rest (if it is the end) of our time together to be really awkward and uncomfortable. Do I wait until we are asked to renew the contract? I am getting upset by thoughts of this conversation nightly and end up toying with the idea of not having a child just to be with him in the early hours of the morning when I can’t sleep (I know this is a bad idea, I won’t do it). 

I’m sorry if this is a bit rambly, I am desperately in love with him and this is awful. Please do ask questions if you have any. Thanks.

We started talking about moving in together in October of last year. He has had some issues in past relationships when living with an SO so he was hesitant but decided he was sure about it before we started our search. We have been looking for places for August of this year and have gone to look at a few places after agreeing on our wants and needs for a home. We originally wanted to just stay at the house I have rented for the last 4 years due to location and cost but, my landlord denied him because of insurance issues involving the breed of my boyfriends ESA.   

Yesterday he tells me that he changed his mind. I wasn’t sure what to say at first and was just shocked that he felt that way. We had just been talking about it an hour before and he was confirming that he wanted to look deeper at a few places with me. I felt hurt and deceived, I took some time to myself to cry and ended up crying for most of the night. It hurt to know he could look me in the eyes and talk about it when he secretly had no desire to live with me anymore. 

Today and decided since he was certain in his feelings I would reach out to my landlord and ask about resigning for the next year. My landlord told me that he wouldn’t be allowing me to resign. So now I feel lost, my relationship hit a wall and I don’t know why he changed his mind and lied about his desire to live with me for so long. Adding to that I now have to try to find a new place to move that I can afford without our combined budget, because my landlord now sees me as a liability. 

My boyfriend has just been telling me that I am overreacting and invalidating my feelings. I started to cry again today after my landlord’s response and my boyfriend just told me to stop crying and that it’s just a house. To me it feels like I lost the most stable thing in my life, this place has been my home for 4 years now. I was only prepared to leave it because we were going to make somewhere new *our* home, but now it will just be me. 

Am I being ridiculous? Should this not be affecting me the way it is? 

How do I have a conversation with him about feeling hurt and deceived?  I need help finding a starting point to getting up from this hit.

I'm a storywriter and the most difficult/frustrating thing I've found is writing and developing guy characters. I do the same procedure as I do when creating girl characters, just jumble up a bunch of character traits and get a new character smoothie, but I feel like there's more I could possibly do.

So here's a question to the men and boys of reddit, growing up, what were some attributes of guy characters you wished you could've seen growing up? Some women wish that there were more girl characters that could rely on themselves rather than a prince, is there anything like that for you guys?

And when she complains to me I can’t feel sorry anymore. Broke your toe? That’s to bad (eyeroll). Wrecked your bicycle? Oh well (shrug).  Got a huge bill because you miscalculated your taxes? Gosh (sigh). 

There are never ever fun times with her. There’s ALWAYS something wrong. I already give her monthly some money to get by, but it’s never enough. When I buy something she’s sighing how awful it is that she’s so poor. Got a gift from my MIL? She cries how she’s upset that she can’t give anything to us. And I feel truly sorry for her situation, but it’s always about her.

When she comes to visit she’s suddenly incapable of doing anything. From stirring her coffee to getting her phone adapter, I have to do everything. She comes to me? Great, I can cook for her. I visit her? Great, I can cook for her. 

I feel so empty. She’s draining me and I feel like an awful person to think like this about my mom. She can be sweet. Her intentions are good, but she got spoiled by her dad as a child. She was the golden child, didn’t need to do anything so I think that she doesn’t know better. I feel like there’s nothing in this relationship for me. I tried talking, but she gets so defensive, crying what an awful mother she is and how I must hate her. There is no getting through. I can’t give the slightest comment on her behaviour without creating a big emotional scene.

If almost everyone is wearing a headscarf, then the girl that has to wear a headscarf due to religion, alopecia or cancer wouldn't be given unwanted attention or weird looks.

Edit: because apparently everyone is missing my point. I NEVER said head scarves should be required or mandated, I'm saying it shouldn't be out of place and should be fairly common to wear headscarves by making it fashionable and normal piece of accessory that women CAN wear.

Ok for background

my(M26) girlfriend(F24) and i have been together for 5 years now. we have not been living together but we are slowly tying up our finances even though we haven't really talk about marriage yet seriously i like to think that that's where we will end up eventually

for context my girlfriend is a bit of a spender where she impulsively buy stuff out of her own pocket that i sometimes had to remind her to easen up a bit and it's ok to spend money granted that it is still within her budget.

 then one day she told me that her aunt was selling her car that was an old suv 2000 model that i know has many problems and was not really taken care of for quite some years now because her aunt doesn't really know how to maintain a car. my gf said it was being sold for 170k or (3,500usd) which is still pretty high in our country for that type of car i told her it's expensive and she doesn't really respond to that and we just go our way.

then after a few days when we got together she told me she and her brother brought the car to split and i was shocked because she didn't even asked for my opinion about them buying it. don't get me wrong i know I don't have the right to get mad or even be asked for my opinion but the thing is they didn't even thought of anything before buying the car they just impulsively buy it without weighing the pros and cons. that's when we got to have and argument because i said, I really don't care what you bought i was just disappointed that you didn't even told me that you were going to buy it

she said really don't have a say about the matter because it's her and her family's decision and it's her money anyway. which i TOTALLY said she was right and then told her

""so if i get a motorcycle now(which i really like to buy even before we got together but didn't get because she said she don't like it even though it will greatly help me fpr transportation and would really be more cost effective than commuting) she won't have a problem with it? because coming from her logic it's my money anyway and and i should have the same freedom as you?""

and she straight up said that i just break up with her if i will get my motorcycle to which i said that was completely unfair and that's why i was disappointed that i wasn't ask for my opinion regarding the car because it was a big purchase that might affect our lives and so was the motorcycle that's why i haven't bought it without her consent. 

i have reatirated that I don't really have a problem with her buying the car. my problem is with her not consulting me about the purchase. thinking that it was unfair for me that she gets to get what she wanted without my opinion but i can't get what i want without having to go to her first.

surprisingly,  after all the fiasco she actually admitted her mistakes and she apologized, but she questioned herself in this relationship because she easily gets mad at me over games. in the end, I always find a reason to not play with her, I just can't risk this happening again

as of now, I'm considering retiring from Valorant since, but she stills plays it and sometimes still got mad but not as severe as when she's mad at me. also, every time she talked about anything related to Valorant, my mood instantly goes away and I just replied to her with what she expected me to reply because of how it reminds me of that moment.

what I wanna ask is how can I tell her that I stopped playing the game because I don't want the event to happen again? should I or shouldn't tell her?

tl;dr op gf got mad every time op fucks up in-game

I hate every damn case there is. I specifically hate chunky, OtterBox like cases. It makes your phone feel cheap, especially if you have glass phones, I like the feel of the glass, and I'm okay with not putting a case on it. 


Screen protectors. I hate them. And most people should know if the package says they protect from impacts, that's a scam, your phone is going to get hit either way, glass is glass and it shatters. And alot of screen protectors just look ugly and don't help with the resistive touch. 


For those of you that are going to say ""you don't take care of your phones your spoiled."" First of all you don't know me and second of all I do take care of 'em. I take really good care of them. Sure I have had one or two phones fall on me but that's okay, nothing exploded or stopped working.


And yes I understand, the reason why you would want to put a case and a screen protector is to sell it in the future. That is the dumbest idea I have ever heard, the smartphone market is constantly evolving and that ihpone 11 you and I have 2-3years, 200$. that's it, and mabey even less. 


I hope other people have the same opinion as me, everyone I know loves cases and loves condom wrapping there phones to protect them.


I didn't make it clear what the opinion is.

Lets get this out of the way right now, I have my criticisms of china, from their religious persecution, to their authoritarian government, concentration camps, hijacking the South china sea etc etc.

But the more I look into it the more I realize we aren't getting the full story and I don't think anybody can argue the us is much better with its constant wars, incompetent politicians, obsession with race, gender and all that stuff just to name a few.

Which brings me to why I think china should be top dog. Simply put america needs a right humbling, we have forgotten ourselves. We have gotten so obsessed with canceling others, social justice, and the pointless song and dance that is American politics that we've not only forgotten what really matters and by extention who is really in charge.

That being corporate big wigs and big tech, like people got excited about people getting banned from Twitter for political beliefs either not realizing or caring about the consequences of social media sites having that kind of power, going like "" oh I don't have to worry, it will never happen to me"" yes it absolutely will. NEVER think it won't happen to you.

Let me put it another way, we have reached the point where tiktok allows for more freedom of speech and expression then twitter. TIKTOK! Thats absurd to think about but its true.

And let's be real people around the world are getting sick of social media being inundated with American politics, and really the only reason people put up with our shit is because we have money, its like that guy you're dating that you don't like but you deal with him because he's loaded.

Without that you wouldn't take him seriously at all. My point is america needs to stop obsessing over social justice, identity politics, cancel culture and this pointless power struggle, and realize its not the hot stuff it thinks it is, and the only way that's gonna happen is america gets knocked off its high horse economically.

As I said earlier, America needs a good humbling kick to the mouth, if that means an evil dictatorship must be top dog for a while...
