Sorry for the format and English in advance and for the long post to come... 

Nsfw - contains some sexual description

A little background:

My (29F) bf (30m) and I have been together for 3.5y. moved in about a y ago.

In the beginning of our relationship it was a rollercoaster, lost of ups and downs but we managed to get through it and decided to be stronger and not let little things get in the way 

The sex was great. Like super great. The best I ever had! 
Quality and quantity (very rare to find at least for me)
And so we decided to spice things a little bit and explore some of the swing world.
We are a kinky couple with some fetiches and so it seemed fun! So we joined a platform for swingers and started talking to other couples and it was fun! But we never did the full thing.

Part because we had to move to another city and part because I started to feel a bit uncomfortable with my body (even though men still found my curves sexy). So it went on stand by 

We move almost 2y ago (so 1y apart in the same city, 1y together) and since we moved our sex life just went down.... We have sex maybe, maybe! Once every 2months.
I still give him head because I like it and he still treats me as well. But regarding sex is close to zero.

At first I thought it was because of a growing OCD obsession he has with cleaning and organising finances (even if it's all ok). He takes hours at home on that and goes to bed super late or super tired. And he is really on that cause I've seen it and try to help.

But lately he has started talking about the swing world again. 
I told him I was ok with it but only if we had an healthy sex life ourselves first and not use it to substitute cause that is not being with me. 

The last time he brought it up I finally told me he needs it for his mental state. 
You see, I'm a very tight person (you know where) and my irregular lubrication makes is very hard on him. Like hard hard. He can't control himself and usually last not very long.
We though it might be a medical problem but he has no issues with other stimulation other than penetration.
It has been making a mess in his head cause he was never like that with other women

So having a second couple would help in 3 things:
1 finding if his issue is just with me
2 finding if other guys have the same issue
3 finding a way to solve our problem and have a better sex life

So I agreed

Fast forward to a few hours ago

I had to use his phone to compare some setting on an app to use on my one (Skype). Don't worry we share our phones normally, it's not a big deal.

And for my surprise his Skype is full of conversations with other couples! I was and am shocked... Couldn't sleep a thing.
Even more because he used a new account on which I don't have access

I confronted him and he laughed at me... Refusing to answer my questions

I asked him why he hide it when we agreed on doing it (no answer)
How long (no answer)
Was he using it as a single or for his benefits (said no)
Has he aware of how betrayed I felt (yes)
But no explanation (no answer)

He said it's not a big deal cause he doesn't mind who I speak to! I was even more shocked!!

I asked for access to that account since it concerns both but he denied
Because I still have access to the platform i know it has been going at least since the end of the year. Messages with more than 15d are automatically erased.

I will try to speak to him again today...

I know most of you will say to drop him and that he is cheating... That's the common comments.

I just want to understand why...
And get this out of my chest

We have been best friends for five years and have always supported each other (especially emotionally). She is and has been the closest person to me for almost as long as we've known each other. I cannot express how much I love her, and I know she feels the same. However, for a while now we've been really struggling when it comes to the sexual part of our relationship. 

We are both insecure, but she helps me overcome how I feel about myself and I am very comfortable with her at this point. She, on the other hand, has been struggling with being physically vulnerable around me recently. She has assured me it has nothing to do with trust and that she is still attracted to me, she just can't get over the hate she holds for herself. Because of this, we haven't had sex in over three months. I refuse to ever push her to do anything when she feels uncomfortable with it and at this point, I've stopped even trying to initiate anything. We still spend time together and snuggle in bed, etc., but I'm struggling not having any remotely sexual aspect to our relationship. She has never been a super sexual person, but she was always happy to do things as long as they were relatively vanilla. For reference, she was never comfortable kissing in front of anyone--even hello or goodbye, but at night time when we were alone, she was usually okay with fooling around. It wasn't until our one year anniversary that we actually had sex. We did it on occasion since then, but somewhat infrequently. We still did other stuff most nights we spent together, until a little under a year ago when it became noticeably less frequent. Being a stereotypical 18-year-old guy when it comes to that sort of thing, I was always ecstatic to do anything, so it was always her wants that would decide if we did or did not. 

COVID hasn't helped our situation; we don't see each other nearly as often as we did last year and have grown apart just a little bit--though we are still very clsoe. However, I don't see COVID as the root of the problem and I feel like there is something other than just her self-hatred standing in the way of us. Even with the separation, I still text her and ask to watch movies online together (etc.) on a regular basis, but she usually lacks the motivation to say yes. She has been having trouble with motivation on all fronts for a while now, the pandemic function as a pretty big depressor. 

I worry and sometimes ask her if she just isn't sexually attracted to me anymore, but she always tells me she is and ends up feeling badly. She thinks that because I ask her questions like that, she is making me hate myself. She feels guilty every day for ""hurting me"". I explain to her how much I love her and, though it's hard, I'm here for her and want to help her with her self-esteem problems. At this point, she is so sure she is making my life entirely miserable that she has brought up breaking up on several occasions. We are very honest with each other, but my insecurities sometimes make me doubt her attraction to me. 

Neither of us want to break up, and we have already said that we would stay friends no matter what. But she is depressed and I don't think I am helping no matter how hard I try. I have asked her on many occasions if there is anything I am doing to contribute to the problem or if there is anything I can do to help, but it always makes her feel worse and her answer is always no. 

I love her and I love spending time with her. She always makes me smile and makes me happy. I am sure that I still make her happy as well. I just don't know what to do anymore, the whole situation just feels wrong.

I'm 24f if that matters. We'll call my aunt Susan, my cousins, Jack and Jill and I'll refer to my mom as such. Susan is a single mother and my cousins' father have been in and out since Jill was born. Susan was one of those persons who was okay with using the belt so to speak. In retrospect, her beatings probably erred on the side of abuse, but corporal punishment is unfortunately prominent in the Caribbean. Throughout their lives, Susan proved to be a strict and difficult mother. Now, Jill is in university and Jack has just finished high school. He's been the more rebellious one. There have been many incidents of Susan pushing her kids to their limit, by the way she put them down, the way she sheltered and tried to control them, forcing them into extra curriculars that they did not enjoy. These are just to name a few. Things came to a head a couple months ago, maybe in November, Jack was found with a small vape, their mother was furious and smashed it with a hammer and called him terrible things. My mom and I are unsure if she hit him or tried to. This was Jack's breaking point. He shut down and completely shut Susan out not even addressing her to say good day. All this while the 3 of them lived together. Now, I want to interject here and say that Jack and Jill's father has been there for them financially and been a larger support when they got older. Jack had some troubles as a teen with Susan and lived with his father for a bit. During this current time, Jack has been living with his mother, I am not clear on the details as I myself was living in another country for a couple years. Jack perhaps, could've easily gone back to his father, even with the covid regulations in our country, (Remember, Caribbean, so small islands) however, because all 3 of them are home, he preferred to stick around for Jill in case of anything with their mother. The main incident that has caused this little family to split apart, occurred a little before christmas and then before new years. Some of the details are still blurry as my mom and I got condensed versions of what happened. Essentially, Jill wanted to go look at some drive through lights with a couple friends (Within covid regulations). She asked her mom who said to ask her dad and if he said yes it would be fine, but it made no sense to ask her dad because her mom made more of a fuss and he wasn't living with them in the first place. Jill didn't even bother to ask and took her mom's previous statement as a yes. Her dad showed up to their house for something, i think to drop off food, and Susan mentioned Jill going out to him, he of course had no knowledge of this, but also was not upset about not knowing. He believe that Jill is a responsible young adult and knows how to conduct herself. An argument ensued between Jill and Susan.  This is the incident that occurred before Christmas and Jill suspects is the catalyst for her mother's outburst a few days later. Jack and Jill have locks on their rooms, but their mother keeps the spare keys to them. She goes into their rooms at will and does not show any regard for their privacy, even as young adults. The morning of the second incident, Susan went into Jill's room, and told her terrible things. ""get out of my house so you can go s\*ck c\*ck."" ""you'll only get anywhere in life by f\*cking man"" things along this vein (also I'm paraphrasing). Jill tried to argue back as well not even sure where this came from and why it was happening. Understandably she was hurt. Susan tried to hit her, but Jill held her hand and told her no. She tried to lock herself in her room, but ofc susan got the key and got in to continue to berate her more. Eventually, Jack and Jill got a hold of their father and he picked them up.  Jill forgot her glasses at Susan's a couple days later, but was also on her way to run an errand and just had to stop to grab them. She called Susan before she left home by her dad, and said she was on her way for her glasses. Susan said to get the rest of her stuff too. Jill said she didn't have the time right now and that she would do it another day. When she arrived at Susan's all of Jack and Jill's stuff were in garbage bags and their rooms almost completely cleaned out. Susan mixed up their clothes and mixed it with dirty and clean clothes too so they had to wash everything. Mom and I listened to Jack and Jill in horror at what their mother did to them. We offered our support, but they are still very closed up kids, understandably so. Before we got the full account of info, Susan called my mother and told her that Jill and her got in a fight and Jill said ""not even your own sister like you, she bad talks you with the rest of family."" My mom checked with Jill on this and corrected that she actually said ""not even your own family and friends like you , this is why they don't talk to you."" Susan is known to twist stories, and from the beginning we were skeptical of what Susan claimed Jill said. My mom is not one to like drama, she prefers a quiet life, but it breaks our hearts to know that this is what my cousins have gone through. My mom's thing against speaking up to Susan is because she acts extremely... unhinged. She has never taken to advice on how to raise her kids, she does not like to be told that she is wrong, she is entitled and I should've probably codenamed her Karen, but I digress, I'm ranting now. I'll try to wrap this up. My mom does not feel it is her place. At the end of it, we also need her because my grandmother is not in the best of health, and we are not financially well off. Each time my grandmother needs assistance, my mom and her siblings pool together what they can. Mom holds no friendly relationship with Susan, she loathes her for what she has done to Jack and Jill all their lives, but she will not say something outright, unless Susan says something first. Given all of the circumstances, my grandmother's health being the biggest, we are trying to avoid drama as much as possible. Jack and Jill are currently flourishing at their dad's place. They have quite a bit of fixing up to do as Jill has never lived there and never really had a place of her own there. They seem happy, but I still feel they are distant and I also would like advice on how I could get them to understand that I mean what I say when I tell them that I am here for them.

I had a reason for this because late 2019 (October-December) I had been romantically involved with her best friend. I even told L about the way I felt about her best friend. Sadly I got pretty fucked over in my relationship and flat out got played (she was entertaining someone else) and cut off that girl for the most part. To go deeper I hate L's best friend and cannot stand her to this day and its been almost a year now.

Even after this I would still hang out with L and we would go to the same places because we were in the same group. So while I was recovering from my heartbreak my friends started to mention to me that L liked me a lot due to her friends saying that me and her would look great as a couple. I immediately ignored this and shut down that claim due to it being too soon for me and also I had just been involved with her best friend. After this we would still hang out from time to time within our group of friends. Then in February of 2020 we were both at the same club due to it being a mutual friends birthday and I was dancing with her but nothing crazy but then we started to hookup. After that I just thought it was a one time thing but I believe she saw it as something more. The next time I saw her which was at another party I hooked up with her again.

This continued to be a trend for a while but then she would attempt to talk about ""us"" and I would shut it down due to it not being the time to talk about it. She would tell my close friends how much she was into me and how I didn't care, but I really did care I just didn't know how to handle the situation to be truthfully honest. It got better though we had been doing things together enough that I told her I was ready to have ""the talk"" with her and she obviously got excited smiling ear to ear. Then she told me we would talk about it after her dad's heart surgery (he's an older man) and I was fine with that. **The week after is when COVID hit and the country went into shutdown**.

So due to the shutdown I really didn't see her for two months but we spoke everyday over text. I didn't know what to do because I was actually concerned for her dad's health but I wanted to see her but everyone was staying home and not seeing anyone. One day the best friend who broke my heart texted me asking me if she can call me and I asked her ""what could you possibly call me about"" she said about L, so I let her call me which now I regret because I allowed her to get into my relationship with L. In the call which was around 45 mins it was her going on a tangent telling me to make it official with L that what had happened between me and her was a blessing because now I was with L. This infuriated me on the inside because I was still pissed about what had happened between us (she ended up dating the other guy and is still with him to this day). She even began to cry in ""happiness"" due to me and L being together. After this phone call I was pissed for a while. When lockdown began to chill out a bit (I live in Florida) I made a plan with L for us to hang out with some of our friends. By the way she is still waiting to have ""the talk"" so she expecting to have it there. It never came, I just never got to it. So she texted me saying that we had to talk and I said to myself ""wow I'm really gonna do this and commit to a relationship with her"" I was excited and anxious.

We went to some nice area near where I live and walked around the park having a great conversation and everything was going nice. So we went to go eat at place nearby and when we sat down I told her ""So lets talk about it then"" and I let her go first. My fears had been realized and she ended it. I was in shock she left me speechless, I was expecting to leave that place with a relationship with substance behind it but she chose to end due to me not showing effort and taking too long. I was still in shock I didn't even eat the food I ordered. At the same time I took it gracefully and told her if thats what she wanted then it was fine while still being absolutely confused. The car ride back was obviously weird but we were still cracking jokes due to us still being friends but once I got home my confusion began to kind of morph into anger. I was blindsided I had expected for us tp be together she even sent me a snapchat that day to which I never answered to. So after that I decided to move on and try to avoid her. In this time I had fun with my friends while trying to get over L because I obviously still cared for her. So the months go on and I had my fair share of hookups with other girls and stuff but nothing serious to build on.

The day finally came though me and L in the same place again it was obviously weird but I took it on myself to speak to her about the silence between us. In this time I told her everything that was on my mind, I ranted for a while but I told her I wasn't interested in anything at the moment. We became friends gain after this so we started to see each other again at other friends events never alone. One night we were at the same place and I got really drunk and hooked up with her and even brought her back home (just to eat). The next day I had to ask my friends what had happened and they told me I hooked up with her. This changed a lot of things I thought to myself ""is she still into me like that?"". After this me and her acted like nothing happened we were still being friends and that it. Then she started messaging me asking when was the next time we were going to see each other because she missed hanging out with me. I took this as a signal that she wanted to somewhat try again what we had before. We hung out a couple more times and nothing happening just chilling and stuff.

Then the other day we were at a brunch together (bottomless mimosas) so everyone got loose. So when I approached her she hugged me so hard and just kept on holding on. So I looked at her and we made eye contact and I gave her a kiss but this wasn't any normal kiss it was like a boyfriend girlfriend kiss. Let me remind you this was in a room with like 30 of our friends so people saw it going down. So in that moment after I kissed her while she was still hugging me I thought it was the right moment to ask her ""You don't want to try this again from zero? You and me?"" Her smile began to fade and she shook her head. I couldn't believe it I asked her ""What?"" then she replied ""No"" I continued in disbelief ""What do you mean no?"".

So we sat down to talk about it and I was even more confused than the first time she denied me. I asked her why and she didn't even give me a concrete reason she just said ""I don't know"" which was also her to answer when I asked why she kissed me. I told her that I didn't understand why, I was just so confused and frustrated again. Then she told ""You're my favorite person in the whole world"" as if that was supposed to quell my frustration and confusion, it only added to it that was the same thing her best friend who broke my heart told me and I told L that and she just sat there in silence. She didn't even want to try it out! I wasn't asking to be anything yet I just wanted to try it out with her again because I genuinely like her and I thought she liked me. So to close the conversation I had with her I asked her "" So do I close the door on this?"" and she just nodded in silence. She continued by saying ""But we can still be friends"" I told her it was going to be different now. I just sat there for a bit and we went our separate ways.

I went home so angry and confused not understanding why. I cried that night out of frustration and sadness. I couldn't believe it, did I misread the situation completely? We were having a genuine moment there I felt significance in that kiss, I might have rushed in asking to try it out maybe I should've let the situation ride and maybe the ending would have been different but I'll never know because I went for it which is something I never do. Is she trying to play hard to get? Is she in some way playing games? Why do I still want her? Now what? Am I the problem? These are all questions I have been asking myself since. I've been pretty bummed out lately due to that situation while also feeling unmotivated and flat out sad. Do I move on? If so how? Knowing I am going to end up seeing her again due to us having many mutual friends. I don't know how to be friends with her because I just feel so strongly about the way I feel about her it might be best if I just avoid her. Onto the next heartbreak I guess.
